2016-0000,2016,Paper Session,Viewer Responses to YouTube Product Reviews: The Role of Sponsorship Disclosure and Viewers’ Expectancy,3,"This study examined whether sponsorship disclosure in YouTube product reviews or the interaction between disclosure and viewers’ expectancy of YouTube affects attitudes towards the advertised product, the reviewer, and YouTube. A sample of 192 undergraduate students was recruited at a large Midwestern university and exposed to an online survey experiment. It was found that sponsorship disclosure or its interaction with expectancy did not have a significant effect on the aforementioned attitudes. The study did determine, however, that, consistent with Expectancy Violations Theory (EVT), expectancy of YouTube exhibited a positive relationship with attitudes towards the advertised product. It also suggested a similar relationship between expectancy and YouTube vloggers. This study represents a contribution to the eWOM literature in the domain of social media advertising and an expansion of EVT to a social media advertising context. It also provides insights into viewer responses to sponsored YouTube product reviews for various stakeholders.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems

We further build on this line of research by employing psychophysiological measures (i.e., cardiac activity and physiological arousal) to explore the processes that unfold while interacting with infographics on different screen sizes.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems
2016-0002,2016,Paper Session,Busy Pedestrians: How Media Content Complexity and Sensory Modalities Influence Street-Crossing Performance in Virtual Environment,2,"People are increasingly occupied with mobile devices, even when they are walking across the street. Questions have arisen regarding the information processing deficits that might occur when people are walking while using mobile devices. The purpose of this study is to explore how sensory modalities (e.g auditory/visual) and message complexity (simple/complex) and complexity of distractions affect cognitive resource allocation and performance during a street crossing task. An experiment is designed in which participants complete a virtual street-crossing task while consuming media content of differing modality and complexity. We measure both success rate in street crossing and memory tests (recognition tests and free recall) to examine effects on attention allocation, encoding, and retrieval, respectively. We are currently preparing data collection for this project.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems
2016-0003,2016,Paper Session,Effects of Musical Complexity and Intensity on Listener Emotion,2,"Music is a powerful and prevalent mode of communication. Research continues to find that at least some of that power and prevalence comes from the relationship listeners find between music and emotion (Lonsdale & North, 2011; Rentfrow, 2012). Music consumption constitutes an event that carries with it a wide range of possible emotional reactions. However, the relationship between emotional content in music and the listener is a complicated one. Guided by Lang's (2006) LC4MP, this study explores the effect of musical qualities of Intensity and Complexity on listeners' self-reported and physiological emotional reactions. An experiment measuring facial electromyography (EMG) in the corrugator (frown) and orbicularis oculi (smile) muscles, as well as self-reported affect and enjoyment determined that intensity and complexity are distinct qualities of music as judged by the listener, and that each plays a specific role in the listener's emotional experience.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems

2016-0005,2016,Paper Session,"Information Introduced in Anime: Information Processing, Physiological Response, and Enjoyment in Entertainment Media",1,"This paper reports the data from an ongoing study that applies Information Introduced (ii), a measure of information in a video message introduced by Lang and her colleagues (Lang, Park, Sanders-Jackson, Wilson, & Wang, 2006), to entertainment television shows and its viewers. Specifically, participants watched a number of minute-long television anime show's opening theme.
Preliminary data collected from subjects to date (n=45) shows that as information embedded (value of ii) increases, subjects’ attention level also increases, but recognition memory performance drops, which suggests cognitive overload took place. However, increase in information also leads to enjoyment, which is consistent with findings from another study presented at ICA 2015 and submitted to ICA 2016 for possible presentation. Furthermore, increase in information also led to individual’s viewing intent for the whole series, suggesting that causing cognitive overload may be a useful technic to increase/sustain viewership of television shows.
Target subject size is fifty or more (N > 50). Besides physiological responses during video viewing session, self-report that includes viewing intent and recognition memory test are collected. The extended abstract will include data collected to date (n = 45).",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems
2016-0006,2016,Paper Session,The Impact of Multiple Web Ads on Attention: An Eye Tracking Study,1,"Current research on Internet advertising focus more on only one advertisement on the webpage and ignore relatively complex information, such as multiple ads on the webpage. This study applies the unique feature hypothesis to examine attentional processing in the face of two ads. An eye tracking experiment finds that the both animated condition does not receive the most attention, in accordance with the prediction of the unique feature hypothesis. In addition, the results reveal that compared with the no ads or both static conditions, the both animated condition still receives more attention.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems
2016-0007,2016,Paper Session,"Text, Image, or Text and Image?",2,"Newspaper journalists make increasingly use of photographs which have been proven to influence judgement formation. Studies show mixed results concerning the question whether images or texts have stronger effects on the evaluation of persons. When these two units give inconsistent information (divergence of image and text) the question of interactions arises. In an online-experiment (N=466) we manipulated the textual information (positive/negative) and the visual display of a politician (high/low self-assurance) in an online news article. There is a main effect of the text for all dimensions of evaluation but not for the image. Under the condition of short stimuli reception, the visual display of self-assurance in combination with positive textual information increases the perception of competence and self-assurance of the politician. Assumed effects of a divergence of image and text do not appear: positive visual displays in combination with negative textual information do not lead to a particularly negative evaluation.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems
2016-0008,2016,Paper Session,Cancer Screening Message Framing in the Social Media Environment: A Closer Look at the Role of Fear,2,"This study examined how gain-versus-loss message framing, perceived susceptibility, and virality metrics associated with social media platforms jointly influence message-induced fear and intention to perform a colonoscopy in the context of colorectal cancer screening promotion. The results showed that loss framing, coupled with high-virality metrics, resulted in greater fear particularly for individuals with relatively low perceived susceptibility to colorectal cancer. However, for individuals with relatively high perceived susceptibility, loss framing resulted in greater fear when the messages were presented with low-virality metrics. Furthermore, for those with relatively low perceived susceptibility, loss framing, when coupled with high-virality metrics, indirectly increased behavioral intention through fear. By contrast, for those with very high perceived susceptibility, the positive indirect effect of loss framing through fear was significant only when the messages were presented with low-virality metrics. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0009,2016,Paper Session,Putting the Fear Back Again: A Within-Individuals Perspective to the Role of Fear in Persuasion,1,"Empirical evidence has been absent for the fear-related propositions of the extended parallel process model (EPPM). However the studies that tested the model, and the primary studies summarized in meta-analyses all came from a between-individuals approach. A recent review suggested that a within-individuals approach might be more appropriate to investigate the role of fear in persuasion. A web-based experiment (N = 454) using tobacco warning labels was conducted to test the fear-related EPPM propositions from both between- and within-individuals perspectives, and to revisit the role of fear in persuasion. Results showed that the EPPM was not supported in the between-subjects approach, but received much stronger support from the within-individuals perspective, and that fear should play a central role in persuasion.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0010,2016,Paper Session,Feeling the Candidates: The Impact of Presidential Candidate Emotions on Voter Responses,9,This experiment investigates how the strength of coupling between emotional features of candidate communications and voters' emotional responses is related to evaluations of the candidates. Participants in a within subjects experiment were shown video clips of candidates running for U.S. President taken from the 2015 Democratic and Republican primary debates. Psychophysiological indicators of emotional response were recorded during viewing of each clip and self-report measures of attitudes toward the candidate and likelihood of voting for a candidate were obtained. This study sheds light on motivated cognitive processes potentially underlying evaluations of political candidates.,The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0011,2016,Paper Session,"Overwhelmed by a Theater-Sized Surrounded Projection Technology: Cognitive Overload, Emotional Responses, and Advertising Effectiveness Under a Large, Immersive Environment",2,"ScreenX is a technology that converts a movie theater to a huge immersive environment by using both sides of walls as screens. It resembles CAVE, a virtual reality system that employs surround projection display was introduced in the early ‘90s. However, little is known about what effect such large, immersive environment brings to viewers. Less is known about the interaction between such technology and structural features in the mediated message.
Based on the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP; Lang, 2006), this study used twelve 30-second advertisements, either fast or slow in pacing. Self-reported questionnaires including attitude towards ad and brand, as well as physiological data were collected from the subjects (N=60).
Despite the fact that cognitive overload led to some unexpected findings, advertisements shown under an immersive environment were more effective in terms of attitude towards ad, brand, and purchase intent. Also notable is that some of the effects of the immersive environment were diminished for ads edited in a fast-paced manner. This is explained in the context of LC4MP (Lang, 2006).",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0012,2016,Paper Session,Self-Esteem and Public Self-Consciousness Moderate the Emotional Impact of Expressive Writing About Experiences with Bias,3,"A substantial body of research has revealed the positive effects of expressive autobiographical writing on overall psychological and physical well-being (e.g., Pennebaker & Evans, 2014). The present research investigated a potential boundary condition for the emotional benefits of expressive writing: participants’ personality traits. The present work also centered on an event type that has received little attention in prior research - the experience of being the target of stereotypical or biased judgments. Results suggested that high self-esteem provides a buffer against negative emotions (even when writing about a negative event), while public self-consciousness appears to heighten negative responses, even though individuals were writing privately and anonymously. This study provides important insights into moderators of the effects of expressive writing, and extends this paradigm into the important domain of individuals’ experience as the targets of bias.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0013,2016,Paper Session,The Interplay of News Frames on Emotional and Cognitive Processing,2,"One of the obstacles to understanding the mechanism(s) behind framing effects in communication research is obtaining empirical evidence of the actual cognitive processing of framed messages. Guided by the “Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing” (LC4MP), this paper examines how different news frame dimensions interact to affect cognitive and emotional processing of information. Specifically, we employ psychophysiological measures to illustrate how the interplay of frame valence (gain/loss) and frame level (episodic/thematic/mix) influences attention, cognitive elaboration, information recall and emotional response. A pilot study (N=20) with 2x3 experimental design regarding the issue of child adoption among same-sex male couples reveals that information is processed differently with different frame dimension combinations. A full study (N=100) will be completed in December. Moreover, prior opinion moderates the effect of incongruent frames on cognitive and emotional processing.

2016-0014,2016,Paper Session,Poignancy and Mediated Wisdom of Experience: Narrative Impacts on Willingness to Accept Delayed Rewards,3,"Research on the impact of eudaimonic narrative has begun to identify a variety of psychologically and socially important outcomes. In the present study, we conceptually and operationally distinguish three distinctive responses to eudaimonic narrative: moral elevation, being emotionally moved, and poignancy. We, following work by Hershfield and colleagues (Ersner-Hershfield et al., 2008), suggest that poignancy, or a combination of sadness and happiness in response to life or narrative events, represents a recognition and acceptance of life’s transience and mixed joys and sorrows. Evocation of poignancy by eudaimonic narrative, then, should elicit responses associated with age, life experience, and maturity, which we refer to as “mediated wisdom of experience”. We find that brief eudaimonic video clips, compared to similar non-eudaimonic clips, increase acceptance of delayed rewards (i.e., reduced delay discounting, which has been found to be associated with maturity and negatively associated with risky and unsafe behavior in prior research), indirectly via the impact of these clips on poignant responses. In contrast, being emotionally moved showed an indirect path leading to decreased acceptance of delayed rewards, whereas moral elevation had no mediating effect.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0015,2016,Paper Session,Arousal as a Double Edge Sword in Moderating Ad Placement Effect,2,"One of the biggest differences between online video commercial and traditional TV commercial placement is that commercials online are oftentimes not placed serially but are embedded at different time points of a video. Individual ads are surrounded more by contents than by ads. This boosts the importance of content features as they were nearer to individual ads and could exert greater influence on ad effectiveness. This study is interested in exploring how video content feature (e.g., arousal) moderates the effects of ad placement on memory. Results showed that higher emotional arousal of video contents generally benefited imagery recognition of front ads (vs. back ads) but benefited recognition of verbal contents of back ads (vs. front ads). This interesting trade-off could provide important suggestions to the advertising industry in terms of strategizing ad placement depending on memory goals (reinforcing imagery vs. pinpointing verbal ad information).",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0016,2016,Paper Session,The Role of Mindset Construal and Psychological Distance Cues in Online Truth Judgments,3,"Current research presents a novel application of construal level theory (CLT) for predicting online truth judgments. Previous CLT research showed that people’s mindsets and psychological distance information embedded in messages can influence truth judgments in offline settings. We experimentally tested whether a consistency between people’s mindsets (abstract vs. concrete construal) and psychological distance cues in tweets (spatially far vs. spatially close) enhances truth judgments of tweets. While no interaction effect was found, the results revealed a main effect of distance on truth perceptions. Participants judged tweets involving information on spatially close locations as truer than tweets involving information about spatially distant locations. Findings suggest that under uncertainty psychological closeness in messages can act as a truth-heuristic. Further research is needed for a better understanding of construal level and psychological distance interaction on online truth judgments.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0017,2016,Paper Session,Why User Comments Affect the Perceived Quality of Journalistic Content: The Role of Judgment Processes,3,"User comments on news websites are frequently uncivil and lack a reasoned argumentation, and research shows that these qualities of comments can have negative effects on the perceived quality of the commented journalistic content. To date it is not clear how such effects occur. We propose three mechanisms that suggest that the comments’ impact depends on how deliberate and elaborate a commented news item’s quality is judged. This was tested in an experiment (N = 637) that varied civility and reasoning in the comments that accompanied an article, and the brand of the news website. Results show that a lack of reasoning in the comments decreased the perceived quality of the news item irrespective of brand awareness, but only at high elaboration during judgment. Incivility in the comments decreased the perceived quality of journalistic content, but only at low elaboration, and only in unknown news brands. Implications are discussed.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems

Examining the Impacts of Location-Based Social Identity on the Consumer Decision-Making Process,3,"Given the growing popularity of e-commerce activities, online consumer reviews play a key component in influencing consumer judgments and decision-making processes. This study analyzes the effects of geographic based social identity provided in online consumer reviews in regards to reviewer’s source credibility and consumer judgments. We conducted a 2 (social identity: in-group vs. out-group identity) x 2 (review valance: positive vs. negative) x 2 (product type: experience goods x search goods) between-subjects experiment. Our results found that in-group geographic identity shaped consumer’s judgments about reviewed online products and reviewers’ perceived trustworthiness. Further, we found that perceived trustworthiness predicted attitudes and purchase intentions, indicating that social identity had indirect effects on those variables through perceived trustworthiness. Implications for future research on the relationships among social identity, valence of reviews, and product types in e-commerce settings will be further discussed.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0019,2016,Paper Session,Economic Messages Alter the Brain’s Response to Error Prediction and Consequent Behavioral Decisions,3,"How can the news about economy shape people’s economic decisions? Building upon behavioral evidence provided by a previous experiment addressing effects of economic messages on economic risk taking, the current study focuses on the exact psychophysiological mechanisms behind these effects. We show that simple economic messages can alter brain electrophysiological responses associated with processing of risk and benefit, namely error prediction and reward anticipation signals. The study will provide support for the hypothesis that economic news, which often offers an abstract, vague, and yet emotionally valenced impression about the more general direction of the economy, bias people’s model of the economy and shape consequent economic behavior.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0020,2016,Paper Session,Biases in Perceived Effect of Persuasive Campaigns: Differences Between Actual and Perceived Effects of Campaign Messages,2,"This study examined errors in recall of pre-message attitude after processing persuasive messages in order to test the difference between actual and perceived effect of persuasive campaigns. It also tested whether the amount of the bias in recall of pre-message attitude moderates the relationship between actual attitude change and perceived message effect. An online-experiment was conducted with a pretest-posttest control group design (N = 196). Results showed that when attitudes changed in favor of message arguments, participants biasedly estimated their pre-message attitudes toward the direction of post-message attitudes. Second, the amount of bias in recall of pre-message attitude weakened the relationship between the actual attitude change and perceived message effect. Theoretical and practical implications of findings were discussed.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0021,2016,Paper Session,What Prompts People to Participate in Online Auctions: A Study of Bidders’ Behavioral Intention,4,"Online auction is an Internet-based activity in which participants bid for products. Auction websites are currently receiving a lot of attention, as reports indicate that nearly half of consumers who shop online have bid and bought products on online auctions. Nonetheless, despite the growing research interests of online auctions among information systems scholars, little attention has been paid to the psychological underlying causes of users’ involvement in online auctions. In this research, we build upon TAM and emotion literature, and develop a strong and parsimonious model to understand online auction users’ emotional responses and behaviors toward auction systems. 250 usable observations from users who participated in an online auction experiments were collected, and applied regression and PROCESS analyses were employed to analyze the data. Our findings highlight the role of one important aspect of emotional state – dominance – in forming behavioral intention, which has not received enough attention in explaining users’ involvement in information systems. This study contributes to both information system literature and practice related to the interactions of online auction websites and their users.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0022,2016,Paper Session,The Influence in News Stories of Criminal Intentionality and Criminal and Victim Affective Dispositions on Support for Policy About Alcohol Crimes,2,"Two studies tested if the rationalist and intuitionist sequences for forming moral judgments about story characters, proposed by Lee and Shapiro (2014), can explain how news stories about alcohol-related crimes influence support for relevant policies. Study 1 supported the rationalist sequence: participants blamed a store owner who intentionally sold alcohol to a minor (compared to a store owner presented a convincing false ID). The increased blame was associated with an increase in support for punitive policies. In Study 2, the intuitionist sequence was supported under some circumstances. Participants blamed a disliked administrator who drove drunk and caused an accident more than a liked administrator. Participants supported preventive policies more and punitive policies less when the perpetrator was a liked administrator than when the perpetrator was a disliked one; however, this effect was moderated by the timing of alcohol use questions.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0023,2016,Paper Session,Individual Differences in Intentions to Drink: Investigating the Relationship Between the BIS/BAS Scales and Accessibility,6,"Previous research has suggested that individual differences play a key role in risky decision-making. In turn, we examined how the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and the behavioral approach system (BAS), characterized by a sensitivity to reward and punishment respectively, influenced the accessibility of alcohol-related norms and attitudes. We also investigated whether or not norm and attitude accessibility mediated the relationship between these two systems and intentions to drink. 421 first-year students completed norm and attitude accessibility tasks as well as completing measures of the BIS, BAS, previous alcohol behavior, and perceived stress. Results of this study indicate that a higher BIS is positively associated with attitude accessibility and attitude accessibility subsequently mediates the relationship between the BIS and behavioral intentions. Results for the relationship between the BAS scales and accessibility were more mixed, suggesting that a sensitivity to reward may manifest in a more varied manner.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems

The potential influence of the private vs. public nature of a conversation becomes important when considering that social media provide highly public spaces for societal debates. Results from a cross-cultural experiment revealed a publicness effect in Germany, but not in Singapore. In Germany, a higher level of publicness of a controversial discussion on Facebook reduced people’s likelihood to express their viewpoint, attenuating the influence of the opinion climate. Explanations for this effect were found in users’ fears of being offended and judged by others.

Three aspects of MIM use were assessed: use intensity, relational usefulness, and stress. Data were collected through an online survey of KakaoTalk (an instant messaging application for smartphones) users in South Korea (N = 495). Those with higher interpersonal rejection sensitivity reported higher levels of use intensity and stress in their MIM use. However, interpersonal rejection sensitivity was not significantly associated with relational usefulness of MIMs. These findings indicate that mobile messaging is more stressful for those with higher interpersonal rejection sensitivity.

2016-0026,2016,Paper Session,Smartphone Conversational Etiquette: The Impact of Injunctive and Descriptive Conversational Norms on Multicommunication Behaviors,2,"This study examined the factors influencing the likelihood that people would communicate on their smart phone while engaging in face-to-face conversations (multi-communication). An online survey (N=517) found that U.S. participants' perceptions of injunctive norms (peer expectations) and descriptive norms (peer behaviors) were strongly and positively correlated with the likelihood of engaging in multi-communication behaviors. Participants tended to overestimate the extent to which others would engage in multi-communication. Perceptions that multi-communication violated conversational etiquette diminished the likelihood that people would engage in those activities. Greater engagement in multi-communication and perceived injunctive norms increased participants’ anxiety about being separated from their smart phone. Behaviors and norms varied depending upon the type of communication (work-related, family-related, or social life-related) and the conversational context (work, home, or social setting). Work related multi-communication was most common at work, but communicating about family and social life was most likely at home and in social settings.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

This may present challenges for individuals who invest heavily in these platforms because they increase the probability of observing exchanges among their friends and the likelihood of feeling inequity. 194 participants were randomly assigned to either an over- or under-rewarded communication scenario, and psychological distress was measured and used as the dependent variable. Results suggest that although participants did not report experiencing distress in the over-rewarded condition, there was a significant main effect for the under-rewarded condition such that participants who were more heavily invested in their online social network experienced distress. Results also indicated that women experienced more distress in the under-rewarded condition, opposed to men.

The comparison of face-to-face settings and computer-mediated channels on the experience of conflicts has been largely overlooked compared to other interpersonal communication factors. An original experiment examined whether different channels (face-to-face vs. video chat) through which people experience conflicts with another person affect their partner evaluation and communication satisfaction. The participants’ physiological arousal (interbeat interval, galvanic skin response) was recorded during the conversation as well as their self-reported arousal level. Results show that people who interacted face-to-face rated themselves as more aroused than those who interacted via video chat although there was no significant difference in physiological arousal. Those who interacted via video chat were better at judging their partner’s arousal than those who interacted face-to-face. After the conversation, those who interacted via video chat rated their partner to be more likable and trustworthy and were more satisfied with the result of their conversation than those who interacted face-to-face. The overall findings suggest the benefits of distance and mediation in resolving conflicts.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2016-0029,2016,Paper Session,The Positivity Bias and Prosocial Deception on Social Network Sites,2,"Can the positivity bias, observed across various Social Network Sites (SNSs), predict the use of prosocial lies in a SNS such as Facebook? The positivity bias may be a product of politeness norms (i.e., positive face concern) that have influenced communication phenomena before these sites existed. In addition, this bias may also be affected by unconscious cues or primes that promote prosocial behavior generally and on SNSs specifically. This study examined how positive face concern and surveillance primes affect prosocial lying in public and private SNS contexts. Although positive face concern and publicness predicted the use of prosocial lying, positive face concern was not affected by the publicness of the SNS context and surveillance primes did not affect positive face concern or the use of prosocial lies in this study. This hints towards the nuance of positive face concern and the potential limitations of surveillance primes on prosocial lying behavior.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

2016-0031,2016,Paper Session,Ambient Intimacy: Self-Disclosure and Parasocial Relationships on Twitter,3,"Ambient intimacy refers to an illusionary feeling of closeness towards certain others which is mainly developed by following their statues updates on social media. Previous research has demonstrated that it is possible to develop ambient awareness (i.e., a knowledge of others after browsing social media), but it is still unclear whether and to what extent Twitter users have experiences of ambient intimacy, and what types of self-disclosure help to develop such experiences. This paper is the first to theoretically distinguish the concept of ambient intimacy from ambient awareness. The results showed that the phenomenon of ambient intimacy is not as common as ambient awareness. Users were more likely to develop ambient intimacy towards a certain person when they were more frequently exposed to the tweets of that person, had more (one-sided) interaction with that person, and when the tweets of that person were perceived as more intimate, entertaining, and informative.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

For a better understanding of the human-agent interaction, the current study examines how humans respond to the AI agent’s advice during a decision-making process when there is disagreement. We conducted an experiment (n = 88) with a 2 (Embodiment: Embodied vs. Disembodied) x 2 (Labeling: Expert vs. Novice) between-subjects design. The results show that embodiment has positive effects on participants’ perception of the AI agent (e.g., perceived attractiveness and evaluation of interaction), as well as advice-taking measured by cooperation intention and compliance behavior. The result of a post-hoc mediation analysis also show that expertise-labeling has an indirect effect on advice-taking via perceived intelligence of the AI agent.

Data capitalism renders invisible the economic underpinnings and information asymmetries of commercial activity online by foregrounding the social and political benefits of networked technologies. I examine its origins in the wake of the dotcom bubble, when technology makers sought to develop a new business model to support online commerce. By leveraging user data for advertising purposes, they contributed to an information environment in which every action, digitally and increasingly in real life, leaves behind traces collected by companies for commercial purposes.

A YouTube Paradigm,3,"The one-sided relationship that exists between celebrity and viewer has long been lauded/used as the standard by which all mediated relationships are understood. However, in the context of new media, such as YouTube, it is possible that the relationship can no longer be understood as a parasocial one, but, instead, as one that is social. A survey of 449 YouTube viewers was conducted to understand the relationship that viewers believe exists between them and YouTube content creators. In particular, it explored the realities of the social interactions that the platform provides and how those interactions were affected by four independent variables: intensity, realism, identification, and interactivity.

The paper asserts that the development of U.S. cities and communication infrastructures during the period of America’s ascendency as a global power have had profound, lasting, and under-studied impacts on the nature of how community is currently theorized. Moreover, it helps demonstrate how conceptions of community can only be construed with respect to the specific technologies that obtained in particular places during particular periods of time. The place and period in question - America in the 20th century - is significant because it is there and then that American intellectual thought began to develop the contemporary’s application of the term community: as something that can be either public or private, and can be either self regulating or in need of management.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

This article borrows van Dijck’s (2013) framework of the culture of connectivity and provides a critical analysis of these two platforms. Four dimensions of connectivity are discussed: the hierarchical conversation structure, the complicated and closed-door messages, a highly privileged group of users, and the hybrid system of old and new media. While Weibo and WeChat public platform do facilitate civic engagement, they may reproduce inequality among the public rather than empower the disadvantaged groups.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Due to easy-to-use posting tools, social media especially facilitate news sharing—a behavior that has the potential to increase political involvement and engagement. Drawing from the uses and gratifications theory (UGT) and the theory of reasoned action (TRA), this study investigated the effects of motives, attitudes and intentions on news sharing behavior among German social media users (n = 333). Findings show that news sharing attitude has a positive effect on intention, which in turn has a positive effect on behavior. While the motives information seeking and socializing exerted a direct influence on news sharing attitude, intention, and behavior, status seeking only directly influenced behavior. Besides, political interest was also a significant determinant of news sharing behavior. Implications for theorizing social media related behaviors are discussed.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2016-0038,2016,Paper Session,Caring Is Not Enough: The Importance of Internet Skills for Online Privacy Protection,3,"This article explains Internet users’ self-help activities in protecting their privacy online. Using structural equation modeling and based on a representative survey of Swiss Internet users, it reveals connections between four multidimensional constructs: privacy breaches, privacy attitudes, Internet skills, and self-protective privacy behavior. As hypothesized, past experiences with privacy breaches are a strong predictor of current protective behavior. Most strikingly, however, the model indicates that Internet skills are key in explaining users’ privacy behavior. In line with the “privacy paradox” argument, caring about privacy alone does not necessarily result in substantial self-protection. Internet skills are an essential asset in information societies. They enable users to reduce risks of privacy loss while obtaining the benefits from online activities that increasingly depend on the revelation of personal data. Consequently, Internet skills are—next to privacy awareness—an essential starting point for public policies regarding the governance of users’ self-help in privacy protection.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Results from a nationwide online survey indicate that consumption of UGC is positively related to civic participation, and the relationship is moderated by three attributes of discussion networks of discussion frequency, size, and heterogeneity. These results demonstrate that the linkage between consumption of UGC and civic participation is stronger for those who discuss local politics or community issues with others frequently, with a large number of others, and with dissimilar others.

In this type of user-generated content applications, inter-personal and mass mediated types of communication converge in one medium. We examine the influence of social media communication competence and social media political expression expected outcomes on social media political expression. Results of a survey of the adult urban population of Colombian Facebook (n=598) and Twitter (n=185) users, suggest that social media communication competence, status expected outcomes and novelty expected outcomes influence political expression through social media. Furthermore, users' social media political expression expected outcomes through Facebook and Twitter differ.

2016-0042,2016,Paper Session,Exploring the De-Stigmatizing Effect of Social Media on Homosexuality in China: An Interpersonal Mediated Contact Versus Parasocial Mediated Contact Perspective,4,"The subject of homosexuality remains taboo in contemporary China, given the public maintains a considerably negative attitude toward homosexuality. Recent Pew Research (2013) indicates that, on average, 21% of Chinese respondents believe that homosexuality should be accepted. However, parallel surveys of Internet users paint a different picture as online surveys found a more liberal atmosphere toward homosexuality and same-sex marriage. The online and offline discrepancy in attitudes toward homosexuality begs the question of whether the Internet carries a stigma-reducing function in terms of views on sexual minority groups. Guided by the contact hypothesis and parasocial contact theory, the current study investigates the de-stigmatizing effect of the Internet, especially of social media, on homosexuality in China. A web-based survey with 980 heterosexual social media users confirmed the positive role of interpersonal mediated contact with homosexual celebrities via social media venues in stigma reduction; but did not lend support to the parasocial mediated contact hypothesis.

We hypothesized that anthropomorphism on a brand’s Facebook fan page can strengthen the relationships between brands and consumers by yielding both social presence and a positive inference regarding the brand’s quality as a relationship partner. Our longitudinal experiment confirmed the effects of brand anthropomorphism and the mediating role of social presence. The results suggest that when the anthropomorphized brand had relationships with consumers, consumers showed a favorable attitude toward the brand and high brand satisfaction. Also, the participants perceived the anthropomorphized brand as a trustworthy relationship partner, and they gave more Likes for the posts from the anthropomorphized brand than those from the non-anthropomorphized brand. Further, the results confirmed that these favorable relationships were maintained even after the participants became aware of a brand transgression.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Results of an experiment show that the using QR codes has a positive impact on focused attention with iPads among individuals who prefer personalized content. The effect of QR codes on felt engagement with iPads depends on the topics of personalized content people are interested in. The felt engagement with iPads decreases when using QR codes among people who are interested in business and health content, while it increases when using QR codes among people who are interested in local events. This study is the first study to examine the effect of QR code on the two different types of engagement with iPad among individuals who prefer personalized content.

Results show that reviewers who disagree with the overall rating of the target object were perceived to be less credible and had less influence on a recipient. Argument strength has a stronger effect on attitudes toward a target when the message is negative than when it is positive. Moreover, mediation analysis shows that perceived reviewer competence mediates the effect of argument strength on attitude toward the target when the message is negative. These results are consistent with Kelley’s (1973) Covariation Model and the Unimodel of Persuasion (Kruglanski & Thompson, 1999).",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Drawing on a systematic examination of mainstream television’s news contents and practices, and based on interviews with journalists, the paper analyses the coverage of human rights issues in different levels of depth by looking at motivations and limitations, resources and editorial choices. The research unveils how proximity is now being re-shaped as a news value and reinforced by the surrounding context of the financial crisis. Therefore, proximity now is both empathetic and forced: on one hand, there is a growing and persistent interest in human rights matters at a local or national level; but on the other hand, as financial cuts are applied to newsrooms, preventing reporters from travelling overseas, journalists have no choice but to look at news events at home. In this sense, the distance to remote human rights causes is increasing. From the journalists’ perspective, this inclination is undermining the possibility of a global understanding of human rights causes, but also highlighting the need to expose sensitive situations nearby.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

An investigation on the research sample - the Chinese diasporas and diasporic newspapers in Oceania shows two results. First, the diaspora, especially the transformation of sub-Chinese diasporic groups, is a major power to the survival of diasporic newspapers, including in reader and advertisement markets, and media ownership. Second, the homelands influences (mainland, Hong Kong, etc.) contribute directly to these media’s content, audience and ownership. Subsequently, comparative studies were conducted between the Chinese and the other diasporic newspapers in the six languages. Results show: while the diasporas are the vital power to all the papers, the homeland impacts are not salient on the six languages newspapers. Two reasons for the differences rely on media owner and homeland.

I investigate a spurt of ironic responses on Facebook to physical violence directed at anti-war demonstrators during the escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the summer of 2014. Contrary to the common apprehension of humor as a social lubricant, my focus here is the violent aspect of this discursive keying, mainly its excluding functionality based on the polisemic potential it incorporates. This effect is enhanced by the use of the context-collapsed platform of social network sites, poor of contextual cues for proper interpretation of the message. Finally, I mark a new interactional role, tagged here as “un-addressee”, of the failed interpreter that is excluded from the interpretive community, and by that performatively draws the social boundaries of segregation.",Intergroup Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

The sample consisted of 305 Finnish adolescents ranging from 11 to 19 years old. Results showed threat to be a significant predictor of prejudice towards Russian immigrants in Eastern Finland. Individually, negative stereotype was found to be the only threat that significantly predicted prejudice towards Russian immigrants. Realistic and symbolic threats were not important to the attitudes of Finnish adolescents towards Russian immigrants.

However, the self-validation hypothesis suggests that confidence is a plausible moderator. The self-validation hypothesis also suggests factors that can influence confidence change. This study tests the premises of these two perspectives within the framework of message discrepancy models. Japanese college students (N = 400) participated in a Web-based survey. Manipulating the participants’ argument-making during a discussion with ostensible partners, this study examined the effects of message discrepancy on participant belief and confidence change, the moderator effects of involvement and T1 confidence, and other determinants of confidence change. The results indicated that T1 confidence, but not involvement, was a significant moderator of the relationship between message discrepancy and belief change.

Building on Altman’s privacy regulation theory, we asked: Is it true, do people with less integrity feel they need more privacy? In an online questionnaire with 268 students, we found that respondents who reported more integrity needed less privacy from governments and less anonymity. In second a laboratory experiment with 87 students, we found that participants who wrote an essay about negative past behaviors afterward stated that they would need more interpersonal privacy.

2016-0077,2016,Paper Session,Perceptions of Appropriateness: Receivers’ Reactions to Message Design Logics,2,"In her theory of message design logics (MDLs), O’Keefe (1988) argues that people vary in the way they construct messages based on how they view the purpose of communication. Three types of MDLs have been identified which are ordered in increasing levels of sophistication. People may view communication as a way to vent one’s feelings (expressive MDL), as a game in which the players are obligated to follow the rules (conventional MDL), or as an opportunity to display flexibility in order to achieve one’s goals (rhetorical MDL). Because of the increased concern for the “other” expressed in higher level MDLs, it is expected that users of higher-level MDLs will be more effective in achieving their own goals, and therefore more communicatively competent (Canary & Spitzberg, 1987; O’Keefe & McCornack, 1987). A number of researchers have typically found support for this expectation, often using a variation of the “Ron Scenario” created by O’Keefe in which participants imagine they are the leader of a group in which a member named Ron has been causing problems and frustration for the rest of the group.

In this study, a modified version of the Ron Scenario was used to address two issues that have garnered little attention before now. Two-hundred thirty-seven participants were asked to imagine that they were ‘Ron’ and had received a message from their group leader (Jack or Jill) written in one of the three MDL styles. Previously reported* quantitative analyses of this data revealed that participants’ motivation to comply with the leader’s request to complete one’s work for the group was influenced by MDL style, leader gender, and respondent gender. However, motivation to comply was relatively high in all conditions, suggesting that leader messages were effective in achieving task-related goals regardless of MDL used. Although open-ended responses to the leaders’ messages were solicited at the time of initial data collection, participants’ qualitative data were not analyzed at that time. For the current study, it was predicted that participants’ perceptions of the appropriateness of the leaders’ message would increase for higher level MDLs, and that gendered expectations would also influence participants’ responses. Qualitative analysis was generally supportive of these predictions, highlighting the potential relational impact of different MDLs on one’s interactions.

This study compared perceptions of attraction and credibility between people raised by biological parents (bio subjects), those who were immediately adopted (adoption subjects), and those who were in foster care for six years before being adopted (foster subjects). The task and social dimensions of interpersonal attraction and the competence, caring/goodwill, and trust dimensions of source credibility were examined.

Conversely, TV documentary, as a particular media genre, has potential to destigmatize SMP by entrusting SMP with more authentic presence and direct voices. Drawing on narrative analysis and interviews, this article exemplifies Hong Kong case to illustrate the evolving and joint endeavor of media and mental hospital to systematically destigmatize severe mental illnesses (SMI). From 1989 to 2011, a three-episode series documentary was made by Hong Kong connections. Shifting from the narratives “whom to blame” to “nothing to fear”, the documentaries established a destigmatization scheme jointly formulated by media and mental hospital. Voices of SMP steadily increase in amount across time yet were strictly subject to the interests of mental institutions that aims to promote the rehabilitation mode of mental health care in Hong Kong.

Apple constitutes an interesting case study in this context insofar as it was a relative latecomer to what was an already maturing field of mobile mapping, launching its Maps service against established competition in the form of Google, OpenStreetMap, the (since sold) Nokia HERE, and others. Drawing on mobile infrastructure and political economy of the media approaches, my concern in this paper is twofold: first, to examine the means by which Apple has set about building its own maps infrastructure; second, to make critical sense of what Apple hopes to achieve by carving out its own place within the broader, and highly competitive, mobile mapping ‘ecosystem’. The picture that emerges is one where the possession of cartographic capabilities was considered crucial for Apple, both in developing further means of increasing revenue within its own ‘walled garden’ business model, and for protecting key assets and revenue streams from encroachment by its competitors (principally, Google).",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Drawing on empirical data and research within cultural geography, digital media and youth studies, we engage with a number of issues: the mobile phone as meaningful, mobile phones in relation to embodied mobility, and mobile phones in relation to social capital. Our aim is not only to unpack a number of concepts and assumptions underpinning the mobile phone, but also to suggest that these concepts unhelpfully (and even detrimentally) locate mobile phones in relation to the technological possibilities on offer without taking into account what is simultaneously made impossible and immobile, and for whom. Finally, when we set the digital experiences of NEET teenagers alongside the discourses around mobile phones, we find that mobility is restricted - not enabling, and that it is forged in, and articulated as part of, an everyday life that is dominated by the social and economic horizons set by the groups status as NEET.",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

However, later research findings suggest that channel choice is less rational.

This research explores channel preferences and channel behavior in multichannel service delivery of local governments in the Netherlands.

Results show that rational factors are important, like task complexity and urgency, but also less rational or situational factors influence channel choice, such as propensity, computer self-efficacy, and trust.

Conclusions are that less or non-rational determinants influence channel preferences. However, complexity also does have an impact, and so does the service that is delivered. Furthermore, urgency is a moderator for complexity.

All things being equal, customers prefer to patronize socially responsible businesses, but only when corporate ability and product quality are high will they pay premium prices. Implications for PR practitioners and scholars are discussed.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

We first investigate first and second level agenda building effects of organizations’ agendas on offline and online news agendas. Second, we investigate first and second level agenda setting effects of offline and online news agendas on the public’s agenda. While many earlier studies rely on single-measurement data, our time-series design allows for stronger causal claims. Also, while many earlier studies only take a few sources into account, for our analyses, we constructed a large-scale database that contains all press releases from organizations such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Royal Dutch Shell and Greenpeace (organizational agenda); the complete news coverage of all major online and offline sources spanning two full years (media agenda); and internet forum data and GoogleTrend data (public agenda).",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

There is also limited knowledge on how diversity is incorporated into the public relations curriculum. The goal of this study is to examine determinants of students’ perceptions of PR and related diversity issues in the field. Data were gathered among students enrolled in mass communications courses (n=417) at a large Midwestern University. Results show significant racial/ethnic differences in students’ perceptions PR (p<.05). Predictors for PR perceptions include subjective knowledge and student’s future career paths. Factors that affect their perceptions of ethnic issues in PR include their status as mass communication students, race/ethnicity, sex and their perceptions on gender issues in the public relations.

Because arguments can be made for the effectiveness, ineffectiveness, or counterproductive effect of sticky v. non-sticky message, the experiment was conducted in the spirit of discovery. Subjects were exposed to a message advocating the elimination of a coal-burning power plant. Attitude and behavioral intention were measured as outcome variables, and numerous other variables designed to probe emergent effects were assessed. Results indicated an asymmetrical message effect with the sticky message producing stronger intentions to act in conformity to message recommendations, but the non-sticky message producing attitudes indicative of greater conformity to message recommendations. These effects are explained by the differential cognitive focus required by the two messages, and by the differential motivational properties of the two messages.",Message Processing and Effects,Information Systems
2016-0106,2016,Paper Session,Effects of Message Discrepancy and Source on Information Processing: Evidence From a NON-WERID population,2,"The present research examines the effects of message discrepancy and existing source beliefs on elaboration and belief certainty among non-Western, rural, less-educated, older adults. Results show that when a message was congruent with existing issue beliefs (i.e., low message discrepancy) or when existing source beliefs were positive, participants decided whether to believe the news based on whether they had information to support it (i.e., positive test). When a message was incongruent with existing issue beliefs or when existing source beliefs were negative, participants decided whether to believe the news based on whether they had information that contradicted it (i.e., negative test). Message discrepancy and existing source beliefs exerted independent effects on the type of test, which in turn predicted belief certainty. Positive existing source beliefs led to more elaboration. When message discrepancy was low but existing source beliefs were negative, participants changed their issue beliefs.",Message Processing and Effects,Information Systems

A 2 (anonymous vs. revealed identity) × 2 (low vs. high affect intensity) × 2 (positive vs. negative valence) between-subjects experiment was conducted. In align with language expectancy theory, it is found that when the message sender is anonymous, a message with low affect intensity is more effective than a message with high affect intensity in terms of perceived message credibility and message processing depth; when the message sender’s identity is revealed, a message with high affect intensity is found more effective. Moreover, a significant interaction effect between affect intensity and message valence is also found on message processing depth. When affect intensity is low, a negative message elicits deeper processing than a positive message; when affect intensity is high, a positive message elicits more message processing.",Message Processing and Effects,Information Systems
2016-0108,2016,Paper Session,The More the Better? Examining Multimedia Effect on Organizational Health Message Dissemination,1,"Research on health information dissemination has revealed organization as a responsible information system for distributing health-related messages to their members. Empirical evidence from previous studies demonstrates a wide range of persuasiveness of messages disseminated by organizations to promote healthy behaviors among organizational members. However, very limited research has been conducted to examine the potential factors causing this variation of message persuasiveness. Aiming to fill this gap in literature, the proposed 2 (organizational identification) × 2 (multiple media) between-subjects factorial experiment investigates the interaction effects of organizational identification and multiple media on individual’s psychological outcomes upon the health messages, such as attitude, behavioral intention, perceived message quality, and information load. Building upon social identity theory, this study sheds light on examining organizational factors that could influence the effectiveness of health message dissemination within organizational information system, and provides empirical suggestions for organizational health information dissemination in practice.",Message Processing and Effects,Information Systems

Professional journalists act to keep a distance between themselves and the audience because of a perception that audience content is lower in quality and can hurt the credibility of professional content. In an e-commerce context, consumers often rate products for other consumers to use that information to make purchasing decisions. Ratings exist in the form of an aggregate consumer review and can represent an overall impression of the product. In journalism, audience ratings could serve as an alternative and complementary form of audience involvement. This study will attempt to measure if aggregate audience ratings of news content have similar effects on source credibility as have been found in e-commerce studies.",Message Processing and Effects,Information Systems

Designing persuasive campaigns and disseminating messages through popular social networking sites (e.g., Facebook) is rather easy; being strategic about it might be more complex. The current study uses a 2 (source type: corporate vs. non-profit) x 2 (congruence: congruent vs. incongruent) x 4 (message repetition) mixed factorial design to investigate the effect of anti-texting while driving PSAs via social media on attitudes and behavioral intentions. More specifically, participants (N = 219) were randomly assigned to view anti-texting while driving PSAs that varied in source and congruence. Results showed that participants expressed less favorability toward texting while driving and expressed greater intentions to refrain from texting while driving when the PSA was posted by a non-profit organization than a corporate. Corporates are more likely to elicit the desirable persuasive effects if they were congruent to the issue of texting while driving (e.g., automaker vs. grocery store). People’s intention to interact with the messages on social media predicted their offline behavioral intentions, wherein corporates and non-profits could take advantage of this and create potentially viral messages in the persuasion process.",Message Processing and Effects,Information Systems

Drawing on the essential distinction between the functional and cognitive levels of scientific analysis, this paper proposes a integrative Framework for Attitudinal Media Effects Research (FrAMER) showing why and how the mechanisms from different domain-specific processing models can all be integrated and investigated as potential cognitive-level mechanisms underlying different functional-level media effects.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems
2016-0114,2016,Paper Session,"Healthy Food Identification: Food Cues, Health Claims, and Health Halos",2,"Food is a primary biological motivator that in general creates appetitive responses, especially when the food information is very directly available to the senses. These appetitive responses may get in the way of more effortful, systematic decision making in typical food decision-making; however, health halo products, or foods that are assumed to be healthier than they actually are in conjunction with the types of claims they make may alter this pattern. This paper presents an experiment that examines how health claims interact with available food cues to affect decision-making about health halo food products. One hundred twenty-four individuals were exposed to counterbalanced product images that varied by directness of cues, type of food claims, and objective healthiness across 3 different health halo food products. Participants evaluated products by completing two latency categorization tasks. In general, results support that individuals are susceptible to health halos in general but that congruency of the claims matters. Further, food cues are used to help make determinations when incongruence exists.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems

Through two experiments, we find people tend to take an actor’s perspective when interpreting moral characters, indicated by higher level of egocentric projection into the character, identification with the character, paying closer attention to their unintentional behaviors, and providing more mechanical causes to explain these behaviors. In contrast, when processing immoral characters, people tend to take an observer’s perspective by focusing more on intentional behaviors. This research extends our understanding of the role of character morality in narrative processing and conditions under which people would use different mental inference strategies to understand a media character.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems

We propose that information engagement can be conceptualized in relation to levels of cognitive involvement and issue relevance, as three distinct behaviors that range along a continuum from least active to most active: (1) Information scanning, (2) information seeking/selective exposure, and (3) information sharing. We conclude with specific recommendations for conceptual and operational definitions and measures of information engagement, and propose a research agenda for theorizing effects and pathways of information engagement on substantive outcomes across different domains within communication.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems

This presentation is about the consequences of negative stereotypes and devaluing content on members of the negatively portrayed groups (e.g., women, Latino Americans, older adults). More specifically, we focus on stereotype threat, a detrimental, stress-related state which leads to performance decrements and disidentification from negatively stereotyped topics and career options.
We introduce the first meta-analytic summary of existing findings that relate negative cognitive performance and disidentification to mediated stereotypes (such as gender-stereotypical TV-ads or newspaper articles). Our search in databanks (Communication MMC, PsycINFO, etc.) and through mailing lists and social media yielded 182 potentially relevant references. A further inspection of full texts revealed 25 independent studies that are relevant, with requests for four additional studies currently pending.

2016-0118,2016,Paper Session,Electroencephalographic Reponses to Gay Imagery in Advertising,3,"Advertisements featuring gay imagery are becoming increasingly popular, but potentially negatively affect purchase intentions and attitudes towards brands that utilize this imagery. Although self-reported anti-gay attitudes have been shown to enhance these effects, self-reported attitudes may be subject to social desirability and not accurately reflect the manner in which behavior is affected. The use of electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques to investigate this phenomenon eliminates concerns about socially desirable responding. Furthermore, EEG has the potential to elucidate the timecourse of neural mechanisms by which consumer attitudes and behavior are affected. The current study aims to examine the timecourse of early selective attention, violation of expectancies, and emotion processes in response to advertisements featuring gay imagery using EEG. The N1, N2, P3 and LPP may help reveal if purchase intentions and brand attitudes are negatively affected via attention, the “novelty” of seeing gay couples in advertisements, and/or via emotional responses to the advertisements.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems

One proposed intervention to address these issues across populations is to require that chain restaurants and similar establishments provide nutrition information, such as calorie labels, on menu items. This study therefore aims to examine the effect of menu calorie labeling on food and beverage choices of emerging adults. Results of a between-subjects experiment (n = 179) revealed that calorie labeling increased the likelihood of choosing lower calorie food and beverage options. Moreover, calorie labeling only led to selecting a lower calorie food option among those with high self-control, but not among those with low self-control. This moderating effect was not revealed for beverage choice. Public health practitioners and policymakers should consider intervention approaches that address other drivers of choice, such as self-control, in addition to nutrition information.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems
2016-0120,2016,Paper Session,Situational and Issue Involvement as Determinants of Search Engine Usage Behavior,2,"While there is a general consensus that search engine usage behavior is mostly influenced by the ranking—the majority of users only selects the top-ranked search results linked on the first search engine results page—, both situational and personal factors are able to shape this behavior as well. Furthermore, the sole employment of the ranking heuristic poses considerable threats for users, especially when searching information on substantial topics like politics and health. Thus, we examine how differences in involvement—differentiating between involvement by situational factors, and involvement by interest in and knowledge about the researched issue—are able to influence the search process.
Search engine usage behavior of student participants regarding an open-ended informational task was observed, with situational involvement experimentally manipulated and issue involvement surveyed. Preliminary results show that while highly involved users search more thoroughly, they still largely rely on heuristics.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems

The current study collected tweets during the National Diabetes Month with a focus on diabetes-related organizations (N = 17,659). By employing network analysis methods, we ran Exponential Random Graph Modeling (ERGM) to examine the patterns and structures of communication via three major conversational features of Twitter: retweet, reply, and mention. The findings will shed light on information dissemination process on Twitter: how information is exchanged and communicated among Twitter users through the three conversational features. By taking a health promotion case, the current study provides implications for health organizations in their use of social media platforms in public health promotion efforts.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks,Information Systems
2016-0122,2016,Paper Session,Convergence or Divergence: Exploring Different Mechanisms Driving NGOs’ Cross-Platform Interorganizational Networks,3,"In the context of rapid proliferation of networking among nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), these organizations today are adopting multiple technology platforms— from organizational websites to networked social media—to communicate alliance relationships to their stakeholders. With the creation of multiplex, cross-platform interorganizational relationships, there is a need to understand (1) whether and how the underlying connection logics (i.e., interorganizational partner choice) may differ across these platforms; and (2) how platform-specific features may relate to the structure of interorganizational networks. Combining institutional theory of organizations and the technology affordance approach, this paper uses the international children’s rights NGO community as a case to examine how NGOs build and communicate alliance relationships across two major online platforms: organizational websites and Twitter, with their offline interorganizational network being the network of comparison. ERGM and descriptive network analysis were used to test three hypothesized connection logics driving the interorganizational network across different technology platforms. Results identified a stronger “rich-gets-richer” tendency in the online interorganizational networks, and geographic proximity turned out as a weaker mechanism shaping organizations’ online network than their offline counterpart.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks,Information Systems

However, SNSs are interesting venues to investigate e-WOM because they show more complex dynamics and behavioral patterns than the ones in early online platforms do. Thus, this study intends to find out social, motivational and external factors of e-WOM in the SNS and how tie strength and message characteristics interact with them, based on the Social Capital Theory, the Elaboration Likelihood Model and other concepts.

By adopting communication privacy management theory, we conducted a survey with 526 subjects and examined their privacy management on social network site and the factors and conditions contingent upon which they decide to reveal or retain private information. The results show that people set different privacy boundaries or “layers” for different types of personal information. Information about social identity anddaily life and entertainment tends to be shared more publically on SNS, while personal contact information is kept more private. We identified knowledge of and concern with technology ubiquity and companies’ business strategies using Big Data as the strongest predictors of privacy protection behavior and privacy settings on Social Networking Sites (SNS).

2016-0125,2016,Paper Session,How the Depth and Breadth of Online Networks Define the Use of Facebook’s Privacy Settings,5,"Social media has made it possible to maintain a variety of relationships online. These relationships range in depth—from weak acquaintances to strong, close ties. Likewise, they range in breadth—from connections with those who are distant and heterogeneous, to those who are proximal and similar to the user. Social media sites like Facebook allows users to manage how they appear to these groups through the use of privacy settings that provide control over information privacy, accessibility privacy, and expressive privacy. The current work examines whether the types of relationships people maintain on Facebook determine their utilization of these privacy settings. Results suggest a determinant role of the tie strength: users protect information privacy based on the closeness and heterogeneity of their online connections, while surprisingly, the use of privacy settings for expressive privacy was contingent only upon network closeness. Implications for the design of usable privacy are discussed.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks,Information Systems

In this study, the centrality measures indicate where a cancer patient is located in the online social network developed in an computer-mediated social support (CMSS) group, which shows the patient’s advantageous position to access valued resources embedded in the social support networks. To that end, we used secondary data from two randomized clinical trials examining the effects of an eHealth system that include CMSS group services. Interpersonal communication networks were established by identifying the referred persons or targets in a message posted in the CMSS group. Out of 243 participants, 117 developed interpersonal relationships. Findings show that a person’s centrality had a positive impact on information competence when the person was included in a low-density network, while it had modest influence for those who located in a high-density group.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks,Information Systems

This study seeks to clarify how merely viewing the interactions of others can meaningfully influence impressions of the source. Specifically, this study explores responsiveness and tailoring as key facets of interactivity. The results indicate that viewing specific types of interactions impact perceptions of interactivity. In addition, there is a significant indirect effect of the source providing responses to existing messages, through participants’ perceptions that they could receive a response, on attitudes toward the source and behavioral intention. There is also a significant indirect effect of the source providing tailored responses to existing messages, through participants’ perceptions that they could receive a tailored response, on assessment of quality of future interactions with the source, attitudes toward the source, and behavioral intention.

This study conceptualized coping and coping styles based on the theoretical perspective of the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP). The reconceptualization was tested and results showed that defensiveness in the Weinberger model and cognitive avoidance in the Krohne model map onto defensive system reactivity and appetitive system reactivity, respectively.

Results suggest that arousal level of stimuli affects time perception with stimuli of higher arousal level judged significantly longer compared to those of the lowest arousal level. Consistent with previous findings, an interaction pattern between valence and arousal was observed. Following motivational activation trajectories, positive and negative stimuli elicited distinct time judgment responses when the level of arousal changed from moderate to high. In sum, the human motivational system modulates cognitive processes and emotional experiences that influence the perceptions of time passage. However, these effects were more salient in short durations and would disappear with 6s duration, a response which also reflects the fast and automatic aspects of the motivational activation system.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

The aim of this experimental research is to derive a better understanding of the inspiring effects of unsuccessful story characters on people’s motivation. We suggest that people in an experimentally induced regulatory state of prevention-focus (i.e., striving to avoid disasters) are most motivated by unsuccessful story characters, because the character illustrates a feared self and also information how to avoid possible failure. In contrast, if people are in a regulatory promotion state (i.e., striving to achieve an ideal self and success), they will only be motivated by a successful story character. As another contribution to research on narrative persuasion, we also expect that the effect of regulatory fit (consistency between people’s and the character’s regulatory state) on motivation will be mediated by transportation.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

Their effects on recipients’ well-being and motivational states, however, received relatively little attention. Building on exemplification theory and social comparison theory, the current study examines effects of student exemplars on readers’ intentions to change their learning behaviors, and studies the role of subjective well-being in this process. Respondents read an article that was manipulated regarding (1) the success of the depicted students (very successful vs. very unsuccessful), (2) gender (male vs. female exemplar), and (3) origin of feedback (self-evaluation vs. from external sources). Findings show that successfulness and origin of feedback affect students’ learning-relevant behavioral intentions, and that these exemplar effects are moderated by respondents’ gender and relationship status. All three dimensions of subjective well-being (positive affect, negative affect, and current life satisfaction) mediated the effect of exemplar successfulness on behavioral intentions.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

The Motivated Affective Behavioral System (MABS) fills in the general sketch given by Bowlby (1969) of his behavioral systems meta-theory (of which attachment is one domain). Bowlby’s theory is both an evolutionary and developmental theory in which specialized innate systems become tuned by the environment. MABS is a model of one such system that shows how individual differences arise from experience through self-regulatory processes. MABS specifies the organization of psychological components: a schematic frame (or working model), motivation, and emotion that mediate between different attachment situations and message production. These patterns of experience self-organize from the decision rules of individual psychological components to produce support-seeking, protesting, or dismissive message contents. The model shows how self-regulatory processes respond to uncertainty of interpersonal outcomes and how, over time, these responses can lead to chronic biases in communicating.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

2016-0137,2016,Paper Session,Advertising Strategies for Hedonic vs. Utilitarian Brands: The Risk of Omitting Warmth or Competence Dimension,2,"Research has shown that consumers perceive brands, just like people, on two basic dimensions: warmth and competence. As a result, the so-called hedonic brands try to create a pleasant experience for the costumer, thus highlighting the warmth dimension, while utilitarian brands emphasize the competence dimension. Research on the innuendo effect has shown that if a person is described positively only on one dimension, people make negative inferences on the other. In the present study, we are interested in determining if this effect also emerges in the advertising context when a brand is only described on one of the two dimensions. Furthermore, we investigate what differences exist when different types of brands (hedonic vs. utilitarian) are promoted and how this connects with consumers’ attitudes toward these brands. Using a 3x3-experimental design, we find an innuendo effect that is independent of which type of brand is promoted and what dimension is omitted.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems
2016-0138,2016,Paper Session,Making a Name on Social Media: How Advertising With a Human Name Affects Product Attitudes in the Context of Electronic Word of Mouth,3,"Marketing communication managers and advertising scholars are increasingly recognizing the potential of anthropomorphism—the idea that products that look and act human-like are more positively evaluated than products that do not look and act as such. The present research focuses on a previously under-researched advertising strategy to imbue human traits onto a product, namely human product naming. It sheds light on whether and why products that are christened with a human name instigate more positive consumer responses than products with non-human names. In addition, it examines whether the directionality and intensity of these responses is affected by the valence of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on the product. Results from two experiments show that human-named products (vs. non-human named products) have a positive indirect effect on product attitudes through the process of anthro-pomorphism. In addition, the valence of eWOM is demonstrated to weaken (negative eWOM) or strengthen (positive eWOM) this indirect effect. These findings offer a unique theoretical contribution to the field on brand personification and anthropomorphism, and provide adver-tisers with valuable and actionable insights.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems

Little is known, however, about how reading brand messages passed along by social media contacts influences online brand communication outcomes. Results of a survey with active social media users indicate that (1) message evaluation, (2) the relationship with the sender, and (3) the receiver’s opinion leadership and opinion-seeking levels influence not only the receiver’s intention to pass along the message further, but also his or her attitude towards the brand. The implications of these findings are discussed, including how these capabilities brought on by social media change the brand-consumer relationship online.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems

The experiment developed analyzed two versions of one brand’s video advertisements in which the featured persuasion appeal was manipulated. The results shown that when being exposed to informational advertising appeal, people with high need of cognition (NFC) are more likely to engage with the brand content compared to people with low NFC. In addition, when being exposed to emotional advertising appeal, people with high preference for affective (PFA) are more likely to engage with brand content compared to people with low PFA. Furthermore, in general, advertisement featuring emotional appeal is more effective than advertisement featuring informational appeal on social media, in terms of consumer engagement.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems

Results revealed that (a) the third-person perceptions did take place in the context of celebrity endorsed advertising, (b) all three celebrity credibility variables were negatively correlated to advertising skepticism, but only celebrity attractiveness and expertise yielded direct effects, (c) indirect effects by the first-person perceptions were stronger than those by the third-person perceptions on advertising skepticism. Theoretical implications and practical insights were discussed to indicate that Taiwanese consumers did not want to be perceived as celebrity followers for a self-enhancement purpose, but their presumed influence on themselves played a more active role than their presumed influence on others in mediating their perceptions of celebrity credibility and diminishing their skepticism toward celebrity endorsed advertising.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems

The determining brand-related drivers of this behavior, however, are still largely unexplored. Based on the assumption that consumers publicly engage with branded content in part to communicate their identity to others, recent research found that the main domains of social and brand perception, warmth and competence, are strong predictors of liking brand pages on Facebook. In line with this notion, and analyzing 14,993 Facebook messages and 54,653 tweets of 19 different for- and nonprofit brands, the present study investigates to what extent brands’ warmth and competence predict the financial effort needed to achieve engagement from consumers with branded content. Results show brands that score low on warmth but high on competence need to make the highest effort to receive endorsement (likes, favorites) and information diffusion (shares and retweets) on their content.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems

How directly food is portrayed alters this response and as such alters how it is evaluated. Sexual appeals also elicit automatic approach responses. This study examined how these biological motivators affected responses to food ads. Ads initially portrayed food as very appetizing and ready-to-eat or in packages and not ready-to-eat. The ads also varied in presence of a sexual appeal. In general, results support that unpackaged food is more appetitive overall. Further, sexual appeals created decrements in these ratings, especially when food was portrayed very directly. However, physiological patterns of appetitive activation did not map onto these ratings. Individual differences moderated these effects.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems

However, this study focuses on brain activity differences during the priming exposure in hopes of understanding the mechanisms of the priming effect on subsequent electronic brainstorming (EBS). To date, little attention has been paid to differences in dynamic brain activity during the presentation of emotional supraliminal primes. Furthermore, little research has examined individual differences in response during the same priming condition, i.e., why idea generation differs across people presented with identical primes. As such, this study attempts to first explore the differences in brain activity patterns during achievement and neutral image primes.

Affective Content as a Moderator,2,"Endorsement cues on social media (e.g., “Trending”, number of “Likes” or “Retweets”) lead to more interest. Our experiment examines the effects of social endorsement of both stimulating and non-stimulating content on physiological arousal (skin conductance level). We found that stimulating pictures triggered more physiological arousal than non-stimulating pictures, but only when the picture was framed as a “trending” picture. When the picture was labeled as a “non-trending” picture, non-stimulating pictures induced higher levels of physiological arousal than stimulating pictures. Our study lends insight into how people respond to endorsement cues on social media from an affective level. More importantly, it shows that endorsement on social media is not the panacea for receiving attention; the inherent nature of the content plays a critical role in how the social cues are perceived.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems
2016-0148,2016,Paper Session,Sharing for the (Social) Self and Others: Neural Mechanisms Driving Broad- and Narrowcasting,4,"A sharer’s audience, and specifically audience size, significantly impact what is shared, and how shared content is framed. Prior research argued that broad- (sharing with many) and narrowcasting (sharing with one or few) are distinguished by stronger default egocentrism during broadcasting. This leads to self-enhancement driven sharing, which is only replaced by more effortful social cognitions when the situational social complexity is low during narrowcasting. In contrast, social and cognitive neuroscience support a sociocentristic perspective on sharing, where self-related and social cognitions are not mutually exclusive, but co-occur during both narrow- and broadcasting. Narrowcasting should further engage both cognitions more intensively, because smaller audiences allow more in-depth scrutiny of contextual information. Our fMRI data support a sociocentric sharing framework, suggesting more in-depth message processing both in terms of self-relevance and social impact of shared content during narrowcasting. Narrowcasting might thus allow for stronger message effects on sharers and their audiences.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems
2016-0149,2016,Paper Session,Neural Mechanisms Associated With Social Influence Predict Social Influence on Driving Risk,9,"Social influence is pervasive throughout life and adolescents are often more susceptible. We tested whether neural regions previously shown to be involved in susceptibility to social influence on recommendation behavior, including reward processing and mentalizing (considering the mental states of others) regions, also predicted social influence on driving risk one week later in a full-cab driving simulator. Results demonstrated that neural activity functionally defined by conformity in the fMRI recommendation task (VS+VMPFC) predicted risky behavior in the presence of a risky peer. In addition, results demonstrated that differences in rTPJ activity, a region commonly associated with mentalizing, was significantly associated with safer behavior in the presence of a safe peer during the driving simulator session. These results provide insight into neural underpinnings of social influence that extend from the fMRI lab to social influence on risk-taking in an important context relevant to real-world life and death decisions.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems
2016-0150,2016,Paper Session,Breaks in Presence and Psychophysiology: Assessing a Broad Range of Measures in an Ecologically Valid Setting,5,"Assessing presence using questionnaires can yield interesting insights into the user experience in virtual environments, but is also limited both in reliability and in validity. Breaks in presence (BIPs) are an interesting alternative, given that the researcher can assess them correctly. Prior studies on the psychophysiology of BIPs followed an exploratory approach by not providing a cognitive mechanism for BIPs and lacking in external validity. We argue that BIPs can be considered a special form of orienting responses involving both the real and the virtual world. In the first of the presented studies, we investigated, which types of BIPs can be differentiated and to what degree they impact the user experience. In the second study we modified a commercial video game by introducing the previously identified BIPs and recorded psychophysiological measurements.

2016-0151,2016,Paper Session,When Faces Blur the Uncanny Valley: Physiological and Cognitive Responses to Category Conflict,1,"Many scholars and designers have chased the elusive uncanny valley (UV). Mori’s (1970) theory claims that as artificial entities increase in human likeness, people are attracted to them until they reach a tipping point, and are then rejected due to an unsettling feeling of intense discomfort. Some research suggests that instead of affinity and humanness, UV reflect a person’s ability to identity artificial objects (i.e. virtual character). Objects blurring category lines may create mental conflict that engages the autonomic arousal system, and thus strong emotional responses. Participants viewed images from different categories: singular categories (human, animal, and robot) and crossed categories (human-human mixes, human-animal mixes, and human-robot mixes). Preliminary examination of the data suggest that differences exist in how participants physiologically and cognitively respond to the various categories, with high arousal levels associated with mixed categories and higher levels of reported creepiness.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems
2016-0152,2016,Paper Session,Examining Characteristics of Personality Measures in Physiological Responses During Emotional Stimuli and Risky Behaviors,3,"This study examines how three motivationally relevant personality traits in (the motivational activation measure, MAM Lang et al., 2005, the behavioral inhibition and activation system, BIS-BAS, and Sensation Seeking (SS)) differentially relate to physiological measures of cognitive processing and behavioral measures of risky behaviors in Japanese youth. In this study event-related potentials (ERP) was measured while 20 Japanese college students looked at emotional pictures selected from the International Picture System (IAPS). In addition heart rate (HR) was measured while they were watching two video clips of positive and negative emotional content. Preliminary results suggest that the affective system reactivity measure (ASA) of MAM has a main effect on ERPs while looking at pictures and the SS measure has a Valence×SS interaction on the same data. When looking at the behavioral measures, SS and BAS explained drinking behavior better than ASA. However, participants’ interest in drug use was only explained by MAM. The importance of understanding relationships of these various individual trait measures with processing and behavioral variables is, on its own important, but even more important is to begin to investigate if results found with American youth generalize to youth of other cultures.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems
2016-0153,2016,Paper Session,Evaluative and Descriptive Media Ratings and the Forbidden Fruit Effect,3,"Media ratings classify media products in order to restrict children’s and adolescents’ access and exposure to harmful media contents. Evaluative ratings recommend for what age groups particular media is suitable while descriptive ratings illustrate the specific category of detrimental content. However, media ratings are said to instigate an undesirable side effect as they may increase the attractiveness of the media product; the forbidden fruit effect.
An experiment was conducted in order to investigate whether a combination of evaluative and descriptive ratings have a more appealing effect on minors than restricting media with either evaluative or descriptive ratings.
The results clearly signify that neither evaluative ratings nor descriptive ratings increase the perceived attractiveness, whereas personal traits and demographic factors were proven to have an effect.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The study found that children who trust others in the real-world and report a strong need to belong with others are more likely to trust popular media characters in the para-world. This relationship was especially strong for girls’ trust of boy characters. The ability to trust peers in the real-world was positively related to liking popular peer-like television characters, trusting those characters was related to naming those characters as friends, and same-sex characters were more likely to be named as friends, especially for girls.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

In doing so, we first explore the prominent role of agency in the literature on contemporary (participating) audiences. Through a sociologically informed analysis of taste cultures, we explore to what extent contemporary audiences make individually informed choices on media preferences. We thus study insofar structure-informed stratification informs these genre preferences, which in their turn lead to identifiable group preferences. Second, we aim to contribute to the understanding of media consumption in general and film consumption in particular, by studying youth – a group well known to adapt with ease to new technologies. Grounded in a representative sample of 1015 respondents aged 16 to 18, we will argue that research on contemporary media practices can greatly benefit from sociologically informed understanding of consumption.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

In the area of intimate relationship study, romantic attachment style is the primary theoretical framework. Meanwhile, the use of Social Networking Sites is prevailing among college students. And surveillance is found to have potential positive effect on relationship quality. The present study aims to explore the influences of romantic attachment style on relationship quality, and the moderate effect of surveillance during this process from individual and couple level. Study 1: Based on the survey of 320 college students who were in or once had been in a relationship, we found that: (1) two dimensions of romantic attachment, both anxiety and avoidance had negative effects on relationship quality. (2) Surveillance can relieve the decline of relationship quality caused by avoidant attachment, not by anxiety. Study 2: 250 college dating couples were recruited in. By adopting the Actor and Partner Interdependence Model, we found that: (1) for both male and female students, anxiety and avoidance dimensions had negative effects on the partner’s relationship quality. (2) Male’s surveillance on Social Networking Sites had moderate effect during the process of female students’ avoidance predicting relationship quality of male students. Conclusion: (1) Both anxiety and avoidance have negative effects on the self’s and the partner’s perceived relationship quality. (2) Surveillance can alleviate the drop of relationship quality caused by avoidant attachment only. And the compensation for relationship quality that is damaged by the partner is only effective for males.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Aiming to enhance public awareness about the parent-child relationship, Chinese television has produced some entertainment-education programs about the parent-child relationship, of which Babaqunaer (“Dad, where are we going?”) is one. This article analyzes the effect of Babaqunaer using different designs and participants. Two studies were conducted—a longitudinal study using college students as a sample and another using married people with children. Both studies involved audience interaction and media exposure, which are core variables in the mechanism of the entertainment-education effect. The results indicated that 1) the degree of parasocial relationships partly predicted the entertainment-education effect; 2) parasocial relationships will change over time but cannot predict the long-term effect of the entertainment-education program; 3) interpersonal communications related to the entertainment-education program predicted the entertainment-education effect; and 4) for college students, more frequent viewing of the entertainment-education program led to a stronger effect.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

However, language barriers between different generations due to language shifts and loss of heritage languages can still be a challenge for meaningful intergenerational bonding through game play. In order to have a better understanding of the effectiveness of using games for intergenerational communication in the presence of language barriers, we report on a longitudinal field experiment which explores the role of language as an indicator of social group boundaries as well as the impact of goal attainment on game partner perceptions. Using the Nintendo Wii for intergenerational gaming, we test the effects of language (common language vs. no common language) and goal attainment (success vs. failure) on various dependent variables.",Game Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Both individual factors (such as impulsivity and reward sensitivity) and content features in video games (such as the reward and punishment features) play a role in the development of video game addiction. The reward schedules in video games, particularly partial reinforcement effects, are thought to play an important role in video game addiction. Yet little is known about these reward schedules or how they vary across games. In the current study, a quantitative content analysis is conducted to categorize the reward structures and their temporal sequence of rewards in three different video games from various genres.",Game Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2016-0173,2016,Paper Session,Why Are Players Attracted to Counterstrike Clans? The Role of Need Satisfaction Perceived in Clan-Life and Perceived in Daily Offline Life,1,"POSTER PROPOSAL: In reference to studies on causes and consequences of using interactive media like the Internet (Shen et al., 2013) and computer games (e.g. Ryan et al., 2006), the current study applied Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to the context of first-person shooter clans. Based on a sample of 585 Counter-Strike clan players, structural equation modeling shows that clans could help players to satisfy their needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy and that need satisfaction in clan-life is positively connected to clan engagement and short-term well-being after spending time with clan-life. Considering need satisfaction perceived in offline life as a background factor, the study further shows that players with problems in satisfying psychological needs in offline life more highly engage in clan-life, but less likely experience positive psychological effects when spending time with clan-life. These results are discussed against the background of existing SDT-based studies on games and excessive media usage.",Game Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Interactions with SPs in preclinical years allow for practice of clinical and communication skills in a setting where educators give feedback and evaluate performance to prepare students for real patient encounters. SPs generally provide low-stress encounters by being friendly and cooperative. While this training has prepared medical students well, it remains largely unknown how interactions with uncooperative, hostile SPs affects students. In this study, a SP was randomly assigned to display either calm (control) or hostile (experimental) behavior and SP and medical student communication was recorded. Linguistic analysis was employed and cortisol readings were taken from students following the interactions. The primary aim of this research is to assess felt stress and monitor language used by SPs and medical students during these high and low stress encounters.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Based on formative researh, acampaign was conceived to build support for alcohol policy reform. The campaign aims to 1) reframe alcohol debate from medical to a social justice issue with policy solutions 2) educate non-medical spokespeople on alcohol policy 3) change norms around drunkenness.

The campaign is run by a social enterprise and funded by grants. Building a dialogue with alcohol discourse, the approach is opportunistic and uses many methods range from active social media coverage and small-group seminars to mass media.

In the first two years of the campaign, the phrasing “Let’s drink less by half” appeared in prime ministers’s inauguration speech and in government coalition program as an aim for 2030.

We conducted a 2 (interactivity: interactive vs. non-interactive) x 2 (message framing: gain- vs. loss-framed) between-subject experiment on the Web (N = 246). Interactivity significantly increased perceived control over character’s decisions, which in turn transferred to greater identification with the character. However, this finding was limited to the gain-framed narrative. When the reader made unhealthy decisions for the character and thus exposed to the loss-framed narrative, interactivity significantly decreased character identification and intentions to vaccinate against influenza.

Previous research shows that differences in emergency levels of pro-social situations also account for differences in the decision making processes of a bystander.
A 2 (high versus low danger) x 2 (gain versus loss frame bystander) x 2 (gain versus loss frame victim) online experiment (n = 327) was carried out to test for assumed influences on decision processes. Awareness of potential bystanders is increased by more dangerous emergencies as well as messages that focus on the benefits of bystander intervention.

In particular, this study investigates the influence of actual social support and online social support (i.e., information support and emotional support) within an online community on the psychological quality of life within Korean PD patients. To test the mediation effects of PD patients’ emotions toward their disease, this study employs Situation-Specific Emotional Reactions (SSER) (i.e., uncertainty and positive feelings) as multiple mediation variables between actual social support/online social support and psychological quality of life. The findings of this study suggest that 1) emotional social support from Computer-Mediated Support Groups (CMSGs) is an important factor improving the psychological wellbeing of Korean PD patients because it increases positive feelings and 2) actual social support is important because it reduces uncertainty, which in turn enhances the PD patient’s psychological quality of life.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Affective and intuitive evaluations of media influence are not studied extensively. This paper employed focus group discussion with a projective assessment (i.e. cloning exercise) to reveal how 20 young males, aged 19 to 22 in Australia, associated their body and self-image issues with mediated imagery on both the conscious and unconscious levels. Results showed that participants tended to be less satisfied with their weight and most satisfied with their height. They believed that their female friends would be more influenced by these images compared to themselves and other male friends.

This study tests the mediation model, examining the relationship between media use, attribution to self and a government, risk perceptions, and behavioral intention concerning three epidemic diseases: foot-and-mouth disease, mad cow disease, and H1N1 flu. The nationwide online survey (N = 1,001) revealed that media use increased attribution to self and a government. Also the findings indicated that attribution to a government predicted risk perception and then risk perception increased behavioral intention. Analyzing the mediating relationships in the model, we found that media use had significant indirect effect on behavioral intention when attribution to a government and risk perception as mediators were used. The finding suggests that attribution to a government and risk perception are key mediators in the model.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

As consumers have been employing more diverse practices of information seeking subsequent to DTCA exposure, this study investigates how different information seeking practices (i.e., professionals-involved and self-directed information seeking) influence the brand-name medication preference and prescription request. To explore this question, consumers’ self-reported exposure and response to DTCA was drawn from the MARS (Multimedia Audience Research Systems) OTC/DTC Pharmaceutical Study of 2013. By using Bayesian estimation, this study shows that (1) DTCA prompts both self-directed and professionals-involved information seeking, (2) the effects of DTCA on brand preference is mediated by information seeking, in which brand-name medication preference was strengthened by information seeking, and (3) in turn, DTCA exposure indirectly increases Rx medication request.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

As a next step we developed messages that target these determinants together and separately to test the combined and single effects on cancer patients’ affective attitudes, injunctive norm and intention. We used a pre-test post-test design with four conditions (attitude message, norm message, combined message, information message).We found time-effects for all the determinants but no differences between the conditions. A second data-collection was conducted to examine whether the time-effect was caused by exposure to a message or a baseline questionnaire. Again we found the time-effect in all conditions.

Although individualizing medical care is not a new concept, precision medicine’s ability to identify diseases early, and to tailor treatments that align with a patient’s genetic characteristics more accurately, promises a substantial improvement over the one-size-fits-all approach often used today. However, the success of precision medicine is reliant upon patient uptake of genetic testing, and recruiting a cohort of demographically diverse patients to develop treatments for a wide selection of patient subgroups. To do so, historically low rates of research participation among minorities must be overcome. Therefore, this study used an online survey to assess current levels of public knowledge, and identify differences in the most salient perceived benefits and harms of precision medicine between African Americans (n=420) and Caucasians (n=420).

The objective of this paper is to study the differences and similarities between antecedents that contribute to travel opinion leadership and travel opinion seeking. It proposes a model that includes both social and product related consumer traits as antecedents of opinion leadership and opinion seeking. Data was collected via an online survey (N = 400) and analyzed using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The results showed that high product category involvement and connectivity were related to opinion leadership, whereas individual’s susceptibility to informational interpersonal influence and consumer novelty seeking were associated with opinion seeking. The implications of these results are discussed.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2016-0207,2016,Paper Session,Closing the Gender Gap in STEM With Male Instructors? On the Effects of Rapport Behavior and Gender of a Virtual Agent in an Instructional Interaction,6,"While numerous research endeavors address the effects of pedagogical agents, the role of the agent´s gender and its rapport behavior has been neglected. We hypothesize that a minimal amount of behavioral realism induced by display of rapport is necessary for any social effects to occur in human-computer interaction. Further, in line with results from STEM research on female role models, we assume that especially for female learners a same sex agent will be beneficial. In a 2(student gender)x2(agent gender)x2(rapport behavior yes/no) between subjects design, we investigate whether virtual agents can help enhance participants’ performance, effort and motivation in mathematics. Female and male participants (N = 128) interacted with a male or female virtual agent that either displayed rapport or no rapport. Our results confirm the expected main effect of rapport. However, against expectations, our results do not support the assumption that a same sex agent is beneficial for female learners. Participants’ performance and effort were significantly enhanced when interacting with an agent of opposite gender that displayed rapport.",Instructional and Developmental Communication Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2016-0208,2016,Paper Session,"Mindfulness, Academic Resilience, and Positive Emotions",1,"Mindfulness, non-judgmental awareness in the present lived experience, is an important aspect of flourishing and leading a meaningful life. Researchers have called for the integration of mindfulness practices into educational settings because of benefits such as enhanced positive emotions, reduced stress, and increased well-being (Robinson, 2004; Rockefeller, 2006; Song and Muschert, 2014). Empirical research on the effectiveness of mindfulness training within communication pedagogical contexts is sparse. The present study takes a step towards filling this gap by applying the broaden-and-build theory to examine the mechanisms by which mindfulness communication helps reduce perceived stress. Specifically, a mixed methods approach is used, combining qualitative journaling with a pretest-posttest experimental design, to understand how a mindfulness-based curriculum enhances positive emotions and improves academic buoyancy for emerging adults in a freshman seminar. Findings suggest that participants in the mindfulness course experienced positive emotions, reported lesser perceived stress, and greater motivation for seeking information about healthy behaviors.

Students from three public Malaysian universities voluntarily participated in a self-administered survey. Results of the path analysis revealed that positive diversity engagement experience and peer civic talk independently have direct influence on civic responsibility development. However, there was no interaction effect between the two predictors. Positive diversity engagement experience was, in turn, affected by amount of engagement in curriculum, co-curriculum, and interaction diversity.

2016-0211,2016,Paper Session,Understanding YouTube Usage for Learning: The Social Cognitive Perspective,3,"The prevalent use of social media has driven educational researchers and practitioners to
investigate the potential of social media to support learning. Among the social media platforms, YouTube is a video-sharing website that has been utilized widely for educational use. Yet, knowledge about factors influencing YouTube usage for learning remains limited. This study thus attempted to understand YouTube usage for learning from the social cognitive perspective, which emphasized the interactions among personal, behavioral, and environmental influences. Specifically, this study drew on the social cognitive perspective to investigate the interactions of learning outcome expectations and attitude towards learning on YouTube (person), the social features of YouTube (environment), and prior experience (behavior) and their influence on the usage of YouTube for learning. A survey was designed and administered to 150 YouTube users. The findings of this study revealed several interactions among personal factors, environment, and behavior. First, it was identified that personal factors, in terms of learning outcome expectations and attitude towards learning on YouTube, predicted YouTube usage for learning (person —> behavior). This study also found that the influence from the environment, in terms of the social features of YouTube, would lead to a positive attitude towards learning on YouTube (environment —> person), while the behavioral influence, in terms of prior experience of learning on YouTube, could have an impact on the learning outcome expectations of using YouTube (behavior —> person). The results also indicated that personal factors could act as mediators. Specifically, attitude towards learning on YouTube mediated the influence of social features of YouTube on YouTube usage for learning, while learning outcome expectations mediate the relationship between the prior experience and YouTube usage for learning.

This paper is part of a larger thesis project which examined the counterfactual narratives lesbians created during their coming out processes with parents. I interviewed ten women about how they predicted their parents would react to their lesbian sexual orientation. While some participants predicted their parents would react positively, a majority of participants had imagined their parents would react negatively upon discovering their sexual orientation. Six different types of upward and downward prefactual narratives were described. Future research possibilities are also explored.

It is unknown what personal characteristics might determine the effect of conflicting coverage on perceptions. It is also unknown whether presentation format would generate different levels of issue uncertainty. There are at least two formats to present the same conflicting information. First, a single news story reporting two conflicting studies. Second, two news stories with each reporting one of the two studies.

With content analytical data from a total of 13 Asian, American, and European countries, we study the stereotypical depiction of males and females in television advertisements. The sample consists of N = 1,755 ads collected in May 2014. Analyzing the gender of the primary character and voiceover, as well as the age, associated product categories, home- or work setting, and the working role of the primary character, we find that gender stereotypes in TV advertising can be found around the world. A multilevel model further shows that gender stereotypes are independent of a country's gender indices such as Hofstede’s Masculinity Index, GLOBE’s Gender Egalitarianism Index, the Gender-related Development Index, the Gender Inequality Index, and the Global Gender Gap Index. These findings suggest that the role of culture in shaping gender stereotypes in television advertising is smaller than commonly thought.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The Effects of Collaboration and Competition Among Players of Human Computation Games,3,"Human Computation Games (HCGs) harness human intelligence through enjoyable gameplay to address computational problems that are beyond the power of computer programs but trivial for humans. With the increased use of HCGs in mobile information sharing, collaboration and competition have emerged as the most commonly used game genres. Yet, there is a dearth of research examining the effects of such genres on players’ perceptions. Thus, this study investigates the effects of collaboration and competition on perceived satisfaction of motivational needs and output quality in mobile content sharing HCGs. Using a within-subjects experiment, 160 participants were recruited from two local universities. The findings suggest that the non-game application was perceived to yield better quality output than both HCGs but the latter offered a greater satisfaction of motivational needs which may, in turn, motivate individuals to continue playing them. Taken together, the present findings inform researchers and designers of HCGs and similar contexts that games could serve as a motivator to encourage participation; however, the usefulness of HCGs may be dependent on how one can effectively manage the entertainment-output generation duality of such games.

2016-0238,2016,Paper Session,The Consequences of One-Way and Two-Way Collaborative Processes in Online Knowledge-Construction Systems,2,"In light of recent developments in content and knowledge generation, we propose the concept of ""one-way collaboration"" to describe processes in which individuals pass their collaborative work from one person to the next rather than engaging in simultaneous discourse with one another. This form of collaboration, which is increasingly exhibited in online environments, offers certain advantages over traditional two-way collaborative interactions that place social pressures and other restrictions upon participants. Collaborative teams may engage in a mixture of one-way and two-way processes, falling along a spectrum between the two dichotomous poles.

However, it also possesses new characteristics that can’t be fully explained by extant collective action theory. First, individuals participate in collaborative knowledge production online for social and hedonic reasons with or without private utility gains. Second, individual participants of collaborative knowledge production make personal decisions that are public and interdependent. Third, online collaborative knowledge production networks are systems with blurred boundaries and little top-down organizational structure. Online collaborative knowledge production is thus a system sustained by collective action of a network of geographically dispersed actors, who voluntarily interact through mediated-communication and self-organized collaboration to produce public knowledge goods. A social network perspective that emphasizes social relations and interactions among potential contributors can complement traditional collective action theory in explaining features of collaborative knowledge production online.",New Opportunities Offered by Media Technologies,Information Systems

Data of the crowdfunders (n=13868) were collected from “Micro Philanthropy”, a popular SNS crowdfunding platform for charity in China. Six types of crowdfunders are identified by the frequency of donating and the amount of money they give in a random donation. SNS profile information such as the number of friends, the social interaction features and the identity of verified users were found to be significantly related to the typology. Active donors and bounteous donors are more influential in absorbing the attention of other SNS users and attracting new donors.",New Opportunities Offered by Media Technologies,Information Systems
2016-0242,2016,Paper Session,Developing a Confluence Model of Rampage Killings: The Cultural Transmission of Despair-Aggress-Suicide Scripts and Guilt as Social Contagion,1,"A confluence model was proposed to explain the effect of life events on aggression and suicide, mediated by personality. The data used to test the proposed model were recorded incidents of rampage killings (N = 400). Causal modeling indicated that Western culture and year of event increased both the use of firearms and subsequent number of deaths, as well as suicide. The results suggest that a despair-aggress-suicide script may be responsible for the link between homicide and suicide; the positive effect of aggression on suicide was slight, as in previous studies. Outcome variables included suicide, killed in the act, and state execution. Verbal aggression from others is posited as social undermining that triggers depression-based physical aggression whereas drug dependence is posited as hindered needs that may trigger neuroticism-based suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.",Processing Social Information,Information Systems

This study aimed to examine the psychological effects of posting/viewing selfies/groupies on social media by conducting a survey (N = 275). Results indicated the more frequently one viewed selfies posted by others, the lower his/her self-esteem. The more frequently one viewed groupies of others, the higher his/her self-esteem. It is also found that frequent groupie-viewing behavior positively associated with life satisfaction whereas frequent selfie-viewing behavior negatively associated with life satisfaction. In addition, people who are in higher need for popularity are more likely to be affected by selfie viewing behavior in terms of life satisfaction and self-esteem compared with people who are in lower need for popularity.",Processing Social Information,Information Systems

To examine viewer’s responses (i.e. attitude toward the post, viral behavioral intention) to exercise post, we used 2 (tie-strength between poster and viewer: high vs. low) x 2 (chance of real-time participation: on vs. off) between-subjects design. The results revealed that viewers showed more favorable attitude toward the post when the poster is an acquaintance, rather than close friend. Moreover, chance of real-time participation and viewer's perceived autonomy while reading the post had an interaction effect on viral behavioral intention (i.e. like, share, comment). The goal of this study is to give a meaningful insight for those who strive to increase viewers’ participation on exercise post in social media, which in turn, would exert positive effects on poster’s motivation to exercise.",Processing Social Information,Information Systems

Meanwhile, research has connected users’ Facebook social capital to their motivations for and intensity of Facebook use. Whether online social capital aids or abets user susceptibility to social media phishing attacks remains unexplored. To ascertain this, the current research simulates a phishing attack on Facebook and examines the extent to which users’ bridging and bonding social capital predicts their likelihood of phishing victimization. Results indicate that users’ bridging social capital in terms of their “network fame,” i.e., the more visible they are and the more sought after they are by others, increases users’ likelihood of victimization. The findings are the first to connect individuals’ online social network characteristics to individual likelihood of deception via phishing.",Processing Social Information,Information Systems

For this purpose, 151 participants commented during two weeks on the White House’s and several other federal agencies’ Facebook and YouTube accounts. It is argued that not all SNS allow the same flow of information, and that different affordances presented in these channels contribute to shape discussion networks, which affects deliberation. Results showed that: 1) deliberation in SNS has a positive effect on collective efficacy; 2) deliberation in the SNS that allows a networked information access (Facebook) caused the highest increase in collective efficacy; 3) cognitive involvement and user engagement satisfactorily explain the increase in collective efficacy; 4) the level of interactivity in the discussion network affects positively users’ engagement.",Processing Social Information,Information Systems
2016-0249,2016,Paper Session,"Self-Control and Need Satisfaction in Primetime: Television, Social Media, and Friends Can Enhance Regulatory Resources via Perceived Autonomy and Competence",3,"The relationship between self-control and using entertainment media has recently been scrutinized. Loss of self-control resources has been linked to using media to procrastinate at work, and generally higher levels of media use. However, this media use could represent either self-regulatory failure, or attempts at restoring self-control. Self-determination theory proposes that satisfying intrinsic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) aids the recovery of self-control. Media use perceived as satisfying autonomy, competence, or relatedness needs has the potential to repair self-control. A two-wave survey (N = 413) measured self-control capacity at the beginning and the end of participants’ evenings, along with their perceptions of leisure activities. Respondents with more self-control capacity before primetime generally experienced more intrinsic need satisfaction during using television, social media, reading, sports, and socializing. Autonomy and competence during television and social media use, and competence during socializing, helped to increase self-control by the end of the evening.",Processing Social Information,Information Systems

Previous scientific studies are mostly focused on factors that motivate (or hinder) knowledge sharing behaviour within such online communities, but little is knows about the consequences of participation. The current study examined employees of a health care organization participating in a VCoP. We applied self-determination theory to investigate motivations to share knowledge within the VCoP by assessing perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness within the online community, and consequences of online participation by measuring perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness at work, and job satisfaction. Results showed that feelings of competence within the VCoP were positively related to online knowledge sharing behavior. Furthermore, employees felt more competent and autonomous in performing their job, more related to colleagues, and more satisfied in their work due to online VCoP participation.",Online Communities and Media Technologies,Information Systems

The current study is an examination of what predicts public mourning behavior online and offline, through the context of the passing of Singapore's founding father, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Among the antecedents explored were traditional media exposure and social media exposure, and their influence on face-to-face interactions, grief, and mourning behavior. Results showed that both traditional media and social media have significant predictive power on public's interpersonal interactions, grief, and mourning behavior toward Mr. Lee's passing.

Additionally, there is reason to think that that playing a video game with a sexualized female avatar may affect the player differently than simply watching the videogame with the same character. Specifically, interactive performance may increase the likelihood that the content will affect the player. Finally, exposure to sexualized female avatars under conditions of cognitive load may influence the extent to which players are affected by the portrayal. The current study examined how all three variables (sexualization, interactivity, and cognitive load) affect attitudes toward women. A total of 300 undergraduate students participated in a 2 (manipulated cognitive capacity: load, no load) X 2 (characters: sexualized, non-sexualized) X 2 (interactivity: watch, play) between subjects experiment.

I chronicle the respective mobilization efforts of both world wars, focusing on the activities and implications of film stars in their off-screen roles as patriotic citizens. Such war work represented a new manner of linking state power with popular culture to regulate national identity.

Yet, unsympathetic public opinion, intensifying policing and surveillance, as well as unfavorable court rulings privileging property over speech block the possible spatial structural transformation.

In mass communications the focus on gender and ethnic diversity issues has led to research and debates on equity and equality in media content and employment. In public relations gender issues include iniquities in salaries and promotion, work-life balance and career opportunities beyond technical positions for women. In spite of the public relations field being female-dominated, these issues have not been adequately addressed in education or practice. The goal of this study is to examine students’ perspectives on the gender issues in the public relations. Data were gathered with a survey (N=417) of students enrolled in mass communication courses at a large Mid-Western University. Key determinants of gender perceptions include age, sex and their perceptions of ethnicity in public relations.

However, this seems to be changing. This paper accounts for the popularity of Big Freedia, a black, gay, gender nonconforming male hip hop artist. Via a close textual analysis of her live performances, music videos, and reality television show, we map out how she negotiates the specificities of her identity in her performances in order to offer ‘pathways of seeing’ to diverse audiences across race, place, gender, and sexuality. We argue Big Freedia’s popularity emerges from a tricky, yet commercially successful, balance of queer cultural disruption and “gaystreaming” (Ng, 2013).",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Nevertheless, since 2008 female celebrities/girl characters have anchored several of the top-ten highest grossing franchises of all time, including Twilight, Hunger Games, and Disney Princess films (with Divergent on its way up.) Additionally, young female celebrities now play a significant role in marketing even male-dominate franchises (e.g., Emma Stone in Spider-man and Jennifer Lawrence in X-Men). This paper examines young female stars' new centrality as female franchise celebrities and explores the transformation of gender in franchise culture. I argue that with the huge success of girl film franchises and the emergence of a new kind of franchise celebrity structured around girls/young women, it appears that the franchise form has found a way to expand, to incorporate (feminine) celebrity and thereby develop an even wider reach in a transmedia environment.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Using a large scale quantitative content analysis (n = 3,909), the current study investigates whether tabloid, broadsheet, regional and financial newspapers differ in their use of seven news factors. The results suggest that tabloid newspapers, just as regional newspapers, particularly rely on factors of personification and negativity. The news factor geographical proximity is of the strongest importance for regional newspapers and of least relevance for financial newspapers, which by contrast focus on the factor of facticity. Broadsheets, furthermore, tend to employ a very general pattern of news factor use.

We employed quantitative content analysis on items from five participatory journalism projects that differed in the level of control hold by professional journalists, to examine how these manifest themselves on ‘objectivity’ and ‘diversity’. Results demonstrate that ‘professional control’ is a meaningful concept to interpret differences between participatory journalistic environments regarding objectivity and diversity. Reporting style was found to be more subjective with weaker professional control, and topic diversity increased. Diversity of sources and news values did not increase with a weakening of professional control, but participants did place different emphases regarding source use and news values when they had more freedom.

The majority of the other salient type of firms had a significant positive impact on diversity. These results suggest that banks attracted attention at the expense of more varied, diverse coverage during the crisis. Our findings extend knowledge of agenda-setting dynamics in relation to company news by considering characteristics of the broader media agenda.

The results show that the “new media” discourse demonstrated a trend of rise and became another dominant discourse besides the “ideal” discourse. The production of the ""ideal"" discourse lies in the dichotomy of “ideal” and “reality”, as well as the conflict between ""past"" and ""present"". Collective memories of the Republican China, 1980s, and “golden age” of Chinese journalism industry, as well as personal experiences are strategically utilized as symbolic resources to produce the myth of “ideal”. On the other hand, the ""new media"" discourse mainly relies on the dichotomy of ""new media"" and ""traditional media"", as well as on the tension between “future” and “present”. Journalists strategically construct the myth of ""new media"" or ""traditional media"" based on their senses of positions in the journalistic field to legitimate their choices over career change.

We used content analysis to explore how journalists working for German-language media cover this phenomenon. Based on a typology of online firestorms we find that the majority of cases address events of perceived moral misconduct. Vilification of an organization or person appeared in a much smaller number of covered firestorms.

Scholars have argued that simulacra experience should be discriminated from that of photography. This research aims to object it by adopting theories of Barthes and Deleuze. Barthes’s concept of punctum explicates the distinctive sensation a viewer achieves from an encounter with a photograph. This research proposes that a feeling equivalent to punctum can be sensed in simulacra experience. In order to define it, this research traces the phenomenological influences on Barthes’s works and re-reads punctum, concentrating on the conditions of noeme and l’air. Simultaneously, Deleuzian concept of affect is introduced as a modality for understanding human interactions with simulacra image. Adopting Deleuzian interpretation, the virtuality of l’air is illuminated as it is an essence within actuality. From Deleuzian reading on self-referential characteristic of simulacra, this research reveals that simulacra have no difference from photography. Ergo, this research discovers a sensation that encompasses both facets of punctum and affect, proposing it as ‘Punctum-Affect’.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This essay elucidates both narrative transportation and character identification, and raises a proposition to clarify the ambiguity in the field. First, existing literature is used to develop conceptual and operational definitions for narrative transportation and identification. Second, an inside/outside story perspective in understanding involvement constructs is proposed as opposed to a narrative/character involvement distinction. Lastly, a higher-order concept termed “narrative experience” is proposed and explicated.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In other words, media may allow one to cultivate a cosmopolitan capital. However, far from everyone is recognizing this potential. This study argues that cos-mopolitan ‘readings’ of the contemporary media landscape should be understood in relation to cultural capital. Analyses from a national survey and in-depth interviews, conducted in Sweden, disclose a tendency among those in possession of cultural capital to recognize and exploit cos-mopolitan capital in their media practices. Those in dispossession of cultural capital are signifi-cantly less prone to approach the media in this way. Relying on various media practices in order to exchange one capital for another exemplifies what Bourdieu called reconversion strategies. As social fields become more global, media offer opportunities for those occupying positions of rela-tive (cultural) privilege to remain privileged – to change in order to conserve.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

We draw upon our research in two different projects involving observation of political talk to do so. We observe that people give preferential treatment to personal experience. Our results suggest that facts usually used to test political knowledge may not be most appropriate for gauging civic competence.

Identified as circular reasoning and connoting objections as incoherent, the myth presented in ‘coherence’ is rejected as a legitimate defense for democratic decision-making. This communication frame morally preempts critical thinking and thereby makes specific types of critical public engagement taboo. The reliance on myth demonstrates how power makers distance their selves from those they govern as reasonable objections to policies are confined by the scope of the stated rational.

2016-0309,2016,Paper Session,Influencing the News Through Social Media: Online Agenda Building and Normalization During a Pre-Electoral Campaign Period,6,"Despite the hopes of increasing participation and political use of online media existing power positions seem to influence the visibility of actors online; i.e. the online space is normalized. Here, the question of normalization is combined with the perspectives of agenda-setting and agenda-building. To investigate how existing political power positions and resources influence the online agenda we collected candidates’ social media updates from Twitter and Facebook, citizen discussions from Twitter, and news data from major newspapers before the Finnish 2015 Parliamentary Election. Using computational data analysis, topic modelling and regression analysis we build a model to measure and explain the candidates’ influence over agenda in both social and news media. We show topical differences between media and mixed evidence regarding normalization, but our findings imply that social media is more normalized than traditional media. Further, overall activity of the candidate in social media predicts influence in both media.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

It examines whether the public has strong will to support or oppose the Michigan Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was being considered by the Senate. The results show that although the majority (69.8%) opposes the bill, it does not have strong will to oppose it. Respondents (both who support and oppose the bill) were not willing to sacrifice to support their position. The level of determination and perseverance was also quite low. Issue fervor and cognitive accessibility (which are attributes of attitude strength), self-efficacy, perception of others’ willingness to act strongly predicted willingness to act (R = .74).",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The results demonstrated support for a social influence model derived from attribution theory, wherein negative ads did, in fact, influence poll results. And presidential candidates competed in characteristic ways when loading attack ads, as spending on negative advertising against Romney predicted spending on advertising attacking Obama in about one month at Lag 3 and Lag 4. Furthermore, the presumed bias inherent to certain public opinion polls influenced poll results, such that liberally biased polls increased support for Obama.

Two experiments were conducted to examine the potential of ambivalence to reduce such perceptions of bias so as to ameliorate individuals’ deliberation preparedness. Results show that, across different issues, the naïve realistic perceptual tendency is tenacious. Importantly, ambivalence carries the potential to rectify the naïve realistic perceptions of bias. Regardless of the forms in which self-other incongruence takes shape, the general pattern with regard to the moderating property of ambivalence is that ambivalence toward elective abortion consistently mitigated the impact of incongruence on individuals’ perceptions of bias in their prospective deliberation partner.

Goffman (1976) theorizes that people get caught dodging questions when they violate the flow of a question-answer sequence. Ironic process theory (Wegner, 1997) predicts that overtly dodging a question would cause increased rumination over the question. Truth-default theory (Levine, 2014) points to the power of suspicion in delineating whether or not people are perceived as dodging. We measured these predicted effects. We created experimental stimuli of a political interview. In support of Grice and Goffman, an overt refusal to answer was perceived as dodging and slight differences were noticed between on- and off-topic answers. In support of ironic process theory, an overt refusal to answer caused rumination.

Bloggers, Youtubers and Instagram stars, armed with their laptops and smart phones, represent an important part of the contemporary media landscape. This chapter will take a look at Singaporean Blogger Wendy Cheng who goes by the pseudonym Xiaxue. Starting her blogging career in 2003 as one of Singapore’s first celebrity bloggers, Xiaxue has built a massive online presence that now includes desktop and mobile blogging platforms, video platforms and social media. With a 6-figure multinational following on all her social media platforms, frequent public appearances and substantial corporate sponsorships, she is arguably one of, if not the most, commercially successful DIY celebrity in her country. Her thriving blogging career indicates a sizable fan base. However, we will look at the other end of the spectrum - the anti-fans, or haters – an often-neglected segment in audience and reception studies. Apart from being famous, Xiaxue is also infamous. Her liberal use of digital photo editing, straightforward personality and “no holds barred” style of communication, among other reasons, have made her a target for haters. These anti-fans, people who strongly dislike Xiaxue, can be just as engaged and organised as fans, albeit in different ways. Their actions against Xiaxue range from online flaming, to entire forum boards dedicated to loathing her. Using user comments on Xiaxue’s online video channel Xiaxue’s Guide to Life, and anti-fan platform Guru Gossip’s Abhorred Bloggers (Xiaxue) forum as texts, this chapter will analyze how anti-fans read and construct the image of this celebrity blogger. Findings show that her anti-fandom is driven by a moral economy related to her self-presentation, femininity and nature of her celebrity.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

We propose that the motives and rituals of binge-watchers can be used to expand uses and gratifications (U&G) theory. We conducted qualitative audience interviews to understand how and why people binge-watch, and how they feel about binge-watching. The findings indicate that 1) audiences’ motivations for binge-watching are: catching up, relaxation, sense of completion, cultural inclusion, and improved viewing experience; 2) the portability and navigability of streaming video technology influence binge-watching rituals; and 3) audiences are ambivalent about their binge-watching. We propose that a viewer attentiveness spectrum (VAS) is a more accurate descriptor of contemporary TV watching than the passive/active dichotomy. We further argue that the changing motives and rituals of TV audiences can be used to bolster the quantitative surveys often employed in U&G research and to address the lingering criticisms of U&G theory.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In this article, we engage in a discussion about the symbolic functions of humor for members of co-cultural groups, particularly Spanish gay youth. We approach this discussion through a rhetorical analysis of the five most popular videos that Spanish Queens shared by in 2012 and 2013. Spanish Queens is a collaborative YouTube channel where LGBTQ youth from diverse parts of the country share their experiences, thoughts, and opinions about being queer in Spain. SQ video bloggers (“vloggers” hereto) often used verbal and tonal cues to emphasize the humorous nature of their videos. The main verbal cue was a disclaimer- sometimes also presented in writing- warning audiences that what vloggers said in their videos was not to be taken seriously. When not stated explicitly, humorous disclaimers often through alteration of vlogger’s voice.
Vloggers often used double speech to address, and sometimes challenge: 1) Stereotypes, often by repeating them; and 2) Exclusionary and marginalizing discourses by calling them out. The use of double speech, however, does not seem to come without a cost. In the case of SQ videos, challenging stereotypes and dominant discourses not only poses the threat of perpetuating those addressed, but, the discourse in SQ videos also often reaffirms other stereotypes and normative ideas of gender and, sometimes as a consequence, further exclude certain members of the community.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A Reading of Sexual and Nonsexual Objectification in Preteen-Popular TV Shows,2,"Analyzing objectifying narratives of a number of prime time television shows popular with preteens, this paper redresses the reduction of objectification to sexual objectification. Results show that non-sexual objectification is much more prevalent than sexual objectification. Additionally, rather than existing in a binary, many objectifying acts fall somewhere on a continuum between the sexual and the non-sexual. Opening up the research perspective to include non-sexual objectification creates room to interpret more subtle forms of objectification that have a gendered undercurrent. Finally, it is shown that context is key in studying objectification in media content. Narratives can either maintain gendered power imbalances through the continued, banal use of male-on-female objectification as a plot device, or deconstruct them by explicitly contextualizing objectification as a problem, leaving very different impressions for the viewer.

This preliminary study analyzes 15 manga with 17 self-injuring characters published between 2000-2015 to interrogate how NSSI experiences are portrayed. Findings indicate that NSSI characters closely reflect stereotypical perception of the “self-injurer” as a young female wrist-cutter. For many of these characters, NSSI serves as a coping mechanism to alleviate negative emotion or overcome dissociation. Yet, we also identify an emergent trend among recent manga for male readers to label women who self-injure as “menhera,” mentally unstable and attractive young girls.

Abstract

Attitudes toward objects and persons are often measured using the summative model (Fishbein, 1967). The model holds that a person’s attitude (A) can be calculated from the formula, A = ∑ (b * e), where b = the perceived likelihood a belief is true and e = the evaluation of a belief. How variations in belief accessibility affect the attitude is not fully understood. In the current study, participants listed their beliefs about one of three candidates in the 2008 presidential election. Contrary to hypothesis, the ability of the summative model to predict an independent measure of attitude toward the candidate was not improved by taking into account the frequency (f) with which each listed belief was thought about. The study also asked whether beliefs listed early in the list or last in the list were stronger predictors of an independent measure of attitude toward the candidate.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

To test the hypothesis, participants conducted a speeded categorization task (“I like” or “I don’t like”) on 75 images that contained varying ratios of positive/negative emotional content, ranging from completely positive to more positive than negative, equally positive and negative, more negative than positive, and completely negative. Each valence combination contained food and non-food images. Equally positive and negative images were categorized the slowest mimicking a ""freeze"" effect described in the defense cascade model. Images with primary motivators were categorized faster than images with secondary motivators. These findings support our hypothesis of implicit attitudes as expressions of directional motivated behavioral response.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

Based on the dynamic human-centered communication system theory, implicit measures of attitude assess the initial motivational activation elicited by an object, and explicit attitude measures assess an attitude that incorporates the initial motivational activation with the later on deliberative processing. The current study proposes that when the motivational relevance of an object is strong, the elicited motivational activation will be hard for conscious brain to suppress. Therefore, people should have more consistent explicit and implicit attitudes towards the object with high motivational relevance. The hypothesis is tested and supported in the current study design. The implications of the result for persuasion studies are discussed.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

More importantly, information seeking completely mediated the effects of perceived susceptibility and anxiety on an increase in response- and self-efficacy, and a decrease in message rejection. Information seeking also partially mediated the effects of perceived susceptibility and fear on an increase in message acceptance.",Risk Information and Risk Behaviors,Information Systems
2016-0343,2016,Paper Session,Predicting Information Seeking in the Context of Earthquake Risk: Development of a Cognitive Model,2,"This study focuses on the prediction of risk information seeking in the context of earthquake risk. A path model is developed to learn the knowledge of individuals’ cognitive processing of earthquake risk information. The model includes perceived information quality, subjective knowledge, earthquake risk perception, and outcome expectation as potential predictors of the intention of risk information seeking. To test the proposed model, this study uses data collected from a sample of 1032 Chinese regarding their opinions on earthquake risk, a major natural threat to China that causes public concerns. Results of the analyses under the structural equation modeling framework supported the predictive power of the model. Outcome expectation is supported as the direct significant predictor of the behavioral variable. Compared with previous models, the cognitive model in this study provides a more parsimonious explanation of risk information seeking by highlighting the role of outcome expectation and its contributors.",Risk Information and Risk Behaviors,Information Systems
2016-0344,2016,Paper Session,"Sensationalizing Epidemic Outbreaks: Illuminating the Interplay of Actual Risk, Factual Risk Information, and Sensational Formal Features",1,"A principal concern and criticism about the coverage of epidemic outbreaks is its contribution to unwarranted fears, heightened risk perception and irrational behaviors through emotion-laden reporting or news sensationalism. Prior studies on news sensationalism demonstrated that sensational formal features increase risk perceptions. Yet, the independent and combined effects of sensationalist form with different disease characteristics and types of factual risk information remain unexplored. To investigate this, we conducted a 2 (severity: high/low) x 2 (vulnerability: high/low) x 2 form (factual/sensationalist) experiment on a representative sample of 1604 participants. News effects on risk perception, negative affective (e.g., fear), behavioral intentions, and evaluation of news quality were investigated. Data collection was finalized Oct, 30; data analysis will employ a series of 3-way ANOVAs. Beyond the theoretical contribution – a differentiation of the concept of news sensationalism – the questions addressed here have implications for the performance of journalism’s societal role and health crises management.",Risk Information and Risk Behaviors,Information Systems

A psychological account for this idea is lacking. We present experimental data in support of the hypothesis that anticipation of economic changes impacts individuals’ risk-taking choices, prior to any realized changes. Using a within-subjects design, messages about possible changes in riskiness of future trials during a known decision-making game (BART task) had a direct effect on risky choices of participants (N = 40), in the absence of any actual changes. Post-hoc testing suggested a stronger effect size for negative messages compared to positive. Analyses of reaction times indicated differences in behavioral performance, with negative anticipation eliciting slower reaction times for making increasingly riskier decisions. We discuss the psychological concept of anticipation next to the idea that economic news can impact individuals’ economic choices that, taken together as a whole, can result in financial bursts.",Risk Information and Risk Behaviors,Information Systems

To get a clearer direction on elevating the quality of cancer information service, the public’s cancer information seeking behaviors need to be better investigated. To better understand individual’s choice of cancer information seeking behaviors, a preliminary analysis with the database of HINTS was conducted. Based upon the Theory of Planned Behavior as the theoretical framework, the findings of a logistic regression revealed several behavioral beliefs and self-efficacy as significant predictors of individual’s cancer information seeking behaviors. This empirical evidence from the national-wide survey highlights the significance of beliefs on individual’s cancer information seeking choice, and requires further research on understanding the influence of behavioral beliefs on people’s information seeking patterns and utilizing the identified promising message strategies for cancer-related information dissemination.",Risk Information and Risk Behaviors,Information Systems

Drawing on the affect infusion model and on affective disposition theory, three hypotheses were tested in an experiment with a non-student sample. The affective disposition was manipulated via newspaper articles about one of the talk show guests. Results suggest that viewers’ affective disposition toward this guest remained stable during exposure to the program, leading to predetermined information processing of the discussed political issue. As a consequence, viewers were found to form an attitude which is consistent with the one held by the guest. Without prior affective disposition toward the guest affective involvement with the political issue under discussion influenced the viewers’ attitudes instead, indicating open information processing.

2016-0351,2016,Paper Session,(Unintended) Effects of Pop Culture References on the Perception of Politicians,3,"Politicians use pop culture references to shape their public image, showing potential voters that they are one of them. While this strategy may increase their likeability, research suggests that an increase on this dimension is often accompanied by a decrease in perceived competence. A possible strategy to counteract this “innuendo effect” might be to use pop culture references that explicitly include a political context, thus addressing the competence dimension as well. The present study tested this assumption by conducting an online experiment in which participants read an interview with a politician who claimed to watch a popular TV series, either stressing a political context or not. Results showed that the politician was indeed perceived more likeable and less competent when referring to an up-to-date TV series without a political context; however, referring to a political series can counteract this effect to some extent.",Processing Political and News Information in an Age of Entertainment and Overload,Information Systems

Time Affluence, Information-Related Self-Efficacy, and Need for Cognition as Predictors of Political Media Use and Political Knowledge",5,"The present study examined whether the perceived complexity of political issues is related to individuals’ political media use and political knowledge. Further, we investigated the respective role of three key psychological predictors under low and high perceived complexity: time affluence, information-related self-efficacy (i.e., information-seeking self-efficacy and epistemic self-efficacy), and need for cognition. Findings are based on an online survey with 1,082 German residents. Perceived complexity was weakly associated with political knowledge and not related to political media use. However, time affluence was positively related to political knowledge and this relationship was mediated by political media use. Similarly, information seeking self-efficacy predicted political knowledge through an increase in political media use. Moreover, we found a small positive relationship between need for cognition and political knowledge. The perceived complexity of politics weakly moderated the relationship between time affluence and political media use. We discuss theoretical and practical implications and future research directions.",Processing Political and News Information in an Age of Entertainment and Overload,Information Systems

The difficulty to evaluate and select relevant information increases as more and diverse sources and content are available. Information overload (IO) may be the consequence. The research presented here gives a first comprehensive overview of possible indicators for IO in the context of online news exposure. Based on an online survey we found that besides socio-demographics, less information-seeking efficacy and presumably normatively driven information retrieval proved to be critical factors for a higher amount of IO. Additional-ly, we identified some information retrieval strategies that imply IO. With our results, we con-tribute to a further understanding of IO and provide an important basis for future research needed to face the challenges resulting from the rising media diversity.",Processing Political and News Information in an Age of Entertainment and Overload,Information Systems

Exploring Effects of Online News Structure on Information Processing,2,The primary goal of this paper is to investigate how the structure of on-line news stories affects how efficiently the news stories are processed. Specifically it focuses on how two types of news writing structures – inverted pyramid and news narrative – affect time spent reading and memory for news stories. A total of 210 participants browsed a website containing eight news stories until they finished reading each news story. Time spent viewing each story was recorded. Participants were then asked to recall as many online stories as they could remember. Preliminary analyses revealed that participants spent less time reading stories with inverted pyramid structure yet remembered these stories better than stories with news narrative structure.,Processing Political and News Information in an Age of Entertainment and Overload,Information Systems

The temporal and spatial characteristics of the Internet have accelerated repetitive publishing of almost identical news content with different headlines in order to attract online traffic. Based on a nationwide survey involving 1,000 citizens, we found a statistically significant association of repetitive news with age, education, motives for using portals, and reliance on portals for news. We also found that, through hierarchical regression analyses, repetitive news block was the strongest and negative predictor of the press and portal credibility. The more frequently one was exposed to repetitive news and the more seriously one perceived it as being problematic, the less likely they were to regard the press and portals as credible. These results have implications for online news flow and credibility research.",Processing Political and News Information in an Age of Entertainment and Overload,Information Systems

We employ an innovative analytical approach to construct network maps of digital news use. These “digital news usage networks”, when constructed separately for different age groups, reveal to what extent young people’s news usage on the Internet differs from older generations that were socialized into the pre-digital media environment. Ultimately, this study contributes to the knowledge on digital citizenship by addressing the heated issue of how young adults get news online through our use of high-quality data, an improved methodology, and a novel analytical approach.",Processing Political and News Information in an Age of Entertainment and Overload,Information Systems
2016-0357,2016,Paper Session,Permanently Online and Permanently Procrastinating? The Mediating Role of Internet Use for the Effects of Trait Procrastination on Psychological Well-Being,9,"Initial evidence suggests that online media are frequently used, but psychologically detrimental ‘tools for procrastination’. The present study thus investigated the relationship between trait procrastination, Internet use, and psychological well-being in a representative sample of N = 1,577 German Internet Users. The results revealed that trait procrastination was associated with an increased use of entertaining online content as well as impaired control over Internet use. As a result, individuals high in trait procrastination showed a higher risk of experiencing negative consequence of Internet use in other life domains. These negative repercussions of insufficiently self-regulated Internet use partially accounted for the detrimental effects of trait procrastination on stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings clearly underline the role of Internet use as an instrument for dysfunctional task delay. The implications of the results are discussed with regard to research on media use and self-control in general and procrastinatory media use in specific.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

However, there are only few and contradictory scientific findings about the users’ well-being in the context of smartphone use. The most popular applications are instant messengers (IM). Our study aims to understand under which conditions IM is related to stress. Based on Self-Determination Theory, we assumed that an autonomous motivation to use IM is associated with less stress. Furthermore, inferred from research on the relationship of mindfulness with well-being, we suspected a negative relationship between mindfulness during IM and stress. Finally, we hypothesized that a day-specific mindfulness might indirectly reduce stress by empowering people to use their devices more autonomously. We conducted a diary study with 211 participants who answered 868 short questionnaires on five consecutive days. The results of regression analyses supported our assumptions.

Using structural equation modeling, we tested a two-step model that investigates (1) the extent to which adolescents’ need to belong and need for popularity were associated with an increased Facebook use, through fear of missing out and (2) the extent to which adolescents’ fear of missing out was associated with increased stress related to Facebook use, through an increased Facebook use. Adolescents (N = 402) completed paper-and-pencil surveys. Results indicated that adolescents’ need to belong and need for popularity were associated with an increased Facebook use through an increased fear of missing out. Fear of missing out, in turn, was associated with increased stress related to Facebook use through Facebook use.

However, little is known about whether app users are aware of and concerned about the data collection and usage practices of apps, whether they perceive themselves able to protect their privacy, and whether they actually engage in privacy protection. This study assesses app users’ current status of privacy knowledge, concerns, self-efficacy, and protection behavior, by surveying 1.593 app users about the 12 most popular mobile apps in a Western European country. The results demonstrated that app users know little about the data collection and usage practices of apps and that they are not very concerned about their privacy. Moreover, app users did not feel able to protect their privacy in apps and they did not engage much in privacy protection. Comparisons between apps and between differently concerned users showed that levels of privacy knowledge, concern, self-efficacy, and protection behavior may vary per app and per privacy-concerned segment.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

Yet, it is still unclear how they assess the security of online systems and reveal their private information online. Some scholars presume that users carefully evaluate the benefits and risks of information disclosure, following a “privacy calculus.” However, other scholars question this proposition and claim that users are driven by cues in the interaction context, which trigger cognitive heuristics about the safety and security of specific online transactions. This study examines 18 potential heuristics via a scenario-based survey of a representative sample of US nationals (N=786) in order to identify those that most strongly predict online information disclosure. First-cut analyses of data reveal that heuristics relating to sense of community and self-presentation promote disclosure whereas those pertaining to mobility inhibit disclosure.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

Building on exemplification theory, social comparison theory, and the intersectionality hypothesis, the current study investigates if exemplar characteristics alter recipients’ general stigma-related attitudes towards individuals with a disability, and examines the role of recipient characteristics as moderators of the proposed relationships. Respondents read an article about an individual with a disability before completing a questionnaire that assessed five facets of stigmatization. Articles were manipulated regarding the gender, type of disability, immigration background, and sexual orientation of the depicted exemplar. Results support the assumption that exemplar characteristics affect readers’ general attitudes towards social groups, and that recipient variables play an important role in this process.

Political texts (whether a political speech, a news column, or a press-release) vary in their use of language. The variation is not simply in content, but also in the structure of language. Recent studies found that e.g., newspapers differ in linguistic complexity across genres, or that the complexity of political texts decrease with time. Previous research has shown that political text complexity has a direct impact on the ability to process and acquire political information, and therefore on the politics as a whole.

2016-0370,2016,Paper Session,Towards a Preliminary Self-Report Measure of Cognitive Dissonance for Communication Research,2,"Individuals’ motivation for information selection and processing alters after making a decision (Fischer & Greitemeyer, 2010). Drawing on cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957; Festinger, 1964), individuals may experience cognitive dissonance after they make an important decision. Cognitive dissonance leads to the re-appraisal of both attitudes and behavior (e.g., previous decision), and possible reversal of behavior through regret (Das & Kerr, 2010). Accordingly, communication messages differ in their effect depending on whether they were received pre-decisionally versus post-decisionally. This study empirically validates a preliminary measure of cognitive dissonance for the purpose of communication research. Based on factor analysis (N = 204), the proposed shortened scale synthesizes six multidimensional measures from extent literature in psychology, advertising, and consumer behavior. The short form validated the test-retest reliability after participants selected messages in an experimental context designed to induce cognitive dissonance. The scale has clear applications in the field to identify the extent to which individuals may select messages differentially as a result of experiencing cognitive dissonance after a decision.",Innovative Approaches and New Measures,Information Systems

First, we explored people’s viewing behavior while multiscreening by means of an eye-tracker. Second, we examined people’s reporting of attention, by comparing eye-tracker and self-reported measures of attention. Third, we assessed the effects of multiscreening on people’s memory, by comparing people’s memory for editorial and advertising content when multiscreening (TV/tablet) versus single screening. The results of the experiment (N = 177) show that 1) people switched between screens 2.5 times per minute, with longer average and total gaze durations on TV, 2) people were well capable of reporting their own attention, and 3) multiscreeners remembered content just as well as single screeners, when they devoted sufficient attention to the content. Additionally, the outcomes of different instructions in the multiscreening conditions were compared to assess the ecological validity of the results.",Attention and Divided Attention,Information Systems
2016-0379,2016,Paper Session,A Watched Pot Never Boils During Multitasking,2,"A total of 56 undergraduate students were assigned randomly to one of three levels of interruptions when performing a worst-case scenario task: low (2 emails + 2 iPad messages), medium (5 emails + 5 iPad messages) and high (8 emails + 8 iPad). Participants in high- switching condition estimated significantly shorter duration than participants in the low and medium conditions. However, the difference between the low and medium conditions was not significant. Though the low, medium and high task-switching conditions did not yield the expected linear pattern, differences between the low and high conditions offers partial evidence that duration decreases when task-switching increases.",Attention and Divided Attention,Information Systems
2016-0380,2016,Paper Session,Developing and Validating an Unobtrusive and Online Measure of the Attentional Component of Flow,4,"Little is known about the cognitive processes that result in flow. This may be due to ambiguities in conceptualizing flow and an over reliance on self-report measures. In three experimental studies, we seek to overcome these issues by developing and validating the use of secondary task response times as an unobtrusive and real-time measure of the attentional component of flow experiences. Framed by assumptions central to the synchronization theory of flow, and consistent with theoretical predictions based on a limited capacity model of attention, our results show that response times are longest under the condition of flow compared to boredom and frustration. This finding indicates that flow experiences during media exposure are characterized by a process of highly focused attention. Implications for the future development and application of flow theory in media research are discussed.",Attention and Divided Attention,Information Systems
2016-0381,2016,Paper Session,Self and Stories: The Implicit Nature of Identification,1,"The impact of narratives in their ability to persuade, educate, and shape our self-perceptions has long been central for many communication scholars. One of the ways that narratives influence us is through identification with story characters by simulating their traits and goals. The primary aim of this experimental research is to better understand this identification processes. By using two different stories, we provide evidence whether exposure to narratives can lead to an automatic increase in the activation of character traits (implicit identification measured via an Identity IAT) in the mind of the recipient, and specifically, whether exposure to a narrative can cause temporally changes in the explicit self-views. The moderating effects of transportation and counter arguing are further contributions of this research.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems
2016-0382,2016,Paper Session,An Application of the Dual Coding Landscape Model of Comprehension to Full-Length Feature Films,3,"The landscape model provides a framework for predicting an audience’s memory for a text by investigating the integration of existing knowledge and new information into a coherent situation model. Previous research has tested the landscape model with reading, factual stories, and short audiovisual entertainment and news clips. This study applied the landscape model to a full-length feature film. The landscape model explained 34% of the variance in recall of the events in the film. The more recent dual coding version of the landscape model, which assumes separate verbal and visual representations of the story, explained 43% of the variance in memory. Finally, this study explored the integration of the landscape model and the event-indexing model for a full-length film. The event-indexing model dimensions were not found to be significant moderators between the landscape model and participant memory; future research on event segmentation is discussed.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems
2016-0383,2016,Paper Session,Findings From a Longitudinal Experiment Examining the Impact of Romantic Films on Romantic Beliefs,5,"Although the effects of media consumption have been examined within a variety of contexts (e.g., news media, violent media), the effects of viewing romantic media on individuals’ beliefs about real-life romantic relationships has received little attention. Using a longitudinal design, the current study examined whether experimentally manipulated exposure to romantic media content influenced one’s beliefs about romance using a longitudinal experimental design. Results indicate that exposure to romantic films affected endorsement of romantic beliefs over time with the effects being strongest for individuals in the high romantic film condition. Additionally, our results indicate that romantic film exposure did not have a “spreading activation” on other relational variables (i.e., relational expectations), and thus are unlikely to be attributed to demand characteristics. These findings are integrated into the current body of literature on media effects and attitude change resulting from media consumption, and the implications of these findings are discussed.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems
2016-0384,2016,Paper Session,Memories From a Binger: An Experimental Investigation of Viewing Experience and the Impact on Product Placement Recall,1,"This study seeks to investigate whether viewing type (binge watching 3 episodes of 30-Rock in a row or watching one episode at a time for three weeks) will impact memory of product placements. Based on our overarching research question, the researchers expect to provide results on whether memory is better for product placements after binging or traditional viewing. Type of placement is predicted to affect memory, as well, where audio, no visual and low congruency to plot will be best remembered followed by visual, audio and high congruency with plotline and finally, the visual, not mentioned and low congruency with the plotline. We also query whether enjoyment of the show, in general, moderates the relationship between viewing condition and memory of product placement.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems
2016-0385,2016,Paper Session,Adopting the Sexual Gaze: Exposure to Sexually Objectifying Music Videos and Visual Attention Toward Women,4,"The current study aimed to investigate the effect of exposure to sexually objectifying music videos on viewers’ subsequent gaze patterns. Participants (N = 116; 63 women, 53 men) were either exposed to music videos high in sexual objectification or low in sexual objectification. Afterwards, participants’ eye movements were measured while viewing images of 36 females with varying degrees of body shape (i.e., ideal size model, plus size model) and degree of dress (i.e., fully dressed, scantly dressed, partially clad). Our findings suggest that sexually objectifying music videos increase the sexual gaze among women, but not among men. Thus, women who were primed with sexually objectifying imagery absorbed the presented gaze pattern and looked more on female bodies than on female faces. This effect was independent from the body shape and the degree of dress. This suggests that all kinds of women may be targeted by visual sexual objectification.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems
2016-0386,2016,Paper Session,Do Lyrics of Pop Songs Matter for Message Processing?,3,"Previous research has shown that pros-social song lyrics increase helping behavior for low-dangerous situations through identification. The present study wants extend this research by 1) analyzing effects of pro-social lyrics on helping behavior in moral courageous situations, 2) investigating the effect of pro-social lyrics on helping behavior in different conditions of follow-up, bystander addressed persuasive messages, and 3) clarifying the causal decision processes by which pro-social music exposure affects bystander interventions in moral courage situations. The study employed a 2 (pro-social versus neutral song) x 2 (testimonial versus objective message), between-subjects factorial experimental design. Pro-social song lyrics significantly decreased anti-social thoughts compared to neutral lyrics but cognitive thoughts are unrelated to any of the bystander decision variables. In line the general learning model and decision processes of bystander decisions, pro-social music directly increased responsibility perceptions. Identification and emergency awareness mediate the influence of testimonial-based persuasive messages on responsibility.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems
2016-0387,2016,Paper Session,It's No Game: Testing if Generative Music Systems in Video Games Increase Flow in Players,1,"Flow is “the optimal experience"" and originally proposed by Csíkszentmihályi. It is a pleasant state of deep concentration where the outer world melts away and a person focuses intently on the task at hand. When a person is in flow they are only able to focus intently on the task at hand when the difficulty of the task is closely paired with their ability. This means a person is always challenged, but also able to succeed. Although Csíkszentmihályi initially used flow to describe the pleasurable deep concentration observed in painters and sculptors, subsequent research reports people experiencing flow while doing a wide range of hobbies, from chess to rock climbing. People have also reported experiencing flow while using video games or listening to music. The study combines these two media sources to see if the musical soundtrack in games influences the sense of flow players experience while playing them.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems
2016-0388,2016,Paper Session,Do Attentional and Reward Networks Synchronize During Media Induced Flow Experiences? A Test of the Synchronization Theory of Flow,3,"Flow is a positively valenced psychological state characterized by focused attention and reward that is thought to result from a balance between task challenge and individual skill. The central prediction of the synchronization theory of flow understands flow as an emergent property of a network synchronization process that manifests itself in functional connectivity between attentional and reward structures during flow-inducing media use. However, there is no well-established procedure for experimentally manipulating the construct. In three behavioral experiments, we validated a protocol for manipulating flow. This included the development of an open-source video game stimulus that allowed for a high degree of experimental control while providing a log of in-game events. Three conditions were manipulated: (1) boredom – low challenge/high skill, (2) frustration – high challenge/low skill, and (3) flow – balanced challenge/skill. This procedure was then replicated in a brain-imaging (fMRI) context where the results were largely consistent with theoretical predictions.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems
2016-0389,2016,Paper Session,Examining Moral Differences in News Coverage Across Sources and Topics Using the News Narrative Analyzer,3,"Latent moral content pervades mass media, and the Model of Intuitive Moralilty and Exemplars (MIME; Tamborini, 2012) provides a theoretical framework for understanding its implications. The MIME holds that insulation from media content challenging one's moral views fosters polarized values within ideological groups and reduces openness to divergent views. In order to better understand how moral themes in the news serve as indicators of political affiliation and selectively appeal to specific ideological groups, we have developed the News Narrative Analyzer. The NNA integrates the best techniques from human content-analysis and computational language processing to produce a complex and rich information system comprising both mainstream and radical sources. Our goal is to use those techniques to essentially sequence the moral DNA of latent narratives in news coverage, providing new insight into the reciprocal processes of media selection and effects outlined by the MIME model.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems
2016-0390,2016,Paper Session,Don’t Spoil It! Examining Spoilers as Impediments to the Intrinsic Rewards of Narrative Engagement,7,"Conventional wisdom suggests that narrative spoilers can ruin entertainment experiences, but research on the effects of spoilers on enjoyment is mixed. Building on a mental models approach to narrative processing, this study proposes that narrative engagement increases enjoyment by satisfying intrinsic psychological needs. Spoilers were expected to decrease enjoyment by disrupting need fulfillment. Undergraduate students (N = 220) were randomly assigned to receive a narrative spoiler, or no spoiler before viewing a TV show episode in pairs. Results revealed that competence and relatedness rewards mediated the effect of narrative engagement on enjoyment. Exposure to a narrative spoiler decreased competence, and in turn enjoyment. This effect interacted with viewing social context, applying to spoiled participants who viewed the episode in the presence of a coviewer who was not spoiled. Findings contribute to understanding the narrative engagement process, the effects of spoilers, and the role of social context in media effects.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems
2016-0391,2016,Paper Session,Don’t Tell Me How It Ends: Testing Effects of Narrative Spoilers for Film and Television,2,"Recent research into narrative spoilers shows modest impacts, both positive and negative, on users’ enjoyment. These effects appear to be mediated by processing fluency and moderated by needs for cognition and affect. However, the evidence is largely based on literary short stories, which produce low baseline involvement. Three studies were conducted to make use of a variety of television and film stimuli, testing various aspects of narrative engagement that might account for spoiler effects. Study 1 used television and film clips to replicate previous findings, and reconsider the role of genre. Study 2 used film posters to test how genre preferences and the framing of a spoiler message affect enjoyment, as well as psychological reactance. Study 3 surveyed viewers of a popular television series adapted from a book series, testing earlier findings but also examining attitudes towards spoilers, social contexts, and spoilers that are discrepant between adaption and source material.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems

Experiential involvement is central to narrative-consistent belief, attitude, and behavior change, though little is known about the message factors that inspire experiential involvement. The present investigates the impact of gender, race, and social role audience-character similarity on forms of narrative involvement (identification, transportation, and narrative engagement) when viewing a comic strip message. Viewers who matched on social role (i.e., the social group or role) of the character had significantly higher levels of identification, transportation, and the sub-dimensions of narrative presence and emotional engagement. Gender and race similarity did not predict involvement. The study provides implications for features that inspire narrative processing.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems

The audience is not always experiencing the narrative world through the eyes of a character, but instead alternates between identification and spectatorship. In the realm of human cognition, this entails fluctuating activation between the mirror and mentalizing systems. This study will utilize fMRI technology, and examine fluctuations between the mirror and mentalizing systems as a function of trait empathy components, varying camera angles, and what skilled filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock termed ‘disparities of knowledge’ between the audience and story characters.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems
2016-0395,2016,Paper Session,The Importance of Imagery for Effects of Narratives in Health Education Materials on Knowledge,3,"This research examines the role of imagery for the effect that narratives in health education materials have on knowledge. It focuses on the effects of two strategies to apply the narrative format in health education materials. These strategies are (1) replacing the traditionally used non-narrative texts with narratives, and (2) adding testimonials to non-narrative texts. Secondary data analyses are conducted using path modelling on data from three previously conducted experiments. Results show that both strategies can increase imagery, but that the effect is stronger for the testimonials strategy. However, it appears that the effect of testimonials is primarily caused by the repetition of information rather than the narrative form of testimonials. Imagery both has a direct and indirect effect on the cognitive effort that is invested, which in turn has a positive effect on knowledge. Hence, the facilitation imagery is an important factor for establishing effects on knowledge.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems
2016-0396,2016,Paper Session,The Influence of Shot Scale on Theory of Mind Responding in Visual Narratives,3,"The significance of theory of mind, defined as attributing intentions, feelings and thoughts to others, is well established in media reception studies. In order to elucidate how form features of audio-visual stories affect this response the present study investigated the effect of shot scale distribution on theory of mind responding in film viewers. Animated movies were annotated for shot scale distribution and presented in a within-subject design. Employing a mixed method data collection participants were asked to retell the story of the films and fill in questionnaires on narrative experience. Skin conductance was also measured during exposure. Story-descriptions were content analysed for theory of mind responses. In a Poisson-regression model shot scale distribution predicted theory of mind response indicating that increasing spatial proximity triggered higher activity of theory of mind. The findings elucidate how formal properties of character presentation affect audiences’ mental models of a character.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems
