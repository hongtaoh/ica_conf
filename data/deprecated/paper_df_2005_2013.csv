2013-0951,“I Want to Go Out With You” vs. “I Want to Talk to You”: Corpus Analysis of Gender Differences in Mobile Text Messages of Adolescents,Sex and Romance and Sexual Identity: Exploring Links With Media (High Density Session),Children Adolescents and Media,Paper,,“I Want to Go Out With You” vs. “I Want to Talk to You”: Corpus Analysis of Gender Differences in Mobile Text Messages of Adolescents,Sex and Romance and Sexual Identity: Exploring Links With Media (High Density Session),"The objectives of this study are (1) to investigate gender differences in mobile texting behavior among adolescents and (2) to examine a novel methodology – corpus comparison analysis – in analyzing mobile-phone-based interactions. Applying corpus comparison method, the present study especially delineates patterns of expressions used in actual text messages. Results revealed that gender differences persist in texting behavior: (1) girls exchange more messages than boys do; (2) girls are more likely to develop and maintain relationship through texting, whereas boys use text messages mainly for flirting; (3) language which girls used in texting includes more self-disclosure of their emotions and personal information; (4) expressions for politeness occur more frequently in girls’ text messages. Theoretical explanations of gender differences in mobile texting are provided. The strengths and limitations of keyword comparison method are discussed as well."

This is an excerpt from Reviving the Self: Beyond the Wandering Womb (working title of a book in progress). In Chapter 2: Letting go of superwoman: Embodying the mother-child dyad, I present findings from 44 in-depth interviews with biological mothers of newborns to understand how the mother-child dyad impacted their meaning making of health. Participants acknowledged the intrinsic duality of the mother-child dyad and reformulated traditional expectations of “putting the baby first.” This chapter weaves an eclectic mix of feminist theory and scholars, including Foucault, Pollock, Martin and Friedan to explicate how women make meaning of medicalization. Participants described a contest over their bodies in relation to diet and exercise before, during, and after pregnancy. These women resisted the biomedical paradigm in various ways, such as through trusting their bodies and valuing storytelling and personal narrative as a form of expertise."
2013-1051,Making the World a Distant Place? How Foreign TV News Affects Individual Cynicism in Post-Colonial Hong Kong,Covering the World: Foreign Correspondents and Foreign News,Journalism Studies,Paper,"Bias in News, Media Effects - Other, Quantitative approach",Making the World a Distant Place? How Foreign TV News Affects Individual Cynicism in Post-Colonial Hong Kong,Covering the World: Foreign Correspondents and Foreign News,"This paper examines the psychological impact of foreign television news on political cynicism in Hong Kong. We hypothesize that exposure to the prevalent negative events and conflicts in international news will lead to the audience’s cynical perception of the world. Given Hong Kong’s colonial history and its highly mobilized population, we further investigate the role of individual globality and immigration status in the process. A random digit dialing telephone survey was conducted in 2009 to select a sample of 600 Hong Kong residents aged between 18 and 70. The results showed that individual attention to foreign news of deviants was positively associated with political cynicism among those first-generation immigrants who were born in mainland China or elsewhere, but negatively related among local Hong Kongers. The implications of the findings were discussed."

Usual explanations for the success of these parties are based on notions related to economics, national identity or cultural alienation. Some authors, however, have shown that the mass media also play a significant role. Whereas these studies provide evidence drawing on macro-level data resources and/or qualitative accounts, there is little systematic evidence about how mass media coverage may affect support for the populist right on the level of the individual voter. The current study adds to the existing literature on media and political populism by 1) its individual-level focus, 2) the use of an experimental design employing multiple cues: an immigration cue, an anti-politics cue and a party cue, and 3) by drawing on explicit and implicit data for party support. We find effects of certain cues on both implicit and explicit support for far right parties, moderated by political knowledge."
2013-1151,m-Health: A Systematic Review of the First 10 Years of Research,Diverse Facets of ICT Use (CAT High Density Panel II),Communication and Technology,Paper,"Mobile Media, Health Communication, Internet / New Technology",m-Health: A Systematic Review of the First 10 Years of Research,Diverse Facets of ICT Use (CAT High Density Panel II),"In the last decade m-Health has expanded as a part of e‐Health. Yet, systematic research on the impact of mobile technologies on health outcomes remains scarce. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive view of what has been done so far, and to understand how the introduction of new smartphones has changed research in the field. A systematic literature review was conducted on a sample of 117 articles published between 2002 and 2012 to understand the main impact areas of mobile technologies, the methodology and the features used, and the type of outcome measures adopted. Results showed that the research interest towards m‐Health is growing, however the new opportunities offered by new mobile technologies do not seem to have been explored so far. Mapping the evolution of the field permits a better understanding of its strengths and weaknesses, and can inform future developments."

Social Origin of Online Privacy Concern and its Behavioral Implications",Privacy and Trust in the Online Environment,Communication and Technology,Paper,"Internet / New Technology, Public Opinion","My Privacy is Okay, But Theirs is Endangered! Social Origin of Online Privacy Concern and its Behavioral Implications",Privacy and Trust in the Online Environment,"On the Internet, people’s activities are easily traced and collected, and online privacy infringement (i.e., improper use of personal information) has been reported in advanced societies. Based on prior studies on risk perception, this study examines comparative optimism of online privacy infringement (i.e., users tend to believe privacy infringement is less likely to happen to the user than others), and its antecedents and consequences. Relying on large scale online survey data in South Korea (N = 2,028), this study finds that (1) comparative optimism is enlarged as the targeted others are younger, (2) online knowledge and others-caring personality increases comparative optimism by mainly influencing perceived target risk and prior experience of privacy infringement increases comparative optimism by mainly influencing perceived personal risk, and (3) comparative optimism is related with both more adoption of privacy-protective behaviors and support for government regulatory policy on the use of online information."
2013-1251,News Media Use and the Informed Public in the Digital Age,"Changing Media Environments, Changing Media Use Patterns",Political Communication,Paper,"Political Knowledge & Sophistication, News / Journalism, Internet / New Technology",News Media Use and the Informed Public in the Digital Age,"Changing Media Environments, Changing Media Use Patterns","Questions concerning the primary sources of political information and their efficacy are of perennial concern in political communication research. Although research in this area is known for a number of stable patterns, we argue that these are under greater strain than ever before, and that key assumptions about how individuals acquire political information from the media must be continually investigated. In this paper, we use data from a nationally representative online survey to provide just such a reexamination of relationships between news media use and political knowledge. We find that by some measures, directed internet searches have come to rival television news as a source for information, and that newspapers no longer appear to have the strongest educative influences. In addition to providing an updated assessment of media use and political knowledge patterns, we consider the implications of our findings for contemporary theoretical discussions within the field of political communication."
2013-1301,Online Sophistication of News Websites,New Perspectives on Journalistic Structures and Labor,Journalism Studies,Paper,"Online media/blogs, International/comparative research, Quantitative approach",Online Sophistication of News Websites,New Perspectives on Journalistic Structures and Labor,"After a comparatively short period of time, the internet has become the second most important source of news (Pew Research Center, 2011). Whilst new forms of presentation and user participation make a ""way new journalism"" possible (Quittner, 1995), researchers around the world criticize that news websites do not live up to their potentials. To offer an explanation for the slow adaption, we examine if there is a path dependency between news websites’ online sophistication and their structural background. Based on a large-scale automated content analysis, we analyze the use of hyperlinks, multimedia, and polls on 84 news websites from 9 countries that comprises about 65,000 news articles. We found that institutional factors (media system, nation, media type) have a far stronger influence on websites’ online sophistication than content-related factors. While we also found indicators that news websites have detached from their offline backgrounds, this proves that path dependency is strong."
2013-1351,Parent-Child Joint Reading in Traditional and iPad Formats,Learning and Socializing Through Use of Mobile Devices and Games,Children Adolescents and Media,Paper,,Parent-Child Joint Reading in Traditional and iPad Formats,Learning and Socializing Through Use of Mobile Devices and Games,"With the growth of electronic technologies, such as the iPad, parents are now able to read to their children using different platforms. This study used a repeated-measures design with parents and their preschool-aged children to test the difference between reading interactions on two platforms: traditional books and electronic iPad books. Children’s story comprehension was also measured. Overall, results indicated that in the iPad joint reading condition, parents used more disciplinary comments, and more talk about the book format and environment than in the traditional book condition. Conversely, in the traditional book condition, parents used more evaluative comments and asked more questions about the content of the book than in the iPad condition. Finally, children did comprehend significantly more in the traditional book condition than in the iPad book condition. Additional analyses suggested that this last finding was related to the increase in distraction talk by parents in the iPad condition."
2013-1401,Play to the Camera: Audio-Visual Research and Spectatorship in e-Sports,Game Studies Top Papers,Game Studies,Paper,,Play to the Camera: Audio-Visual Research and Spectatorship in e-Sports,Game Studies Top Papers,"Competitive video gaming (also referred to as electronic sports, or “e-Sports”) includes a range of organizations, communities, and sets of practices that place tremendous value (both monetary and cultural) on audiences: playing games competitively, in front of other people, represents the legitimization of e-Sports as a spectatorial activity. This paper reports on an audio-visual ethnography of a community of competitive gamers for whom the video camera was not so much a research tool, but a promotional resource.

Through an a comparison of the different “activity structures” enacted by the researcher’s dual role as ethnographer and promotional videographer, this paper explores the methodological and epistemological complexities that can arise when digital technologies that are central to the communicative practices of a community become, at the same time, data collection tools for researchers."

However, whether this is also valid for politicians and the perceived political influence of online media is unclear. Thus, a survey among the members of the German Bundestag (n = 194) was conducted. As predicted, the stronger parliamentarians perceive the political influence of online media to be on the public, the more the parliamentarians agree to demands to limit this influence. However, it is not important if the political online influence is explicitly evaluated as negative."

eight out of them are in Europe. In addition, thirteen European countries now recognize
some form of civil union, and several are considering it, including the Slovak Republic.
This paper presents a discourse analysis of the plenary speeches by the members of the
Slovak Parliament from October 2012 in response to the recent proposal of a Registered
Partnership Law. Drawing on data collected through online ethnography, including
textual and audiovisual data from the digital archive of the Slovak Parliament, media
sources and discussion forums, this case study is part of a larger study that maps the sites
of LGBT visibility in Slovakia. Its main goal is to uncover the conflicting discursive
frames used by the proponents and opponents of same-sex unions, and to identify their
political significance and their impact on the lives of same-sex couples in contemporary
Slovakia."
2013-1551,"Representation Matters (?): When, How and if Media Representation Matters to Marginalized Game Audiences","New Questions of Audiences, Publics, and Participants",Popular Communication,Paper,"Audience, Videogames, Identity","Representation Matters (?): When, How and if Media Representation Matters to Marginalized Game Audiences","New Questions of Audiences, Publics, and Participants","Research on minority representation in video games usually begins from the assumption that representation matters, typically in a social or political sense. In contrast, this paper uses interviews and participant observation to investigate why, when and how representation is important to individuals who are members of marginalized groups, focusing on sexuality, gender and race in the U.S. It demonstrates that arguments that focus on specific identity groups and niche marketing actually hinder the political goals of media visibility. In games, at least, representation comes to matter at the nexus of several of factors including: a given audience member’s reasons for using a text; how individual players/viewers understand their identities; how and if the representation is made relevant in a given text; the context in which the text is consumed; and the social sphere in which those texts are created and consumed. The implications of these findings are addressed in the conclusion."
2013-1601,Self-Affirmation Before Exposure to Persuasive Health Communications Promotes Anticipated Regret and Health Behavior Change,Communication Influences on Health Behavior and Behavioral Change,Health Communication,Paper,,Self-Affirmation Before Exposure to Persuasive Health Communications Promotes Anticipated Regret and Health Behavior Change,Communication Influences on Health Behavior and Behavioral Change,"It may be tempting to elicit the negative emotion of anticipated regret in persuasive health communications because of its positive influence on intentions and behavior. However, this is not always appropriate and can even trigger defensive reactions in target audiences. In two studies, we show that self-affirming (reflecting upon cherished values) before message exposure provides an indirect strategy to accomplish similar beneficial effects. Women were self-affirmed or not before exposure to a message promoting fruit and vegetable consumption. Self-affirmation increased anticipated regret and intentions, and the effects of self-affirmation on intentions were mediated by regret (Studies 1 and 2). Moreover, self-affirmation increased consumption during one week following the intervention in Study 2. Self-affirming people before exposing them to persuasive health communications thus promotes anticipated regret and health behavior change. Furthermore, by demonstrating the mediating role of anticipated regret, we provide novel insights into how self-affirmation promotes healthy intentions."
2013-1651,Social Sedia Use and Participation in the January 25 Egyptian Uprising: Comparing Participants and Nonparticipants in Street Protest,Twitter Politics: How Twitter Facilitates Political Movement?,Communication and Technology,Paper,"Social Media, Quantitative approach, Social Movements",Social Sedia Use and Participation in the January 25 Egyptian Uprising: Comparing Participants and Nonparticipants in Street Protest,Twitter Politics: How Twitter Facilitates Political Movement?,"Previous studies have shown that social media use among participants in the 25 January Egyptian uprising was high and that protesters indicate that social media were important in their decision to join the protests (Tufekci & Wilson, 2012; Wilson & Dunn, 2011). However, other studies suggest that the attitudes toward the regime and toward democracy in general prior to the uprising were no different from non-users of social media (Norris, 2012). So far, no direct comparison has been made between protesters and an equivalent group of non-protesters in terms of their social media use. In this paper, we use data that have been gathered by Vote Compass Egypt, an online voting tool, to compare protesters and non-protesters in their use of different sources of political information. The results show that participants in the 25 January uprising rely more on Facebook and Twitter to get political information, and less on mass media (radio and TV). The association between protest participation and social media use is mediated by higher optimism about the future of the country, more democratic attitudes and less trust in government. Use of mass media is associated with less protest participation through more trust in government."
2013-1701,Sweden: Are Direct Press Subsidies the Preferred Solution?,Policy Failure in Confronting the Journalism Crisis: Evidence From the US and Europe,Communication Law & Policy,Session Paper,,Sweden: Are Direct Press Subsidies the Preferred Solution?,Policy Failure in Confronting the Journalism Crisis: Evidence From the US and Europe,"Direct press subsidies to second-ranking newspapers in the market are undoubtedly one of the most distinctive features of Swedish media policy. They have been used since 1971, when a political majority from the Social Democratic Party and the Centre Party reached on agreement in the Parliament. The system has always been highly controversial; perceived either as an attack on the free press or as a guarantee for pluralism in the market. In recent years, digital media developments and EU media policy have put the press subsidy system and its basic principles under new pressures. The efficiency of the system is also disputed. The subsidies have saved newspapers with economic problems and the decrease in newspaper titles in Sweden is not as articulated as in many other countries. On the other hand, the system has not affected media ownership concentration and most subsidized newspapers are today owned by commercially successful companies."

In the post-liberalized Indian film industry, which gained official economic recognition in 1998, proponents assert that digital technologies are revolutionizing the popular Hindi film industry, particularly through the expansion of online streaming services, mass retailing of DVD and blu-ray discs, and construction of multiplex cinemas that feature high-definition digital and 3-D stereoscopic viewing options, as has been the case elsewhere in Asia (Curtin, 2009; Ganti, 2012; Rai, 2009; Stephanie, Sharma, & Ramasubbu, 2012). However, critics assert that such technologies also threaten to demassify consumption practices in South Asia, disrupting democratic viewing traditions within these cinematic public spheres (Ganti, 2012). In this presentation, I explore the technological and social issues relative to the rapid transition from celluloid to digital exhibition in South Asia, and then position these issues within broader theoretical debates over globalization and cultural hybridity."
2013-1801,The Digital Globe and Climactic Coming Attractions: From Theatrical Release to Theatre of War,Earth Observing Media,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique",Session Paper,,The Digital Globe and Climactic Coming Attractions: From Theatrical Release to Theatre of War,Earth Observing Media,"This paper considers the politics of representation inherent in the emergence of the digital globe. Starting with a consideration of early renaissance globes as separate and distinct cultural objects from the two dimensional forms of cartography they followed, this article goes on to consider the emergence of the digital globe. Like its analogue predecessors, the digital globe is an object symptomatic of the multiple cultural, political, philosophical, ecological and sociological factors that form its foundation. Crucially, beyond occidental perspectives that have structured many dominant cartographic accounts of the earth since the renaissance, this article argues that a multipolar environment of online digital globes are emerging to contest western structures of vision that were intertwined with notions of technoscopic superiority of the twentieth century. Instead what is now emerging is a multiplicity of digital globes that function as theatrical platforms for different and diverse agencies. Here the digital globe is analysed in relation to some of their theatrical functions: as a site of spectacular cinematic attractions, as theatre for the dramatic staging of news media events, as a simulated military theatre of operations, as a lecture theatre where the science of geo-engineering is dramatized and as an operation theatre where the planets rapidly declining health is played out."
2013-1851,"The ""Feminization"" of the Media in Postcommunist Eastern Europe",Women Journalists in Turbulent Times: The Gendered Impact of Historical Shifts on Newsrooms,Feminist Scholarship,Session Paper,,"The ""Feminization"" of the Media in Postcommunist Eastern Europe",Women Journalists in Turbulent Times: The Gendered Impact of Historical Shifts on Newsrooms,"Findings in the 2011 Global Report on the Status of Women found women to surpass men in both number and status in a majority of news companies surveyed in the region of Eastern Europe, leading to the perception of news as a feminized field. Women’s presence in media companies in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, particularly, grew faster than men’s. This presentation problematizes the finding of women’s dominance within the historical framework of communism and in light of events in today’s post-communist era. Factors examined include labor issues under communism, women’s skills levels and adaptability to change, and the shift to a commercialized media system that brought with it an entertainment-orientation in media content and a sensationalism of news. The presentation will also explore why women’s dominance in media fields has done little to erase the underlying patriarchal nature of Eastern European societies."
2013-1901,"The Israeli Term for Talk ""Tokbek"" (Talk-Back - Online Commenting) and its Relevance to the Online Public Sphere",Technologically-Mediated Interactions: Problems and Promises for Civic Engagement and Interpersonal Interactions,Language & Social Interaction,Extended Abstract,,"The Israeli Term for Talk ""Tokbek"" (Talk-Back - Online Commenting) and its Relevance to the Online Public Sphere",Technologically-Mediated Interactions: Problems and Promises for Civic Engagement and Interpersonal Interactions,"Israeli journalistic websites introduced a feature that later became popular elsewhere - the ""comments"" section where readers can inscribe their responses to the report. This form of commenting received its own term for talk tokbek, derived from the English term “talk-back.” From cultural members' perspective, while the tokbek had unlimited technological potential to promote new modes of civil engagement, it failed in achieving this goal and evolved to an anti-discourse that frequently undermines attempts on constructive dialogue. Grounded in the ethnography of communication, we provide a cultural interpretative framework for the analysis of this discursive failure. The main communicative action of the tokbek is to construct the commenters’ political selves, mainly based on “the Leftist” and “the Rightist” stereotypes. The tokbek discourse thus facilitates a bashing ritual that communicates a radical pessimism about the very possibility of its own communicability. So doing, the tokbek ritual joins similar Israeli cultural performances that substitute democratic deliberation with a pseudo-political venting arena. While not implying that the internet is incapable of promoting a democratic public sphere, we contend that cultural contexts as established through interactions cannot be overlooked when discussing technological advancements and their relevancy to political participation."
2013-1951,The Political Mapping of Korean Twitter Users,Politics Online: International Perspectives,Political Communication,Paper,"Quantitative - Network Analysis, Deliberation & Political Conversation",The Political Mapping of Korean Twitter Users,Politics Online: International Perspectives,"This study employs network analysis, while focusing on the discussion of South Korean president, Lee Myung-Bak, to better understand public opinion dynamics occurring on Twitter. More specifically, the study seeks to identify opinion leaders on the discussion network by looking over a longitudinal distribution of tweets that include the president’s name. In so doing, this study analyzed three types of messages: “followed,” “mention,” and “retweet.” The data, collected between November 1, 2011 and April 20, 2012, includes 53,165 twitter users and 1,144,306 lines consisting of three types of relationship. By looking over the density of subgroups classified by their political view, the study also examines whether Twitter users, in their discussion of the president, are likely to be exposed to cross-cutting political views. The findings show that the discussion of Lee Myung-Bak is dominated by liberal Twitter users who already have great influence on the public even offline. Furthermore, Twitter users appear unlikely to interact with those who have opposing political views."

We build upon research in communication, political science, social psychology, and social networks to identify relevant predictors. We analyze relationships at the dyadic level, but we also consider the aggregated accuracy of perceptions by ego of alters (“perceptiveness”) and the aggregated accuracy of perception by alters of ego (“explicitness”) regarding political candidate preferences using a multilevel modeling approach. We find relatively low levels of accuracy on average, and differential patterns of prediction of perceptiveness and explicitness. However, there is a consistent and strong link between the frequency of communication (viewed as an indicator of network tie strength) and accuracy both at the dyadic and aggregate levels. However, this relationship is moderated by the homophily of political preferences within the group."
2013-2051,The Ubiquity and Influence of CMC Cues in Social Networking Sites,Nonverbal Cues Exchanges in Online Communications,Communication and Technology,Paper,"Computer-Mediated Communication, Social Media, Social Networking Service",The Ubiquity and Influence of CMC Cues in Social Networking Sites,Nonverbal Cues Exchanges in Online Communications,"A significant portion of the online activities by customers and other organizational stakeholders use text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC). Facebook status updates, Tweets, blog posts and e-mails are used for communicating organizational messages, engaging customers, and spreading electronic word of mouth. It has been suggested that CMC cues are those components of text-based CMC which fulfill a comparable role to that carried out by nonverbal cues in spoken communication. We make use of linguistic and quantitative analyses of several thousand Facebook and Twitter messages to empirically demonstrate the ubiquity and influence of these cues in online messages posted to social networking sites (SNSs). We establish that CMC cues have an influence comparable to that of nonverbal cues in spoken communication by showing that (1) the presence of specific CMC cues is associated with changes in SNS audience engagement and attitude, and (2) there is an inverse relationship between message length and CMC cue density. The paper discusses the theoretical implications for CMC theories such as social information processing, media richness theory, and a series of theories which developed in response to the failure of media richness theory to predict the meteoric success of text-based CMC in organizational and interpersonal communication."

Focusing on a central but little-studied figure, the documentary photographer Humphrey Spender, I analyze the politics of representing people--and of being represented--through documentary photography in the media environment of 1930s Britain. Based on archival research as well as formal analysis, this study links Spender’s photography with broader developments in the history of media in the period, including the grassroots sociological research group Mass Observation, the cinematic experimentation of the Continental avant-garde, the British documentary movement, and the rise of photographically illustrated magazines like Picture Post. In so doing, it illuminates a crucial development in the history of photography: a historical moment when the camera was seen to have the capacity to reveal the truth only when it was itself concealed."

Studying anti-fans, then, enables us to bring our focus to an exploration of the expectations and values we have of media texts. Such an exploration is useful for understanding the divergent responses from fans and anti-fans to the Twilight series. Through a sample of 472 anti-Twilighters, collected alongside a larger sample of Twilight fans, we explore anti-fans’ evaluations of the Twilight series (making sense of why their “favorite character” is a van that almost killed the series’ protagonist) and its fans (whom anti-fans call “Twitards”). By comparing the characteristics of anti-Twilighters to Twilight fans, we discuss why the two groups are so polarized, and how anti-Twilighters can extend our knowledge of anti-fans more generally.

2013-2201,Validating Measures of Health-Related Conversation Content in the Context of Sleep Behavior Among College Students,Communication Influences on Health Behavior and Behavioral Change,Health Communication,Paper,,Validating Measures of Health-Related Conversation Content in the Context of Sleep Behavior Among College Students,Communication Influences on Health Behavior and Behavioral Change,"This research examined the validity of new measures of conversation partners and content to predict beliefs about sleep. A convenience sample of undergraduate students (n=375) completed a written questionnaire that asked about the frequency of sleep-related conversation, number of conversation partners, content of sleep-related conversation, and beliefs about sleep behaviors (based on the Integrative Model of Behavior Prediction). Conversations about health-damaging sleep behaviors were associated with the beliefs that sleeping 8-9 hours of sleep per night (a) will produce unfavorable social and academic outcomes and (b) are largely out of one’s behavioral control. Measures of conversation content explained more variance than simple measures of frequency and predicted lower intentions to perform the behavior. Content-specific conversation measures appear to be valid and should be considered in future health communication research."

Specifically, this study examines (1) the degree to which journalists use public relations materials, and (2) what factors influence the use of public relations materials.

A Web survey was conducted in December 2009 for U.S. business journalists (N = 120).

The results showed that public relations materials were most frequently used as a story’s background information and/or as a minor part of a story that came from another source or from several sources. Among the fourteen factors, journalistic experience, time pressure, ongoing relationships via e-mail and social media, and the perceived value of public relations materials had significant impacts on the degree of use of public relations materials."

The aim of the current study is to provide insight into the moral evaluations of medical dramas by medical students and physicians in order to formulate if and how medical dramas might be used as a tool in ethics education, thereby bringing clarity to the discussion over the proposed merit it could have in such a curriculum. A qualitative study was conducted that included in-depth interviews (N = 40) among a divers sample of medical students and physicians. The results show that the moral evaluations of a medical drama changed over time due to more (theoretical and practical) knowledge and experience and therefore a more nuanced view of the profession and professional ethics."
