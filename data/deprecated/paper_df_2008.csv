2008-0001,A 10-Year Systematic Review of HIV/AIDS Mass Communication Campaigns: Have We Made Progress?,Progress and Perspectives in Communicating About HIV/AIDS,,,,Paper,A 10-Year Systematic Review of HIV/AIDS Mass Communication Campaigns: Have We Made Progress?,Progress and Perspectives in Communicating About HIV/AIDS,"The purpose of the current study was to conduct a 10-year systematic review of HIV/AIDS mass communication campaigns (1998  2007) and to compare the results to the last comprehensive review of such campaigns, conducted by Myhre and Flora (2000). A comprehensive search strategy yielded 36 HIV/AIDS campaign evaluation articles published in peer-reviewed journals, representing 33 distinct campaign efforts conducted in 23 countries. The articles were coded on a variety of campaign design and evaluation dimensions by 2 independent coders. Results indicated that compared with the previous systematic review (1986  1998 period), campaigns have increasingly: 1) targeted defined audiences developed through audience segmentation procedures; 2) designed campaign themes around behavior change (rather than knowledge change); 3) used behavioral theories; 4) achieved high message exposure; 5) used stronger research designs for outcome evaluation; and 6) included measures of behavior (or behavioral intentions) in outcome assessments. In addition, an examination of 10 campaign efforts which used quasi-experimental designs revealed that the majority (8 of 10) demonstrated effects on behavior change or behavioral intentions. Despite these positive developments, most HIV/AIDS campaigns continue to use weak outcome evaluation designs. Implications of these results for improved design, implementation, and evaluation of HIV/AIDS campaign efforts are discussed."
2008-0002,"ABC, Agnew, and Richard Nixon's War on Network Television News",History of Journalism,,,,Paper,"ABC, Agnew, and Richard Nixon's War on Network Television News",History of Journalism,"Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew came to office with a distrust and visceral dislike of broadcast journalism. When broadcasters angered the administration with on-air commentary following a presidential address, Agnew lashed out with a series of speeches that broadcasters deemed as threatening to a business that is licensed by the government. While all the networks were targeted by the Nixon war on television, ABC was particularly vulnerable because it was the weakest economically. ABCs top executives were also sympathetic to Nixons administration. This paper draws on archival material to describe the Nixon war on television, particularly as it affected ABC."
2008-0003,Above the Influence: Development of a Brand to Reach Youth at the Moment of Decision About Drug Use,Maximizing Opportunities and Mitigating Threats to Success in a Large-Scale Antidrug Media Campaign for Youth,,,,Paper,Above the Influence: Development of a Brand to Reach Youth at the Moment of Decision About Drug Use,Maximizing Opportunities and Mitigating Threats to Success in a Large-Scale Antidrug Media Campaign for Youth,"Social marketing has borrowed branding from commercial marketing, where a pattern of symbols and language call to the target audiences mind all the information and associations inherent to the product. This paper will discuss the evolution of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaigns Above the Influence brand, with a particular emphasis on how campaign advertising reaches youth within their social contexts. This campaign has conducted extensive research with teens to develop a youth voice for advertising, which is then delivered through innovative channels that break through the clutter and reach youth with prevention messages at the moment of decision about drug use. Quantitative data on brand recognition, reach and frequency will be presented, in tandem with anecdotal information about how particular youth have embraced the ATI brand. Overall, this research demonstrates the value of branding to social marketing campaigns, particularly reaching teens with behavior change messages."
2008-0004,"A Brunswikian Lens Model Approach for Automatic, Multimodal Deception Detection",Deception and Trustworthiness,,,,Paper,"A Brunswikian Lens Model Approach for Automatic, Multimodal Deception Detection",Deception and Trustworthiness,"This article outlines an approach for automatically extracting behavioral indicators from video, audio, and text and explores the possibility of using those indicators to predict human-interpretable judgments of involvement, dominance, tenseness, and arousal. We utilized two-dimensional spatial inputs extracted from video, acoustic properties extracted from audio, and verbal content transcribed from face-to-face interactions to construct a set of multimodal features. Multiple predictive models were created using the extracted features as predictors and human-coded perceptions of involvement, tenseness, and arousal as criterion measures. The predicted perceptions were then used in classifying truth and deception. Though the predicted values for perceptions performed comparably to human-coded perceptions, their contribution to detecting deception was less successful. Thus, the extracted multimodal features were used to predict deception directly. Classification accuracy was substantially higher than typical human deception detection performance."
2008-0005,Abstracting the Real City,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,,,,Paper,Abstracting the Real City,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,"Recent studies in the USA and in Europe focus on the educational aspects of computer games, and discuss the possible psychological and sociological implications of simulation games. SimCity is a system simulation game that is frequently used in educational settings, and that is shown to be beneficial for students in terms of teaching simple economic concepts, mathematical skills and urban planning. This study aims to contribute to the literature of computer games studies by focusing on whether players in a different culture learn from the content of a game designed based on Western conceptualization. In a quasi-experimental research design with a group of 13 year old 7th graders in Turkey (n=248), it was found that students who play SimCity for 6 weeks learn and apply the concept of zoning, have greater sensitivity to city related issues, and have a higher level of anomie compared to those in the control group."
2008-0006,"A case study of the Red Lake, MN school shooting: Intercultural leaning in the renewal process","Public Relations, Organizational Learning and Renewal: Emerging Perspectives in Risk Communication",,,,Paper,"A case study of the Red Lake, MN school shooting: Intercultural leaning in the renewal process","Public Relations, Organizational Learning and Renewal: Emerging Perspectives in Risk Communication","As organizations and communities seek to recover from a crisis, they often move must balance and accommodate competing value systems. Failure to manage these value systems effectively can exacerbate a crisis. Using the shootings at the Red Lake, MN, public school in 2005 (Minnesota Public Radio, 2005) that left 10 people dead and seven injured as a focus for this case study, multiple data sources reveal the role of intercultural learning in the renewal process for the community. Lessons leaned indicate that the clash between the dominant and Native American culture created a secondary tension in the crisis. Management of the crisis required a rhetoric of privacy, a respect for the communitys values, and a more culturally-relevant interpretation of tribal free press."
2008-0007,Acceptance of Third-Generation (3G) Mobile Services in Singapore: Decomposing Perceived Critical Mass and Subjective Norms * (TOP FACULTY PAPER IN CAT),Psychology of Technology Adoption,,,,Paper,Acceptance of Third-Generation (3G) Mobile Services in Singapore: Decomposing Perceived Critical Mass and Subjective Norms * (TOP FACULTY PAPER IN CAT),Psychology of Technology Adoption,"This study examined the social and psychological factors influencing technology acceptance in the context of 3G mobile services in Singapore. The study theoretically extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by specifying the relationship between two social influence factors (perceived critical mass and subjective norms) and their distinct impacts on internal beliefs and behavior intentions pertaining to technology acceptance Using national survey data (n=201), this study examined competing models of social influence (e.g., utility versus normative perspectives). Overall, the findings suggest that perceived critical mass and subjective norms had the largest total effects on intentions to use 3G mobile services, confirming that acceptance of interactive media services are largely determined by social dynamics. Further, it was found that effect of social influence is multi-faceted to the extent that it can have a direct effect on intention through normative influence and an indirect effect though network externality or internalization. The findings demonstrate that it is critical to distinguish different types of social influence since they have conceptually and empirically different implications for behaviors."
2008-0008,Access to Broadcasting: Community Radio and Radio Communities,"Media Issues of Citizenship, Environment, and Health",,,,Paper,Access to Broadcasting: Community Radio and Radio Communities,"Media Issues of Citizenship, Environment, and Health","Community radio is both a participatory form of communication  broadcasting that represents some kind of ideological understanding about community organizing and participatory media, and in many countries, a formal sector of licensing. The difficulty for researchers interested in community radio is this distinction is not always made clear. Practical concerns regarding the legislative process, policy-making, technical considerations of frequency allocation, power restrictions and antenna height are very different  although related  to issues of community organizing and social gain. In taking the example of Britain, and examining community radio in practice among the three London stations, we can see where these regulatory issues in practice converge with more theoretical issues around community media as a form of alternative media, and practical issues around community broadcasting as a participatory media, and broader social and political issues around the right to communicate and citizens access to the airwaves.

This paper presents a framework for thinking about community media in a practical and regulatory context and thought a focused examination of community radio in London, unpacks the tensions around practice and theory. The study draws heavily on field research and first person interviews."
2008-0009,Access to the News Media: Right of Reply in Comparative Law,Frontiers in Free Expression,,,,Paper,Access to the News Media: Right of Reply in Comparative Law,Frontiers in Free Expression,"Although it is passé in American broadcasting law and has been a nonissue for American print media, the debate about the right of reply in the United States is alive and well forty years after George Washington University law professor Jerome Barron sparked it with his landmark law review article Access to the PressA New First Amendment Right. Significantly, the debate is refreshingly enriched by taking a discerning look at other democratic legal systems that are more experienced on the right of reply.
In the context of the growing acceptance of the right of reply in foreign law, this paper is a modest attempt to review the right of reply abroad while risking the nose-counting sin. This paper examines two questions as its main focus: How is the right of reply recognized in various countries with free press systems?; and What is the impact, whether actual or perceived, of the right of reply on freedom of the press?"
2008-0010,Accommodating the Nations: Cultural Citizenship in Monsoon Wedding,"Popular Culture, the Nation, and Globalization",,,,Paper,Accommodating the Nations: Cultural Citizenship in Monsoon Wedding,"Popular Culture, the Nation, and Globalization","In studying Mira Nairs diasporic film Monsoon Wedding in relation to processes of globalization and modernity, I argue that we must understand the film not as popular culture that can often position the popular as the other but as public culture in India that accommodates contested processes of globalization and economic change. Sites of consumption or pleasure are important for understanding new kinds of citizenship in the contexts of global flows of people and ideas. While the film uses the exotic to capture an international audience, it also subverts the neo-exotic discourse of the market. Its melodrama and excess disrupts social rules and economic hierarchies, giving way to pleasure and accommodation between essentialist categories of culture and belonging."
2008-0011,Accounting as Organizing Through Communicating: Calculating the Budget as a Complex Speech Act,Discursive Approaches to Organizing: Advances in Theory and Research,,,,Paper,Accounting as Organizing Through Communicating: Calculating the Budget as a Complex Speech Act,Discursive Approaches to Organizing: Advances in Theory and Research,"Abstract : This article aims to show how communication that enters into practices of accounting is in fact an organizing process. It hypothesizes that accounting statements are performative as well as constative. After a review of the performative view of organizations, it presents the result of an ethnographic field study centered on the budgetary process of site projects in a construction company. We show that calculating the budget is a complex activity that requires a good deal more speaking and negotiating than accounting theory predicts. Through speaking, the actors are accomplishing speech acts that are the basis of an organizing process, within which an authority structure is created, recreated and sometimes transformed."
2008-0012,Aceh Besar Midwives With Mobile-Phones Project,The Social Impact of Networking the Poor for Development,,,,Paper,Aceh Besar Midwives With Mobile-Phones Project,The Social Impact of Networking the Poor for Development,"Technology exists to use mobile telephones to transmit routine health service data from rural sites into a central health information system. A mobile-phone solution, incorporating the government health infrastructure, was developed for rural midwives based in tsunami-affected Aceh Besar, Indonesia, to improve healthcare for pregnant women and children. The Midwife Mobile Phone Project has begun in 15 public health centers, involving 223 midwives, 15 midwife coordinators and obstetricians/gynecologists. 122 midwives, forming the study group, use their project cellphones to link up to hospital-based doctors to aid complicated pregnancies, receive training and health support from midwife coordinators at health centers, and instantaneously deliver medical indicators via Internet-borne SMS to a central database. Results from a longitudinal survey, as well as from in-depth qualitative research, are presented to highlight the benefits and discuss the barriers to effectiveness.

2008-0013,A Cognitive Model for Understanding Online Gaming Addiction: A Preliminary Test in China,Game Studies Top Papers,,,,Paper,A Cognitive Model for Understanding Online Gaming Addiction: A Preliminary Test in China,Game Studies Top Papers,"Based on previous studies on Internet addiction, a cognitive model of online gaming addiction was proposed and tested in the current study to provide a better understanding of how online gaming addiction happens and what negative outcomes it leads to. This model proposes that maladaptive cognitions, self-regulation deficit, shyness, and depression are important predictors of online gaming addition, which consequently results in negative life consequences including physical problems, personal life problems, and educational/professional problems. Structural equation modeling was used to test the overall model as well as the theoretical relationships among these constructs. Results from a preliminary study surveying 115 online game players in China indicated an approximate model fit and supported all but one hypothesis."
2008-0014,A Communication Model for the Competent Delivery of Geriatric Medicine,Conceptual and Methodological Approaches to Studying Health Communication: Symposium from the International Association of Language and Social Psychology,,,,Paper,A Communication Model for the Competent Delivery of Geriatric Medicine,Conceptual and Methodological Approaches to Studying Health Communication: Symposium from the International Association of Language and Social Psychology,"Geriatric Medicine has become a health care specialty. Once older adults transition from independence to dependence, the health care system must respond to a complex set of interdependent networks that the system, and those who work within it, are not prepared to handle. The competent practice of geriatric medicine is dependent upon the coordination of numerous health specialists, organizations, and the patients social network. Failure to competently coordinate this system makes it nearly impossible to provide consistent quality health care resulting in misdiagnosis, increased cost, destruction of family relationships, professionals not willing to see older patients and, ultimately, higher mortality rates. This paper places communication at the core of any attempt to provide competent health care to older adults. A model is presented that places communication at the core of the practice of Geriatric Medicine while providing a road map for developing quality practices to improve older adults health care."
2008-0015,A Communication Model of Employee Cynicism Toward Organizational Change,Multiple Perspectives on Organizational Crisis and Change,,,,Paper,A Communication Model of Employee Cynicism Toward Organizational Change,Multiple Perspectives on Organizational Crisis and Change,"The study was designed to generate and test a model of employee cynicism toward organizational change from the communication perspective in a higher education institution. Previous studies mainly adopted psychological contract violation theory to explain employee cynicism, and the role of communication was largely ignored. Using the theoretical framework of social information processing, this study investigated the communication processes in the social context, which contributed to employee cynicism toward organizational change in the higher education setting. Path analysis was used to test the overall model fit. The findings suggest that the three variables, perceived quality of information, cynicism of colleagues, and trust in the administration, predict change-specific cynicism, which, in turn, lead to intention to resist change. As an initial attempt to explore the concept of change-specific cynicism from a communication perspective, this study points to a new direction which warrants the attention of communication scholars."
2008-0016,A Comparative Analysis Between Muslim and Non-Muslim Self-Construals and Conflict Styles in France and Britain,Top Four Papers in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,A Comparative Analysis Between Muslim and Non-Muslim Self-Construals and Conflict Styles in France and Britain,Top Four Papers in Intercultural Communication,"This study is a cross-cultural investigation of the conflict styles and self-construals of Muslims and non-Muslims in Britain and France. The sample consisted of 1198 participants from both nations. The findings reveal Muslims in both nations overwhelmingly prefer to use the integrating conflict style over other conflict styles. Non-Muslims in both nations also prefer this style, but also use other styles significantly. The findings also reveal Muslims show a significantly more interdependent self-construal, while non-Muslims display an independent self-construal. Furthermore, the study concluded that religiosity and ethnic identification are all significant predictors of avoiding, compromising, integrating, and obliging conflict styles. An independent self-construal and ethnic identification significantly predicted a dominating conflict style."
2008-0017,A Comparative Analysis of Climate Change in the Alternative and Mainstream Press of New Zealand and the United States,Framing News Content,,,,Paper,A Comparative Analysis of Climate Change in the Alternative and Mainstream Press of New Zealand and the United States,Framing News Content,"The public learns about climate change through the media. While mainstream media have been found to inadequately report on this issue in the United States, little research has examined how alternative media frame climate change and how the mainstream press in other countries are dealing with this important issue. On 22 March, Professor Tim O?Riordan, the British Sustainability Commissioner and advisor to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, gave a public speech arguing that climate change must be framed not as a sacrifice or a penalty but as an opportunity to benefit the future. Shortly after, Dr. Michael Nisbet and Chris Mooney wrote a much discussed article in Science that argued scientists must de-emphasize the facts and focus more on morality if important scientific problems are going to have any hope of abating. If such moralistic frames were to be found in the press, one might expect to see their presence initially in alternative outlets or in the mainstream press of countries that have a more receptive policy toward combating climate change. This research comparatively examines how Scoop, an independent news website based in New Zealand, and The New Zealand Herald, the most popular mainstream newspaper in New Zealand, are framing the issue of climate change in relation to The New York Times and AlterNet, an alternative news website based in the United States."
2008-0018,"A Comparison of Five Functions in the PDA: Importance, Ease of Use, Usefulness and Intention to Use",Mobile Media,,,,Paper,"A Comparison of Five Functions in the PDA: Importance, Ease of Use, Usefulness and Intention to Use",Mobile Media,"Many devices  for example, a multi-functional printer and a mobile phone  have integrated many distinct functions into one single unit. Previous research in the acceptance studies, specifically studies examining multi-functional devices, continues to examine the adoption of these technologies by applying an overall evaluation. Analyzing different functions separately is important as these functions may be unique. Especially, some individual functions  such as a camera or an mp3 player which is integrated in a mobile phone  are still sold separately. Drawing upon studies on information systems acceptance, this paper analyzes phone, organizer, Internet access, camera, and mp3 player, the five functions, in the PDA. A survey with more than 200 respondents showed that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of each function in the PDA can explain about 47 to 67 percent of the variance in usage intention of its function. Implications for manufactures of such a device are discussed."
2008-0019,A Comparison of the Introduction of Digital Terrestrial Television in the United States and Mainland China,Media Policy: Diversity and Integration,,,,Paper,A Comparison of the Introduction of Digital Terrestrial Television in the United States and Mainland China,Media Policy: Diversity and Integration,"This study compares the impact of media ownership, regulation and policy, and technology adoption on the introduction of digital terrestrial television in the United States and Mainland China. Through the use of a case study approach, a qualitative and quantitative examination is given. The results indicate that private group ownership throughout the U.S. digital terrestrial television industry and state ownership in Chinas television industry lead to the different paths to digital transition. Both governments, however, are deeply involved in respective digital initiatives and play an important role in the implementation from analog to digital. The technical standard adoption in the two countries places the underpinning for the future development of digital television (DTV), which also results in China lagging behind the United States by almost ten years. The differences of technological environments in households and income among consumers in the two countries further predict the intention to DTV adoption."
2008-0020,"A Conceptual Comparison of the Theoretical Approaches in Health Campaigns: Focusing on SET, TRA, TPB, HBM, and EPPM","Building Blocks, Missteps and Successes in Health Campaigns",,,,Paper,"A Conceptual Comparison of the Theoretical Approaches in Health Campaigns: Focusing on SET, TRA, TPB, HBM, and EPPM","Building Blocks, Missteps and Successes in Health Campaigns","This study reviewed some prominent theoretical approaches in health campaigns by offering a typology to show an overall picture of the dominant paradigms. Focusing on the SET, the TRA, the TPB, the HBM, and the EPPM, The current study compared the conceptualizations of key variables such as self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, perceived threat, and social influences. Based on the review, the study discussed limitations of current theoretical approaches and offered suggestions for building an integrative health campaign model."
2008-0021,A Content Analysis of Avian Influenza Communication on 31 Chinese E-Governmental Websites,Digital Public Relations,,,,Paper,A Content Analysis of Avian Influenza Communication on 31 Chinese E-Governmental Websites,Digital Public Relations,"Avian influenza is a serious threat to China and the world. It is imperative for Chinese governments to inform and prepare their publics through efficacious communication. To date, however, little research has examined Chinas avian influenza communication. This research was designed to fill the significant gap. A content analysis of the types and amounts of avian influenza communication on 31 Chinese province-level e-governmental websites was conducted. The e-government framework of Zhou (2004) guided the analysis. The results indicate that: 1) currently on the homepages there is no content or hyperlinks dedicated to avian influenza though general information (i.e., preventative measures) is retrievable through search bars, public forums, and input boxes; and these serve only e-governance and e-knowledge functions, but no e-service functions; 2) the types and amounts of communication to citizens, businesses and governments are almost identical on each website; 3) the amounts of communication vary from district to district."
2008-0022,A Content Analysis of Frequently Cited Sources in Cancer News Coverage: Examining the Relationship Between Cancer News Content and Source Citation,News Coverage of Cancer and Science: Content and Effects,,,,Paper,A Content Analysis of Frequently Cited Sources in Cancer News Coverage: Examining the Relationship Between Cancer News Content and Source Citation,News Coverage of Cancer and Science: Content and Effects,"Content analyses of cancer news coverage have found that certain content receives disproportionate attention; for example, new stories were more likely to focus on cancer treatment than on cancer prevention. A content analysis of cancer news articles from the top 44 circulating newspapers in the U.S. (N = 3,656) revealed that sources cited in cancer news articles?research institutions, medical journals, pharmaceutical companies?also receive disproportionate attention. Research institutions were the most frequently cited source in cancer news coverage, exerting significant influence over mentions of the cancer continuum. Clinical trial coverage was found to rely heavily on research institutions, medical journals, and pharmaceutical companies. Over half of all stories about clinical trials cited a research institution, and one in four cited medical journals or pharmaceutical companies. Most clinical trial stories were optimistic or neutral in tone, and tone was significantly related to citations of pharmaceutical companies and medical journals. Implications for news practices and effects of cancer coverage are discussed."
2008-0023,"A Content Analysis of Youth Sexualized Language and Imagery in Adult Film Packaging, 1995-2007",x and the Media,,,,Paper,"A Content Analysis of Youth Sexualized Language and Imagery in Adult Film Packaging, 1995-2007",Sex and the Media,"This study defines youth sexualized language (YSL)sexual language that contains references to young people/youthand youth sexualized imagery (YSI)sexual photographs, drawings, or other visual depictions that contain references to young people/youthand seeks to quantify the frequency of both in mainstream adult film packaging. A content analysis of 2,600 mainstream adult film covers released from 1995 to 2007 revealed that over 20% of covers contained YSL, YSI, or both, including references to and depictions of teens, braces, pigtails, stuffed animals, and school uniforms."
2008-0024,A Critical Review of the Participatory Potential in Media for Social Change,"Media Issues of Citizenship, Environment, and Health",,,,Paper,A Critical Review of the Participatory Potential in Media for Social Change,"Media Issues of Citizenship, Environment, and Health","I aim to critique projects in the field of population, assessing the structural conditions of campaigns in relation to their projected themes and goals. In this paper I focus on social marketing and media advocacy projects. Typically ensconced in social marketing and entertainment education programs, media for social change has begun to recognize the potential for media advocacy in offering distinct possibilities in the efforts of social movement as well as development organizations. Yet even these media advocacy strategies, while in theory being designed to address socially beneficial normative, structural and policy change, in practice become mired in the dominant ideological push toward privatization of the development industry. An underlying concern is with the propensity of development projects to facilitate rather than question the privatization of programs designed for the public good."
2008-0025,"A Critical Theory Analysis of the YouTube Video ""North America's Next Top Indian Model""",Analyzing YouTube: Multidisciplinary Approaches,,,,Paper,"A Critical Theory Analysis of the YouTube Video ""North America's Next Top Indian Model""",Analyzing YouTube: Multidisciplinary Approaches,"Critical theory looks at understanding the dynamics of power and the creation of inequality based on class, gender, and race and how ideologies and social institutions support this social construction. Critical theory also seeks to understand how social constructions shape and dominate our perspectives; certain institutions in society such as media, religion and schools are used to reinforce power dynamics or social constructions. In early colonial society there was a dichotomy in the representation of First Nation (Indigenous) women, as either a princess or beast of burden depending on the perceived relationship with the colonial settlers, and these representations have persisted to the present day. With the rise in websites such as YouTube for video sharing on the Internet and the easy access to resources to create and upload videos, there is potential for First Nations women to make use of online video websites as an alternate public sphere for representing issues they can not normally address through mainstream media. My presentation uses critical theory to analyze the YouTube video North America's Next Top Indian Model. The analysis provides insight into the ways in which First Nations women are currently using online video to question and challenge the underlying mainstream assumptions about the representation and stereotypical portrayals of First Nations women, and to explore the potential of online videos by First Nations women to represent themselves and to promote social change."
2008-0026,Acting Political and Making It Right: The Performance of Celebrity Activism in post-Katrina New Orleans,Commodity Activism: A Cross-Divisional Roundtable,,,,Paper,Acting Political and Making It Right: The Performance of Celebrity Activism in post-Katrina New Orleans,Commodity Activism: A Cross-Divisional Roundtable,"What roles do celebrities play in publicizing disaster and, in hurricane-devastated New Orleans, in producing a cause for social activism? Celebrities have long engaged in social activism, including for example, Jerry Lewis annual muscular dystrophy telethon and the recent Red campaign by Gap in which consumers purchase commodities as a means of facilitating social change. As this panel contends, activism has itself become commodified so that it involves little beyond buying telephone services or credit card plans (e.g., Working Assets) and corporate-sponsored charitable events (e.g., Race for the Cure, AIDS Walk). Offering a case study of Brad Pitts and Angelina Jolies Make it Right campaign, I argue that self-interest or publicity are no longer easily disentangled from activism. As corporations perform cultural citizenship and globetrotting celebrities emerge as the hope of nations, the rise of celebrity/commodity activism can only be understood as further evidence of the erosion of civic engagement."
2008-0027,"""Active"" Approach to Global Communication Education",Challenges of Teaching Intercultural Communication in Response to Global Changes,,,,Paper,"""Active"" Approach to Global Communication Education",Challenges of Teaching Intercultural Communication in Response to Global Changes,"What practical use does our intercultural education have? Most of the time we ask our students to read Western perspectives on intercultural interactions and administer tests to monitor how well they memorize these perspectives. With globalization bringing people across borders closer to each other, it is crucial to practice skills of understanding and relating to people who were strangers yesterday but became our neighbors or coworkers today. Moreover, more observations suggest the importance of teaching students and professionals to understand not only cultural uniqueness, but also practice processes and principles of intercultural dialogic interaction and learn importance of dyadic adaptation (adaptation not to a culture but to an individual from a particular culture).

Tools to use: (1) through the course of study students should be engaged in constant self-examination to understand their stereotypes, communication styles, and levels of
cultural sensitivity, etc.; (2) invite guest speakers from other countries (e.g., group of international students from campus, international individual working in different organizations); (3) visit culturally-different places (e.g., international grocery stores, ethnic restaurants); (4) co-teach courses with international universities; (5) introduce foreign perspective on intercultural communication (e.g., articles/chapters on intercultural interactions published by international scholars who teach and live oversees); (6) practice communicating with a local community/university oversees (through local chamber of commerce) using free chat rooms or video tools (e.g., AOL. Yahoo, ICQ) to practice real life intercultural communication.

These methods, supplemented by traditional theoretical readings, will surely be more effective in preparing students to deal with globalization challenges of increasing cross-cultural interactions than simply reading about other cultures."
2008-0028,Adapting AND Applying a Western-Developed Model of Condom Use to Chinese College Students,Progress and Perspectives in Communicating About HIV/AIDS,,,,Paper,Adapting AND Applying a Western-Developed Model of Condom Use to Chinese College Students,Progress and Perspectives in Communicating About HIV/AIDS,"The HIV/AIDS epidemic is becoming a very serious health problem in China, and young people are disproportionately affected because they are quickly becoming more sexually liberated. However, the prevalence of condom use remains low. Given the lack of theoretical literature on condom use among Chinese young adults, this study seeks to adapt a Western-developed model to explain condom use in this important Chinese population. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a university in China. Approximately 2,010 students were surveyed to obtain 1875 usable respondents. However, the primary focus of the study was on explaining condom use among the 490 respondents who had had sexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex. Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model.
Preparatory behaviors, including buying condoms, having them available, and discussing condom use with a sexual partner, were the strongest predictors of condom use among the sampled Chinese college students in the model. Chinese students who had more positive attitudes towards condom use, who believed that their parents or friends would disapprove of their having sex without condoms, and who were confident in using condoms in a variety of situations, were more likely to use condoms during sex. The length of a close or steady relationship and alcohol use were also found to be significant predictors of condom use. However, drug use was not a significant predictor.
In summary, the study suggests that the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior, preparatory behaviors as well as situational/contextual factors can help us better understand heterosexual condom use among Chinese young people. Future HIV-preventive and safer sex interventions in China can design and target messages effectively based on the findings."
2008-0029,Adapting Courses to Prepare Students to Communicate for Social Impact,Preparing Students to Communicate for Social Impact in Jesuit Education,,,,Paper,Adapting Courses to Prepare Students to Communicate for Social Impact,Preparing Students to Communicate for Social Impact in Jesuit Education,"In the third topic of discussion (concretized as a position paper), panelists illustrate how they have infused the sentiment of communicating for social impact into entire courses. Jay Leighter discusses how Creighton has refocused its core class (Principles of Communication Competence) toward civic engagement by conceptualizing public speaking as a form of community membership and social justice. He explains how small changes, such as requiring topics to be of significant social consequence, better prepare students to communicate for social impact and discussed changes in the courses master syllabus, teacher training processes and student experiences. Bren Ortega Murphy then details her Community as Text course, which involves community service, ethnographic research and storytelling and culminates with students writing their own childrens stories reflecting the lives of neighborhoods in which they volunteered. She explore the multitude of ways this course encourages communicating for social impactculminating with trying to get the books published and infused back into the neighborhoods that inspired them."
2008-0030,Addiction and Eyes on Screen: How Smokers Process Smoking-Related PSAs,Communication Theory Applied to Health Campaigns,,,,Extended Abstract,Addiction and Eyes on Screen: How Smokers Process Smoking-Related PSAs,Communication Theory Applied to Health Campaigns,"The purpose of this study is to understand how addicted smokers process smoking-related PSAs by looking at fixation duration of eyes on screen, which may suggest resources allocated to visual attention. Smokers (like all addicts) are appetatively activated by images of their addicted substance (in this case smoking and cigarettes). However, with complex stimuli, like PSAs, it is possible that smoking cues will elicit avoidance responses in accordance with the fear appeal literature or that they will elicit overload. Smoking cues in PSAs should be processed similarly to complex stimuli (operationalized in this case as high in Information Introduced (I-squared)) due to the emotional nature of these cues which should call forth significant resources for processing. It is also likely that individual difference variables in addiction to tobacco and sensation seeking will moderate effects. This is research is funded by the National Cancer Institutes Effects of Public Information in Cancer (EPIC) Center of Excellence in Cancer Communication Research, reference number 5P50CA095856-05."
2008-0031,A Digital Bias,The Bias of Digital Communication,,,,Paper,A Digital Bias,The Bias of Digital Communication,"Harold Innis argued that any form of communication possessed a bias; by its nature it was most adept at reducing signaling time and controlling space or strengthening collective memory and consciousness and controlling time. He recognized that the speed and distance of electronic communication enlarged the possible scale of social organization and greatly enhanced the possibilities of centralization and imperialism in matters of culture and politics. We now live in a digital age in which blogging, open source journalism, wikis and other media options democratize and disperse. With to shift to digital media, a new era has been ushered in challenging the conclusions if not the underlying assumptions of Innis work. Convergence is an in-vogue concept recently applied to the coming together of a variety of media through the platform of the computer and digitalization thereby transforming it into an instrument capable of transmitting and receiving sound and image simultaneously and serially. The daily lives of individuals are experienced in multiple and diverse psychological and social zones. Increasingly we function across overlapping and simultaneous boundaries of place  some physical, others mediated, some public, others private. The ecology of place has been altered, irrevocably changed, with more and more of our psychological time spent in non-place settings. Innis studied the social history of communication, examining the communication media of the last 4000 years. This paper will explore the media landscape which followed that history and examine the applicable bias of digital communication."

Measures include adolescent smoking and other psychosocial variables including sensation seeking, verbal argumentativeness, verbal aggressiveness, religiosity, peer pressure, peer smoking behavior, parental monitoring, family relationships, delinquent behaviors, and academic performance. Middle school students (N = 260) from two schools in the northeast participated in the study. The results indicate peer smoking behavior, weak family relationships, delinquency, and poor academic performance predict adolescent smoking behavior. Implications of these findings are discussed."
2008-0033,*Adolescents' Exposure to Sexually Explicit Internet Material and Notions of Women as Sex Objects: Assessing Causality and Underlying Processes (Top 4 Paper),x and the Media,,,,Paper,*Adolescents' Exposure to Sexually Explicit Internet Material and Notions of Women as Sex Objects: Assessing Causality and Underlying Processes (Top 4 Paper),Sex and the Media,"The aim of this study was to clarify causality in the previously established link between adolescents? exposure to sexually explicit internet material (SEIM) and notions of women as sex objects. Further, the study tried to assess initially which psychological processes underlie this link. Based on data from a three-wave panel survey among 962 Dutch adolescents, structural equation modeling revealed that exposure to SEIM and notions of women as sex objects had a reciprocal influence on each other. Adolescents? liking of SEIM fully mediated the influence of exposure to SEIM on their beliefs that women are sex objects, as well as the impact of these beliefs on exposure to SEIM. The results specify and extend previous findings of how adolescents? exposure to SEIM is related to the formation of sexual beliefs."
2008-0034,Adoption and Use of Computer-Based VoIP Phone Service: Toward an Integrated Model,Psychology of Technology Adoption,,,,Paper,Adoption and Use of Computer-Based VoIP Phone Service: Toward an Integrated Model,Psychology of Technology Adoption,"This study examines the factors that influence the adoption and use of computer-based VoIP phone service and attempts to integrate two theoretical approaches: the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the uses and gratifications framework. Using data from an online survey of users of the new technology (N = 309), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that perceived ease of use of the technology had a significant impact on perceived usefulness as suggested by the TAM. In addition, perceived usefulness had a positive effect on attitude toward using the technology. The study further discovered that motivations for communication and instrumental use played an important role in affecting perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude toward using computer-based VoIP phone service. The current study suggests that integration of the TAM and the uses and gratification approach can be a fruitful method for understanding user acceptance of new communication technologies."

Although courts have been quick to dismiss the application of free speech standards to copyright disputes, the proper relationship between these two areas of the law is less than clear. The paper explores the received understanding of the intersection of free speech and copyright, largely derived from the work of Professor Melville Nimmer. It analyzes the difficulties with two specific doctrines by which the Supreme Court has justified copyrights free speech immunity  the idea/expression dichotomy and the fair use doctrine. Finally, the paper offers some suggestions for an alternate approach to this difficult area of the law."
2008-0036,"Advertising, Consumer Activism, and PR in the 1930s",A Century of Struggle: The Tug of War Between Social Activism and Corporate Public Relations,,,,Paper,"Advertising, Consumer Activism, and PR in the 1930s",A Century of Struggle: The Tug of War Between Social Activism and Corporate Public Relations,"The 1930s witnessed the emergence of a feisty consumer movement intent on democratizing consumer information. Much to the advertising industrys horror, consumer activists were winning support for their demands to regulate advertising on the federal level. Before long, that battle between consumer activists and advertisers had evolved into a larger ideological battle over commercial values and their role in defining society.
Concerned that the consumer movement would be able to build substantial support, the advertising industry adopted a wide range of public relations strategies to beat back its demands and create an alternative discourse for the discussion of consumer issues.
The PR strategies were very successful and we are presently living with the ramifications of the historical battle. However, as discontent with advertising and commercialization are again on the rise, it is worth knowing that the battle is not entirely lost; just obscured thanks to ongoing public relations efforts."

Findings indicate that individuals are likely to act in the form of voting for legislation supporting the cause advertised by the corporation. However, individuals are not willing to act in the form of purchasing products from corporations who advertised their corporate social responsibility initiatives. The study also focused on the advancement of the third-person effect theory by examining behavioral intentions and suggests further refinement of the measurement of the reverse of the third person effect, namely referred to as a first person effect."

Psychological empowerment is situated in the wider theoretical context of Narayans empowerment framework (2005). A specific framework is then developed for psychological empowerment in a development context, which builds on Zimmermans nomological network for psychological empowerment (1995). The framework is tested by analysing the level of psychological empowerment among listeners of Afghan Womens Hour. Findings indicate that AWH is able to enhance listeners capacity to aspire, by giving them ideas about specific goals. It is also able to enhance their perceived ability to influence, and perceived efficacy."

The paper discusses how this 2 step framework is related to fundamental research on survey methodology and real world estimation. To illustrate the importance of the second step, the study offers an empirical statistical test of heaping on multiples of five (Roberts & Brewer, 2001). Results indicate highly significant heaping on fivefold numbers in participant responses (N =1251) to all classic first order estimation questions, independent of item domain. The systematic recurring peaked answering pattern is suggestive of a less than perfect quantity representation and/ or estimation capacity of the human mind. Methodological implications for empirical small effect size research with vague 100 point rating scales are examined."
2008-0040,A Framework for Sentiment Analysis of Political News Articles,LSI Approaches to Analyzing Media and Controversy,,,,Paper,A Framework for Sentiment Analysis of Political News Articles,LSI Approaches to Analyzing Media and Controversy,"Sentiment analysis is an important type of text analysis carried out in communication and socio-political studies of media coverage of political events and its impact on society. We present a framework for appraisal and sentiment analysis of political news articles, based on Martin and Whites framework for appraisal analysis. The framework focuses on common types of sentiment, its expression, and its subject and object. We apply the framework to sample news articles on two political figures, US President, George W. Bush, and Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to identify the usefulness and potential problems in using the framework. Adjustments to the framework are proposed to address problems of ambiguity and identification of context-specific aspects of sentiment."
2008-0041,African Coverage of Progress and Responsibility in Fighting AIDS: A Community Structure Approach,Progress and Perspectives in Communicating About HIV/AIDS,,,,Paper,African Coverage of Progress and Responsibility in Fighting AIDS: A Community Structure Approach,Progress and Perspectives in Communicating About HIV/AIDS,"A cross-national frame-building study of AIDS coverage in leading newspapers in twelve African nations compared hypotheses linking national (community) characteristics and coverage, using a community structure approach. A sample of all 250+ word articles on the topic 1999-2006 yielded 1690 articles. A stratified random sample of 20 percent of those articles was analyzed combining article prominence and direction into a single-score Media Vector for each paper.

Two master frames for AIDS coverage were analyzed. Regarding progress frames, eight of twelve Media Vectors were positive. Pearson correlations revealed higher infant mortality rates linked to media emphasis on progress (r = .562, p = .029). For community responsibility frames, all twelve African newspapers manifested favorable Media Vectors. Yet Pearson correlations revealed higher levels of vulnerability (poverty), stakeholders (AIDS incidence) and health access (female and male condom prevalence) all linked to less media emphasis on community responsibility fighting AIDS. Regressions revealed female condom use and AIDS incidence accounted for 83 percent of the community responsibility variance.

The connection between high infant mortality and progress coverage may illustrate a threshold effect: Countries with devastatingly large proportions with AIDS may welcome any progress at all as hopeful. Linking both distress (poverty/AIDS incidence) and hope (female/male condom use) to coverage minimizing community responsibility suggests a similar threshold effect: Any immediate progress is far too little for the enormity of the pandemic, similar to putting a band aid on a tumor. Additionally, increased condom use may resemble less a systematic, comprehensive, statewide effort than the product of a few heroic individuals, physicians, hospitals, unconnected to lasting, institutionalized change."
2008-0042,After Tiananmen: Political Semiotics of Olympic Public Space in Beijing,"Race, Territory, Politics",,,,Paper,After Tiananmen: Political Semiotics of Olympic Public Space in Beijing,"Race, Territory, Politics","Public architecture has always been central to Chinese statecraft. The Beijing Olympics, described by China?s rulers as a landmark event in Chinese history, will unfold in monumental public spaces that have become charged examples of the reconstruction of Beijing since 1978. As Olympic signature sites, the National Grand Theater and the CCTV tower have attracted public debate that can be read as surrogate dissent to the post-1978 reforms. Olympic Green, the built environment star of the Games, is the first official national public space built in Beijing in the half century since the construction of Tiananmen Square. Envisioned as a ?second capital? and commercialized recreational park, the Green dwarfs Tiananmen while embracing a design that discourages political activity. Thus do China?s rulers hope to divert attention from the 1989 massacres forever connected to Tiananmen. But like Tiananmen, the Green is meant to produce and display a public compliant with the regime in power. In the design of the Green, tensions between the glittering surface of authoritarian capitalism and its problematic ecological, social, and economic consequences are symbolically resolved. How citizens will play the role assigned them seems less certain."
2008-0043,Age Differences in Adults Emotional Motivations for Exposure to Films,Top Papers in Instructional & Developmental Communication,,,,Paper,Age Differences in Adults Emotional Motivations for Exposure to Films,Top Papers in Instructional & Developmental Communication,"Participants in three age ranges (younger adults, 18 to 25, N=188; middle adults, 26 to 49, N=92; and older adults, 50 and over, N=93) completed a questionnaire assessing motivations for everyday affective experiences as well as affective motivations for film viewing. In line with Arnetts view of emerging adulthood and Carstensens socioemotional selectivity theory, younger adults expressed the greatest interest in experiencing negative emotions in their everyday lives, in viewing dark, creepy, or violent content, and in viewing media to escape boredom and for amusement; older adults were most interested in experiencing emotional stability and in viewing films with uplifting, heartwarming content. Results suggest that lifespan differences may help explain the allure of hedonically negative programming among some groups."
2008-0044,Agency and Distance in the Representation of Suffering,"Media Terror, Conflict, and Resolution",,,,Paper,Agency and Distance in the Representation of Suffering,"Media Terror, Conflict, and Resolution","This article focuses on the depiction of sufferers and their helpers in newspaper reports of disasters, to examine the extent to which they are depicted as active or passive agents. The implications of the ways they are depicted are considered in the light of theoretical discussions on audiences moral distance from sufferers and in the light of previous empirical research. A content analysis of UK press coverage of the South Asia earthquake in October 2005 and the July 2005 London bombings, provides the basis for a comparative study of how agency is depicted by the media. The results indicate that the agency of sufferers was depicted more frequently in the former than in the latter case. The results are discussed in the light of the importance attributed in the literature to the depiction of agency in constructing sufferers as humane and, on the basis of this empirical research, show that it may not be as significant as has been suggested."
2008-0045,Aggressive Outcomes and Videogame Play: The Role of Length of Play and the Mechanisms at Work,"Violence, Aggression, and Empathy",,,,Paper,Aggressive Outcomes and Videogame Play: The Role of Length of Play and the Mechanisms at Work,"Violence, Aggression, and Empathy","Recent meta-analytic findings (Sherry, 2007) suggest that the effect of violent video games on aggression tends to decrease the longer participants play. Therefore, it is likely that different mechanisms may be at work depending on the length of play. In this study, we employed a 4 (length of game play) X 2 (sex) design to examine the effect of length of video game play on aggressive outcomes. In addition, we examined possible theoretical mechanisms (i.e., arousal, aggressive cognitions, affective hostility) to help explain the link between violent game play and aggression. Findings suggest that arousal may peak after a few minutes of game play, then slowly diminish over time, and that aggression responses may be related to this pattern of fluctuation. Implications for our current understanding of the relationship between video games and aggression are discussed, along directions for further research."
2008-0046,Agreement and Disagreement in Focus: Cultural Perspective on Televised Election Debates,Media Effects on Elections,,,,Paper,Agreement and Disagreement in Focus: Cultural Perspective on Televised Election Debates,Media Effects on Elections,"Nearly everywhere televised election debates have assumed a central role in political campaigning. However, these debates may be quite different in different countries. The whole political system seems to have a marked influence on political discussions on television. Further, the influences of speech culture can also be found in the television performances of politicians. In this paper, the characteristics of Finnish televised election discussions are analyzed. The goal of the paper is to apply the model for televised election discussion developed by Isotalus and Aarnio (2005) and to analyze expressions of agreement and disagreement in two televised election discussions during parliamentary elections. The results confirm the main argument of the model that in a multiparty system the televised election discussion is a discussion, not a debate. Therefore, the basic elements of interaction are not attacks and defenses as in debates, but rather expressions of agreement and disagreement."

This paper examines how expressed agreement and disagreement during online deliberation affects participant evaluations of their experience, including satisfaction, perceived reevaluation of opinions, and expected future participation. Also, the effect of these evaluations on perceived legitimacy and opinion ambivalence are considered. A number of alternative hypotheses are entertained, including a ""balance"" hypothesis that suggests that a balance of agreement and disagreement would yield the most favorable evaluations, a ""sociability"" hypothesis in which high agreement enhances evaluations, an ""avoidance"" hypothesis in which high disagreement reduces evaluations, a ""reevaluation"" hypothesis in which high disagreement enhances evaluations, and a disequilibrium hypothesis that indicates that high agreement with low disagreement and the reverse yield good evaluations. The hypotheses are tested with data from pre- and post-surveys and a discussion content analysis of a representative sample of 179 Pittsburgh residents who participated in a deliberation experiment. Analysis proceeds with confirmatory factor analyses and OLS with non-linear terms and group-robust p-values. Findings indicate that deliberation evaluations are important for decision legitimacy, reported likelihood of future engagement, and decision ambivalence. Also, the sociability hypothesis is strongly confirmed for deliberation satisfaction. The disequilibrium hypothesis is confirmed for future engagement. The avoidance hypothesis is not supported, which weighs against the hypothesis that people seek to avoid disagreements in these political discussions."

Informed by frame theory, I employ textual and content analysis to study twenty-five years of U.S. newspaper coverage of this trend toward early puberty. I conclude that newspapers have framed the phenomenon as one in which girls? bodies have transgressed culturally prescribed dictates of childhood innocence. Moreover, I argue that, while the coverage of early puberty itself, is not necessarily evidence of a specific and unique moral panic, it is part and parcel of a larger and ongoing moral panic about youth growing up too fast."

Although it appears that the increase in prevalence has slowed and stabilized over the last 5 years, there is no evidence that explains why this may be happening. The objective of this study is to present analyses of two national surveys that show the number of HIV infections averted as of 2005 by means of prevention behaviour and the impact that AIDS communication programs have had on HIV prevention behaviour as of 2006. Cross-sectional, nationally representative household surveys were conducted in 2005 and 2006 to measure HIV prevalence, HIV prevention behaviour, and exposure to AIDS communication programs designed to promote prevention behaviour and help people living with HIV. The result showed that exposure to 19 AIDS communication programs had a substantial, monotonically increasing impact on using condoms to prevent HIV infection and eleven other AIDS-related outcomes. Propensity score analysis revealed that the HIV negative status among those who practiced some kind of prevention behaviour would have been 86.2% rather than 90.5% if they had not practiced a 4.3 percentage point difference, amounting to an estimated 718,197 HIV infections averted by 2005, and a 15.3% reduction in HIV infections for an estimated 20-year lifetime savings of this reduction in HIV infections would be US 5.7 billion dollars."

Sexually active females recruited from a sexual disease clinic (N = 407; m. age 18.5 years) completed self-report measures and self-collected vaginal swab specimens to assess STD prevalence and a nondisease marker of unprotected sex. Number of drinking occasions was significantly related to three of four psychosocial correlates and to all self-report measures of sexual behavior. Also females consuming more drinks per drinking occasion were significantly more likely to have Chlamydia and a positive test for the presence of semen in vaginal fluid. Results indicate greater frequency and volume of alcohol are differentially related to adverse psychosocial correlates, self-report and biological markers of sexually risky behavior. Implications for campaign planning and materials and interventions are discussed."

Acupunctures spiritual talk and the larger linguistic ideology of spirituality exist in part as a holistic critique of biomedical theory and biomedical practice/delivery. Spiritual vocabulary is used as a positive descriptor for aspects essential to health but not empirically or physically verifiable. However, some practitioners raised objections to the use of spiritual tags as a way of making unacceptable aspects of acupuncture seem more acceptable. This analysis of spirituality-focused ways of speaking reveals important cultural understandings of not only acupuncture, but also of health and health care more generally."

The review shows that placement characteristics, such as the placements commerciality, modality, and prominence have a strong impact on audience reactions. Audience characteristics, such as attitudes and beliefs about brand placement, advertising, and the medium are also important for audience reactions to brand placement. Theories on source credibility, intentional exposure, human associative memory, and persuasion knowledge explain the majority of the effects. Future research should develop theories on capacity constraints and implicit processing as these can explain brand placement specific effects."

Analysis of their origin and development, ownership, business models and programs, suggests that Phoenix TV is a highly successful, China-oriented, commercial venture. Inspired in part by the worlds most notorious media mogul, yet mostly compliant with a restrictive political environment, the station has transitioned from commercial, corporate ownership to majority ownership by a state-run commercial entity. Al Jazeera started as a hybrid private-state entity, primarily oriented to the Arab and Islamic worlds and secondarily to a larger international audience interested in Arab and Islamic affairs. Its relatively aggressive editorial independence has occasionally alarmed -- in diverse ways -- domestic, regional and international elites. Its increasing commercial clout has been accompanied by notable adoption of British-style (BBC) formatting amid indications of greater state influence or control, at local and international levels, that may undermine its otherwise promising claim to a genuine public sphere function. By 2007 these two stations were converging towards a model of western-style formatting, greater commercial orientation but within distinctive cultural frames. Additional content analysis will help access whether the process of convergence entails enhanced mainstreaming in terms of content. ."

Emotional Appeals, Production Values, and the Presence of Disclaimers in Food and Beverage Advertising","Advertising, Children, and Adolescents: Content and Concerns","Informing children about healthy food choices is important because the percentage of overweight and obese children in the United States has tripled over the past thirty years. A content analysis of the emotional appeals, production techniques and use of disclaimers (or clarifying statements such as part of this nutritious breakfast) in more than 3,800 food and beverage television advertisements was conducted. The Federal Trade Commission directed advertisers to present disclaimers in the dual modality (or simultaneously in the ads audio and video) format more easily understood by children. Results suggest ads in child programs use significantly more emotional appeals and production techniques that young children are more adept at processing. Most disclaimers in childrens programs were not dual modality. Thus ads in child programs likely distract youngsters from attending to disclaimer and product information, hindering their learning about healthy food choices."

The research reported here examines differences in the appropriateness of various motives for anonymous communication in the workplace and then relates that to anonymity use, satisfaction, and key individual and organizational demographics. The findings, based on a survey of adult organizational members, reveal clear differences between the motives and several distinctions in how they relate to the other variables examined in this research. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."

In Hong Kong, several years after the epidemic episode, the ?people?s voices,? as it were, regarding urban spatial politics, governance, and the media have not only grown louder, but have also been profoundly transformed into collective effervescence. This essay is based on over 50 interviews of ordinary Hong Kong residents from a wide spectrum of demographics. A particular focal point of the interviews was, inevitably, the participants? reformulation of their identity as a function of urban crisis. Chiefly a documentation of the vernaculars of public criticism offered by the citizens of Hong Kong, this essay relates post-SARS public sentiments to the (somewhat fiddly) development of democratic ideals that is animating our urban imagination today."

In terms of method, the current study investigated both M&As made by public relations agencies and M&As targeting public relations agencies and compared the M&A frequency of these two categories. The result revealed that although M&As activities in the public relations industry have been increased in the decade between the early 1980s and early 1990s, they began to drop in the early 1990s. Also, it was found that public relations firms acquired or were acquired by other public relations firms."

Such speculation raises a subsequent policy question on whether the vertically integrated broadcast TV networks tend to favor affiliated programs and reduce the programs that are produced by independent producers. This study examines the influence of vertical integration on different owners of primetime programs over time. The time frame of the study encompasses the years prior to and after mergers between broadcast TV networks and Hollywood movie studios. Yearly data on primetime programming and programming schedule of each one week from the years 1993-2006 are analyzed to evaluate any impact of vertical integration on primetime broadcast TV programming.

Marketers have long understood the power of music to gain attention, set mood, and prime listeners for important information. In fact, the mere presence of music in a commercial can alter the meaning of the ad to the consumer. A significant amount of research has been conducted over the years to determine musics effects. One particular area that has been largely neglected concerns the attribute of familiarity. Extant research, what little there is, has demonstrated that familiarity is a significant element in musics relation to advertising. Familiarity becomes all the more important when one considers that commercial music is becoming increasingly prevalent in advertising. Popular commercial music has been, and continues to be, utilized in commercials; however, the costs of using more popular, established music are greater than those of newer, unfamiliar music. This dichotomy of familiar versus unfamiliar music, and its effects on consumer attitudes and behavior, is a subject of increasing import, and worthy of further study."

The present study presents an experimental test of the heuristic-processing model and tests the impact of frequency, recency, and vividness on construct accessibility and social judgments. 223 students participated in a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design varying the frequency of exposure to violent TV programs, the level of vividness in the programs, and the timing of the dependent measures. Dependent measures were accessibility (reaction times) and social reality beliefs. Results showed that reaction times were largely unresponsive to most of the independent variables. Although there were no main effects for frequency on social reality beliefs, there was a significant interaction between frequency and vividness on beliefs: people watching vivid violent media gave higher estimates of the prevalence of crime in the real world in the 3x viewing condition than those in the 1x viewing condition. In concluding, it is argued that this study has important implications for the heuristic-processing model, cultivation theory, and vividness."

Impact was assessed via a pretest/posttest control group quasi-experimental design with Tucson, AZ as the intervention community and Phoenix, AZ as the control. Pre-intervention focus groups provided qualitative data to guide intervention development while telephone surveys in both communities provided quantitative data to assess campaign impact. Analyses reveal pretest/posttest differences in the intervention community such that posttest intentions regarding living organ donation behaviors increased from pretest to posttest. No such differences were observed in the control community. Subsequent analyses revealed differences between respondents in the intervention community exposed to the campaign v. those in the same community not exposed to the campaign. Exposed respondents reported more positive living organ donation behavioral intentions than non-exposed respondents. Implications for research and practice are discussed."
2008-0062,Ambient Intelligence Designers and How Their Assumptions Shape Our Future,Communication and Technology Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,Ambient Intelligence Designers and How Their Assumptions Shape Our Future,Communication and Technology Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"The assumptions that designers make regarding the design and user characteristics of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) applications play an important role in the realization of Ambient Intelligence. This paper presents a qualitative, empirical study of the implicit assumptions that designers have about AmI designs and their prospective users. Twenty-seven AmI designers at four international high-tech companies were interviewed. The qualitative analysis of these results suggests that designers do not exactly know which user needs are fulfilled by their applications. The use of AmI applications in domestic settings could lead to positive consequences such as providing people with more quality time with one another, but also to negative consequences such as leading people to become more apathetic. Based on the results, the designers of AmI applications should reevaluate their assumptions about users and their daily routines."
2008-0063,Ambivalence Amplifies College Smokers Negative Emotional Responses to Antismoking Information,Up in Smoke: Models of Influence in Smoking and Marijuana Use,,,,Paper,Ambivalence Amplifies College Smokers Negative Emotional Responses to Antismoking Information,Up in Smoke: Models of Influence in Smoking and Marijuana Use,"Many smoking college students hold ambivalent attitudes toward smoking. Although ambivalence is widely believed to evoke negative affect, research has yet to examine how ambivalence may influence emotional responses to persuasive information. Participants in this study (N = 133 college smokers) completed a survey which included a presentation of novel and credible anti-smoking information. Structural equation modeling analyses showed that pre-exposure ambivalence was positively associated with post-exposure negative emotions. Negative emotions, in turn, were associated with greater perceived message effectiveness. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed."
2008-0064,American Media Assistance 2.0: The Role of ICTs in United States Government Media Assistance Programs,The Social Impact of Networking the Poor for Development,,,,Paper,American Media Assistance 2.0: The Role of ICTs in United States Government Media Assistance Programs,The Social Impact of Networking the Poor for Development,"Over the last twenty-five years, media assistance programs and policies designed to develop the domestic media sphere of target countries in line with democracy and good governance goals have expanded exponentially. The provision and expansion of new communication technologies is an increasingly central tool in service of these strategies. Access expansion initiatives, internet training programs, streaming video and audio, and internet-based video-conferencing are all being utilized in service of attempts to shape the form and content of target country media spheres in line with development goals. Because media assistance programs are typically de-centralized and administered under the rubric of a wide variety of departments and agencies, the structure and motivations of these programs are equally diverse and at times contradictory. Drawing upon qualitative interviews with policy-makers and an analysis of government reports and policy documents, this paper examines the role of new technologies in American government media assistance programs and presents lessons learned."
2008-0065,A Meta-Analytic Review of Video/Computer Game Play on Short-Term Cognitive Performance,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,,,,Paper,A Meta-Analytic Review of Video/Computer Game Play on Short-Term Cognitive Performance,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,"The objective of the current meta-analyses was to determine a) whether or not video/computer games enhanced cognitive performance, b) which specific cognitive variables are affected by video/computer game play, and c) if any variables moderated this relationship. Fifty-eight studies (contributing 161 effect size estimates) were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that video/computer game play was related to positive increases in cognitive performance, r = .23, p < .00001 for correlational studies, and r = .14, p < .00001 for experimental studies. Positive effect size estimates were also found for specific cognitive variables. Overall, these results suggest that video/computer games (independent of content) may be beneficial to those who play them."
2008-0066,A Mindful Approach to Organizational Learning Theory in Crisis Communication Literature,Multiple Perspectives on Organizational Crisis and Change,,,,Paper,A Mindful Approach to Organizational Learning Theory in Crisis Communication Literature,Multiple Perspectives on Organizational Crisis and Change,"This essay bridges a theoretical gap by connecting current crisis communication literature to rhetorical theories that identify barriers to learning and implementing change. Through a model built on this foundation, the theoretical underpinnings of a movement are presented to include learning throughout the crisis cycle and encourage the adoption of a mindful culture. The opportunities to learn from crisis are discussed. Previous crisis models are described. The literature on warning signals and failures as precursors to crisis is reviewed. An explanation of the similarities between Burkean philosophy and crisis research is presented. And, finally, by focusing on the potential for organizations to learn in each stage of the crisis cycle, the researchers Mindful Learning Model is introduced to demonstrate how, if barriers are overcome, learning can not only lessen the impact of a crisis, but also potentially prevent a crisis from occurring."
2008-0067,A Model of Deviance in Small Groups,Problems and Possibilities in Group-Based Organizing,,,,Paper,A Model of Deviance in Small Groups,Problems and Possibilities in Group-Based Organizing,"Groups are ubiquitous in human social life and especially so in organizations. Oftentimes, for managers and employees, being a good team worker means being able to integrate the group without difficulty and without disturbing its way of working. Such wishful thinking is regularly thwarted by reality where conflicts and deviance are a common part of group life and its dynamic. Even though small groups have been largely studied, we still know very little about how deviance as a process emerges and unravels in small groups and the study presented here constitute a step toward a better understanding of this process.
Through the in-depth analysis of the emergence of a deviant role within two workgroups we elaborated a model of deviance in small groups. The model shows three important moments of the process, each moment including two or three propositions. These three moments  initial context, emergence of the deviant role and maintenance and reinforcement of the deviant role  are time markers and they point toward structuring moments of group life regarding deviance. The model we developed fits well with previous literature on the topic and the next step would be to be verified or refined it in other settings and on a larger scale."
2008-0068,A Multilevel Analysis of Cancer Risk Perception,Risk Perceptions and Fatalism in Health,,,,Paper,A Multilevel Analysis of Cancer Risk Perception,Risk Perceptions and Fatalism in Health,"This paper focuses on the relative influence of individual versus community effects on risk perception. The study is grounded in literature examining how individuals manage information and make risk judgments in the context of suspected environmental cancer threats. We focus on three individual-level perspectives: the psychometric model of risk perception, an adaptation of the heuristic-systematic information processing model, and cancer anxiety. We also evaluate five sets of community-level variables that frame cancer cluster investigations: demographic, epidemiologic, sociologic, etiologic, and pathologic. Data were collected through a mail survey of 30 communities in which cancer cluster investigations were being conducted. Response rates averaged 43%, with 1,111 records in the final dataset. Through multilevel modeling and other techniques, the results show that the individual-level model developed in previous work remains a robust description of risk perception in these cases. However, the analysis also shows that the community-level measures neither improve the individual-level model nor offer any substantial explanatory power of their own. We provisionally conclude that, within the context of cancer cluster investigations, risk perception is a phenomenon located in a common psychological dimension that is substantially independent of contextual influences. We also suggest that risk communication efforts in this specific context might successfully draw from a common approach informed more by individual than community factors."
2008-0069,A Multitheoretical Network Perspective on Organizational Member's Information Retrieval From Human and Digital Knowledge Repositories,Current Research on Network-Based Approaches to Organizational Communication,,,,Paper,A Multitheoretical Network Perspective on Organizational Member's Information Retrieval From Human and Digital Knowledge Repositories,Current Research on Network-Based Approaches to Organizational Communication,"The goal of this study was to theorize and empirically test network models of organizational member?s information retrieval from their colleagues and digital knowledge repositories (e.g. intranets and databases). Based on the Multi-theoretical Multilevel (MTML) framework (Contractor, Wasserman & Faust, 2006; Monge & Contractor, 2003), this study applied and extended 3 social science theories (transactive memory, public goods, and social contagion) to examine team members? information retrieval networks. Empirical data were collected from 9 organizational work teams in Western Europe. A cutting-edge social network analysis technique, Exponential Random Graph Modeling/p* analysis, was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results found that team members had the greatest tendency to retrieve information from those colleagues whom they perceived to be knowledgeable and accessible. In addition, team members? information retrieval from digital knowledge repositories was greatly influenced by social contagion effects. As one of the original research using a multi-theoretical perspective to examine multidimensional information retrieval networks, this study has important implications for theoretical development, methodological applications, and managerial practices."
2008-0070,An Active Education: Classroom Participation as an Influence on Intergroup Relations among Parents,Bridging Divides to Develop Community: Investigating Intergroup Relations Among Urban Residents,,,,Paper,An Active Education: Classroom Participation as an Influence on Intergroup Relations among Parents,Bridging Divides to Develop Community: Investigating Intergroup Relations Among Urban Residents,"Research indicates that new immigrant and African American parents often feel some disconnection from their childrens educations, though these disconnects may emanate from different sources. This paper describes an intervention project in two Crenshaw schools that brought African American and Latino parents into the classroom to complete hands-on science projects with their children. While the primary goal of the project was to increase parental comfort and engagement with teachers and curriculum content, the program also provided ongoing opportunities for intergroup relations. The workshops provided parents with opportunities to interact across group lines as concerned parents, rather than as members of different racial/ethnic groups. Data presented in this paper draws from pre- and post- intervention interviews with parents and field notes of interactions observed within the workshops."
2008-0071,Analysis of Influences on the Production of Visual War Coverage,Visual Communication Studies Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Extended Abstract,Analysis of Influences on the Production of Visual War Coverage,Visual Communication Studies Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"Our research project focuses on the socially and politically relevant issue of visual crisis and war journalism. Especially war coverage plays an important role within the general political coverage. It influences the process of personal opinion formation and further on it affects political decisions and their acceptance. We want to explore what factors have an impact on the production of visual crisis and war journalism. Due to practical research reasons we focus in our study on photojournalism. In this special case of visual journalism we are able to reconstruct a one to one relationship between the media product and the producer.
The complex research subject requires a combination of methods. Our research project is located in the fields of visual communication, biographical research and biographical media research. The employed procedure is designed in accordance to these disciplines and includes both the interpretation of images and the biographical analysis."
2008-0072,Analysis of Spectacularization as Social Interaction in YouTube: Broadcast Yourself,Mass Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,Analysis of Spectacularization as Social Interaction in YouTube: Broadcast Yourself,Mass Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"With the advent of the Internet, the notion of spectacle has been transformed in practices of reception of cultural consumption and social interaction. You Tube: Broadcast Yourself, as matrix of spectacularization, is a clear example of how the Internet imposes new forms of social interaction, reception and production of meaning in notion, form and content of spectacle to which are added the characteristics of cultural industry. Through a pragmatic semiotic study of textual construction and reception the categories of spectacularization as social interaction in the You Tube site may be analysed, along with the mechanisms of cultural and technological interaction produced by spectacles. These include the shift from public to private (and viceversa: moebius culture); instantaneity and de-territorialization; the spectator as producer, editor, censor and protagonist; the trivial, the ephemeral, realist fiction, scandal, voyeurism, exhibitionism and superficiality; contextual nomadism in the process of production, distribution, consumption and socialization: indeed, the spectacle as self-production: the spectacle is you.

You Tube: Broadcast Yourself constructs an individual and collective matrix of spectacularization as social interaction immersed in the logic of cultural and spectacle type industry which is expanded by the Internet. The analysis shall emphasize that the problem of spectacularization in contemporary culture is due to and constructed from textual conversation through the exercise of a near-mediatic interaction of the user as producer and editor of texts of himself, of others and of the other."
2008-0073,An Analysis of Interspecialty Communication at Admission Using the Leximancer Program,ghts Into Intergroup Dynamics of Communication in Health Contexts via Leximancer,,,,Paper,An Analysis of Interspecialty Communication at Admission Using the Leximancer Program,Insights Into Intergroup Dynamics of Communication in Health Contexts via Leximancer,"This study represents an exploration of how Leximancer can be applied in the analysis of intergroup communication between health professionals in the tertiary hospital context. We draw on research which applies the framework of communication accommodation theory (CAT) to understanding the nature of interspecialty interactions during the course of patient hospital admissions. The data comprise interviews with medical practitioners from multiple hospital specialty departments. We conducted an automated lexical analysis of 48 interviews, and used the findings to guide a subsequent CAT-based manual analysis of intergroup communication strategies and behaviours. This paper discusses both the advantages and difficulties of using Leximancer in this context and describes strategies for conducting intergroup analyses using this software."
2008-0074,An Analysis of Religious Identity Presentation on Facebook,Faith in the Media: Religion and Popular Communication,,,,Paper,An Analysis of Religious Identity Presentation on Facebook,Faith in the Media: Religion and Popular Communication,"Social networking websites, such as MySpace and Facebook, have in recent years become indispensable for large numbers of young people in the United States as tools for self-presentation and for communication with their peers. Concurrently, scholars have been drawing attention to the important yet paradoxical position of religion in the lives of young people. In light of these two trends, this study examined how religious young adults express their religious identities in their social networking website profiles, and what guides their disclosure of religious identities in such profiles. Applying principles of grounded theory (Strauss & Corbin, 1998), the study relied on interviews with five undergraduate students, all of whom were members of a religious campus group affiliated with a conservative Christian denomination, and all of whom were Facebook users. Results indicate that these young people do not label themselves as Christians in their profiles, but reveal their religious identities in the context of their activities and relationships. Furthermore, in composing their Facebook profiles, the students are guided by an overarching concern for presenting themselves in a moderate light. They strive to be perceived as moderate Facebook users and as moderate Christians. These results align with existing knowledge about online self-presentation and young peoples religious identification."
2008-0075,An Analysis of the Convergence Policy in Korea Using Actor Network Theory: Why is Convergence in Korea Delayed?,ternational Convergence Policies,,,,Paper,An Analysis of the Convergence Policy in Korea Using Actor Network Theory: Why is Convergence in Korea Delayed?,International Convergence Policies,"Drawing upon qualitative data from stakeholders in convergence in Korea, this study traces the process of convergence in terms of technology, regulation, and policy, and examines how the stakeholders interests are aligned and coordinated in the process of convergence in Korea. Using actor network theory, the study relates the socio-technological construction of Koreas strategy for convergence reform. Key research questions are: (1) What strategy has Korea adopted, and (2) What social and technological elements have influenced strategy formulation, and (3) How different interests have stabilized ideologies in which actors formulate their strategies based on their interests. Despite the dynamics of interactions, the actor-network around convergence has not been effectively stabilized yet, as the politics of convergence is complex and marked by paradoxical features. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding why the convergence discussion in Korea has so far failed."
2008-0076,An Automated Approach to Measuring Linguistic Intergroup Bias on the Web,cholar to Scholar: Intergroup Communication Interest Group Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Extended Abstract,An Automated Approach to Measuring Linguistic Intergroup Bias on the Web,Scholar to Scholar: Intergroup Communication Interest Group Interactive Paper Poster Session,"This paper presents a method to automatically measure linguistic intergroup bias on the Web. The method uses freely available software to establish associations between generic linguistic intergroup bias indicators and designated socio-cultural groups implicitly made by authors on the Web. The research builds on a prior study that tentatively showed that linguistic intergroup bias can be validly assessed from random Web sources using simple search engine techniques. The current study more systematically assesses linguistic indicators of social proximity in a more international setting. In particular, the study investigates linguistic intergroup bias on the Web toward ethnic, and also toward non-ethnic, social groups in both the United States (expressed in English) and in the Netherlands (expressed in Dutch)."
2008-0077,An Empirical Study Investigating Instant Messaging as an Enabling Tool for Education,formation Technology In (and Out of) the Classroom,,,,Paper,An Empirical Study Investigating Instant Messaging as an Enabling Tool for Education,Information Technology In (and Out of) the Classroom,"This paper describes an empirical study on postgraduate students in a local university to investigate whether instant messaging (IM) tools are used as enabler tools for learning in tertiary institutions. We first developed a theoretical model based on the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM). We then undertook a survey of 104 postgraduate students. The findings indicated that external factors such as technology utility, network externality, media influences, self-efficacy and affection have a significant effect on perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). In our study, PEOU has significant influence on the students acceptance of IM tools as enabler for learning, contrary to past research result of PU influencing acceptance intention. Overall, the findings suggested students perceptions of IM tools are easy to use and useful in the context of learning. The paper concludes with a discussion on implication to education."

Based on cognitive- affect - behavior framework, this research emphasizes on cultural identification, second language acquisition, mass media consumption and social interaction with the host people. Specific characteristics of Chinese communication among different Chinese groups and social systems will be taken into account. This research elaborates the dynamics and further provide a integrate framework for acculturation."
2008-0079,An Empirical Study of the Control Mechanism of China's Internet Censorship,Communication and Technology Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,An Empirical Study of the Control Mechanism of China's Internet Censorship,Communication and Technology Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"While the Chinese government sees controls as necessary, they also recognize the Internets role in economic growth. Though many scholars have noted that the Chinese Internet is centralized and hierarchical, few have attempted primary research on the workings of Chinas Internet censorship system, particularly from the technical point of view. Instead, most studies have assumed the hierarchical nature of controls and focused narrowly on the blocking of Websites and key terms regarded as politically sensitive by Internet censors.
This paper establishes the use of diverse and sophisticated multi-level filtering techniques, as well as hierarchical controls, by Chinese authorities to coordinate the blockage of Internet access in China, primarily relying on technical testing in fourteen Chinese cities. The paper also concludes however that the effect of Chinas Internet censorship remains limited, as most well educated Chinese people can use various effective means to circumvent the Internet control."
2008-0080,An Empirical Test of the EPPM While Promoting HIV Tests: Does Trait Reactance and Sensation Seeking Moderate the Models Predictions?,Predictors of Sexual Risk Behaviors and Screening: Implications for Health Communication,,,,Paper,An Empirical Test of the EPPM While Promoting HIV Tests: Does Trait Reactance and Sensation Seeking Moderate the Models Predictions?,Predictors of Sexual Risk Behaviors and Screening: Implications for Health Communication,"The present investigation tested the extended parallel process model (EPPM) for state reactance following exposure to fear-appeal messages promoting HIV testing. Results from the structural model revealed that a perceived threat of not getting an HIV test was associated with a perceived threat to a personal freedom. As hypothesized, perceived efficacy was not associated with a perceived threat to freedom. Contrary to expectation, perceived efficacy was negatively associated with a classic boomerang effect and positively associated with source expertise. Following existing research, a perceived threat to a freedom was associated with state reactance, while state reactance was associated with a classic boomerang effect. State reactance was not associated with source evaluations (expertise, sociability, and trustworthiness) or related- or vicarious boomerang effects. Finally, regression analyses revealed that trait reactance, sensation seeking, and a trait reactance X sensation seeking interaction explained a significant amount of variance in the outcome variables alluded to above. The results have theoretical and practical implications for both the EPPM and HIV testing among young adults."
2008-0081,An Ethnic Hierarchy of News Effects,Race and the Media,,,,Paper,An Ethnic Hierarchy of News Effects,Race and the Media,"In light of troubling ethnic disparities in the United States, this study explores the manner in which ethnicity may moderate the association between news exposure and social capital. A series of expectations are honed with reference to distinctiveness and identification theories, as well as research on ethnic news portrayals and ethnic variance in media effects. News exposure is measured in terms of newspaper and local television news, and social capital with the following two indicators: organization membership and auxiliary relationship. OLS regression analysis indicates an ethnic hierarchy of news effects on social capitalfrom Whites (who benefit the most) to Latinos to Asians to Blacks (who benefit the least). Consistent with the studys expectation, the effects of news exposure on social capital indicators are more beneficial for Whites than minorities. Furthermore, Blacks benefit the least, even less so than Latinos and Asians, and Latinos benefit more than Asians."
2008-0082,A New Expression of the Public Interest? The Case of the Public Service Publisher,Reconfiguring the Public,,,,Paper,A New Expression of the Public Interest? The Case of the Public Service Publisher,Reconfiguring the Public,"The concept of the public interest has played a major role in the development and implementation of media policies, regularly serving to justify policy initiatives and providing a yardstick against which these initiatives can be measured. Measures ranging from the US 1934 Communications Act to recent UK government proposals on the regulation of media ownership have been predicated on a commitment to protect the public interest. Yet the phrase itself contains multiple interpretations and contradictions, in particular between a populist, ratings-led conception of media responsibility and one distinguished by its determination to develop instruments to protect citizens from the domination of both state and corporate domains. This tension is evident in recent debates concerning the British media regulator Ofcoms proposal for a Public Service Publisher (PSP), an important new venture aimed at commissioning public service broadband content in the digital age. By taking advantage of the participative and decentralized features of social media, its proponents argue that the public interest can be safeguarded and nurtured in a media future. This paper examines these arguments, reflects on the changing definitions of the public interest, and considers the extent to which the PSP proposal expresses an especially individualized and privatized notion of mediated activity carried out in the public interest."

This study tests a self-categorization explanation of female influence. Male and female participants (N = 269) listened to a tape of a female speaker who used either tentative or assertive language under conditions that led participants to categorize the speaker in terms of her gender, or as a college student. All participants judged the tentative speaker to be lower than the assertive speaker on agentic traits. There was no evidence that women were differentially influenced by the speakers linguistic style, or by the categorization. Men were more influenced by the tentative speaker when she was categorized as a woman than when categorized as a college student. This effect was partially mediated by mens collective self-esteem. Men were more influenced by an assertive than tentative speaker when the speaker was categorized as a college student. This effect was fully mediated by perceived similarity to the speaker. The findings are discussed with reference to the glass ceiling phenomenon."

With two contrasting foci, senders and receivers culture-oriented planning, tourism public relations practitioners have difficulty deciding what to emphasize on their countries official websites. Hofstedes cultural dimensions were used as a schematic to examine the differences in the way each country delivers its website contents. A three-step analysis process was used to demonstrate where each country places emphasis and what leads to difference in sales performance. The results and discussion sections provide guidelines for establishing systematic public relations strategies that may result in growth of sales."
2008-0085,An Examination of the Communicative Behaviors and Digital Divides Among the Deaf,Digital Inclusion and Exclusion,,,,Paper,An Examination of the Communicative Behaviors and Digital Divides Among the Deaf,Digital Inclusion and Exclusion,"Recently, the Internet and web-enabled technologies provide persons with disabilities with increased media access and use opportunities. However, the foci of the bulk of Internet research have been on adult Internet use, with relatively less research on those with hearing disabilities who may be affected by crucial social, economic and technical barriers to digital informational use. This paper discusses and examines how Deaf persons use media and communication technologies in their daily communication ecology, the relationships between Deaf persons online and offline communicative behaviors, and the factors affecting their computer and Internet use, based on recent fieldwork among Deaf college students. Results show that Deaf students use a variety of communication technologies of which mobile devices were most frequently used. Despite the availability of these technologies, face-to-face communication was still the preferred option by many Deaf persons. Results also show that the online and offline behaviors were not strongly related to each other, therefore suggesting that communication technologies may be a substitute rather than a complement to existing modes of communication and point to future research implications to better understand persons with disabilities."

Contributing to an understanding of international public relations ethics, this study offers a Chinese perspective on ethical decision-making. Research results of the study help tease out seven specific cultural values that have influenced Chinese peoples ethical decision-making. It also shed light on the ways in which these identified cultural values have affected Chinese peoples moral reasoning and ethical decision-making. Exploratory in nature, the study suggested a tentative model helpful for ethical decision-making in the Chinese context. Public relations professionals can benefit from this study by gaining a deeper understanding of the ethical issues implicated in Chinese peoples relationship building and decision-making."
2008-0087,An Investigation Into the Role of Image Repair Theory in Strategic Conflict Management.,"Disappointment, Despair, and Image Repair: Crisis Communication in Public Relations",,,,Paper,An Investigation Into the Role of Image Repair Theory in Strategic Conflict Management.,"Disappointment, Despair, and Image Repair: Crisis Communication in Public Relations",A content analysis was conducted of media releases and media reports relating to a series of sexual assaults at the Air Force Academy in 2002 to investigate the effectiveness of image repair strategies and the usefulness of contingency theory perspectives in crisis management. The study found that communicating during crises is a dialectic process where the conflict of the situation serves to change the perspectives of the institution and the media as the crisis proceeds. Findings also suggested that a proactive approach was most effective in generating positive media coverage. Bolstering was the most effective image repair strategy while apologizing was ineffective. Looking at crises as something that can be managed ignores the complexity of crisis situations. The study suggests a complexity approach to crises might better prepare communicative entities to deal with a crisis.

Media Effects, Public Opinion, and Public Diplomacy in Europe and the Middle East",Understanding the Impact of Media Exposure on the Effectiveness of International Public Diplomacy,"In response to a rise in anti-American sentiment in the Middle East and other regions of the world, the United States has embarked on revitalizing its public diplomacy efforts targeting foreign publics through a range of mass media initiatives. The basic premise of these initiatives conceptualizes anti-Americanism as a communication problem exacerbated by negative portrayals of the United States and its policies in foreign mass media, especially television news. This paper evaluates this premise in both the Middle East and Europe by both examining the content of six prominent television news stations for three months in 2005 and employing survey data from the same time period to test the association between exposure to these same channels and anti-American sentiment. Though the content analysis demonstrated that both European and Arab TV news were highly critical of the United States, there were important differences in which aspects of the United States they each critiqued. In addition, the survey data suggests that negative portrayals of the United States in European and Arab TV news are associated with higher levels of anti-American sentiment among foreign publics. The implications for U.S. public diplomacy and media strategy are discussed."

Semi-structured interviews with 31 post-first generation successors found that the successors were simultaneously influenced by a multitude of factors with the most salient among them being a combination of one?s family, part-time employment in the business, and realistic job and organizational expectations. There was a strong overlap of VAS and OAS factors in the work socialization of young successors leading to their eventual decision to choose a career in their family business. Directions for future research are discussed."
2008-0091,Antiracist and Multicultural Discourses in European Public Broadcasting,"Race, Territory, Politics",,,,Paper,Antiracist and Multicultural Discourses in European Public Broadcasting,"Race, Territory, Politics","Public debate on multiculturalism heated up in most European countries in the 2000s. Many countries, the Netherlands and Denmark in particular, which have been known of their multicultural and tolerant policies towards ethnic minorities began to tighten their immigration and minority policies. This paper aims to analyze European multicultural discourses by focusing on a critical analysis of the media prize Prix Europa Iris, the yearly awards competition that celebrates multicultural television programming in Europe. Although submissions are received from independent filmmakers, public broadcasters and commercial television, public broadcasting corporations play key roles in the organization and definition of the event. In this paper I examine how the jury reports and speeches define and signify multiculturalism and anti-racism. These statements help to influence multicultural media policy throughout Europe. Policy can be analyzed as a crystallization of values and definitions. The paper tackles these key questions: What kinds of discourses of multiculturalism and anti-racism are expressed? How is multiculturalism defined? How is Europe and European identity presented? How are these definitions and positions limiting and opening up possibilities for minorities?
The paper concludes that recognition of minority identities and status does not necessarily lead into inclusion. Multicultural media initiatives, such as the Prix Europa Iris, have fundamental problems. Increased recognition and intercultural exchange do not solve problems of marginalization, instead marginalization and recognition of ethnic identities co-exist in the contemporary Europe."
2008-0092,An Urban Communication Audit: Measuring Aspects of a Communicative City,"High Density Session: Exploring Methods, Measures & Analyses",,,,Paper,An Urban Communication Audit: Measuring Aspects of a Communicative City,"High Density Session: Exploring Methods, Measures & Analyses","Treating metropolitan areas as information or communication systems is not novel, but our approach has generally focused on aspects of communication rather than the whole. Recently, the Urban Communication Foundation has focused on cities and the extent to which their planning, programs and use of technology encourage the type of social interaction that strengthens ties and is functional for urban areas. This paper is an attempt to apply the concept behind the ICA Communication Audit to urban communication systems, mapping out the turf and providing a sample of measures. When we talk about the communicative city, were referring to a community whose environment facilitates development of a communication system that integrates its residents into a dynamic whole, that enables its citizens to get involved in civic activities and participate in a variety of roles, and makes possible a balance between mobility and stability. To identify how well a community matches this picture, we need an inventory of the citys communication activities and its relationship to the urban environment."
2008-0093,Anxiety and Uncertainty Management in an Intercultural Setting,tercultural and International Public Relations,,,,Paper,Anxiety and Uncertainty Management in an Intercultural Setting,Intercultural and International Public Relations,"This study extends the research on organization-public relationship in public relations by incorporating the Anxiety and Uncertainty Management Theory (AUM) in intercultural communication. Specifically, this paper examines whether relationship cultivation strategies (i.e., access, positivity, openness, legitimacy, shared networking, and sharing of tasks) in public relations relate to anxiety and uncertainty management, and whether such management results in effective communication and desirable relational outcomes. Data were from a random sample of 175 international students from 32 countries in a southern U.S. university. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Results indicated that cultivation strategies have both direct and indirect effects on relational outcomes; uncertainty, anxiety, and effective communication were significant mediators to relational outcomes. The proposed model and an exploratory model based on the data were discussed, as well as the implications."

In Study 1, we derived an operationalization that taps the true meaning of sexual objectification as described by Fredrickson and Roberts. Our Study 1 results suggest that pictures of women with a high degree of body display (i.e., wearing little clothing) were perceived by college women to be sexually objectifying, and in Study 2, we found that these images affected the types of words women used to describe their appearance. Study 2 also revealed a significant condition X trait body surveillance interaction, whereby women who were categorized as high in body surveillance and who were exposed to the body-display condition reported more self-objectification than all others."
2008-0095,A Position Paper on the Use of a Case-Scenario Approach for Understanding Diffusion of Innovations,Methodological Advances in Communication Technology Research,,,,Paper,A Position Paper on the Use of a Case-Scenario Approach for Understanding Diffusion of Innovations,Methodological Advances in Communication Technology Research,"The fundamental problem of understanding the adoption and use of new information and communication technologies is that potential users are not familiar with them. Consequently, it is hard to ask people if and how they would use these services and applications.
In this paper we discuss a methodology that makes it possible to judge the suitability of the use of new information and communication services while taking into account: [1] characteristics of the technology, [2] the context of the user and [3] user characteristics. Using the basics from factorial survey, vignette studies and conjoint measurement we will discuss the design issues of such a study as well as the data-analysis issues that have to be dealt with. Furthermore, we will describe an example of a typical study that uses this case-scenario approach. We conclude that the method supports the development of an innovative theoretical framework regarding the adoption and use of new information- and communication technologies."
2008-0096,A Postwar Settlement for U.S. Broadcasting:,"Public Participation, Public Expectations",,,,Paper,A Postwar Settlement for U.S. Broadcasting:,"Public Participation, Public Expectations","During the postwar 1940s a media reform movement of grassroots activists and a progressive Federal Communication Commission (FCC) emerged to challenge the commercial interests consolidating control of US media. A key initiative borne out of this movement was the so-called Blue Book, a high-water mark for FCC progressive activism that mandated social responsibility obligations for broadcasters in return for their state-sanctioned monopoly control of radio spectrum. Ultimately, policy initiatives outlined in the Blue Book were defeated by red baiting tactics and the media reform movement was largely contained. This outcome helped solidify a postwar settlement for U.S. media, which defined medias role in a democratic society as primarily serving commercial profit imperatives with nominal social obligations to the public. Henceforth, these public interest obligations would be regulated largely by media industries themselves, beyond state or community oversight. The following analysis draws from a wide range of trade press coverage, secondary historical accounts, and previously unexamined archival materials to illuminate and contextualize the normative debates and politics underlying the Blue Book controversy."
2008-0097,Applying the Attitude-Social Influence-Efficacy Model to Condom Use Among African-American STD Clinic Patients: Implications for Tailored Health Communication,Predictors of Sexual Risk Behaviors and Screening: Implications for Health Communication,,,,Paper,Applying the Attitude-Social Influence-Efficacy Model to Condom Use Among African-American STD Clinic Patients: Implications for Tailored Health Communication,Predictors of Sexual Risk Behaviors and Screening: Implications for Health Communication,"The purpose of the current investigation was to apply the Attitude-Social Influence-Efficacy model to achieve a theory-based understanding of condom use among low income, heterosexually active African-American STD clinic patients. This study is the first step in a line of research to develop a computer-based tailored health communication intervention to promote condom use with this high-risk population. 293 participants were recruited from a large, publicly-funded metropolitan STD clinic in the Southeastern United States and surveyed using an ACASI computer program. Results indicated that: 1) individuals were more motivationally ready to use condoms consistently with casual than main partners; 2) Those in early stages of change (e.g., Precontemplation, Contemplation) tended to lack positive condom attitudes, had few positive social influences surrounding condom use, and had interpersonal skill deficits and low self-efficacy compared to those in later stages (e.g., Action, Maintenance); 3) Participants rated the ACASI program highly on ease of use and liking, indicating their willingness to use computers for health-related assessment. Implications focus on the development of a computer-tailored health communication intervention to promote condom use among this high-risk population."

Individuals responses to questions about acceptance and usage of Cyworld were collected and combined with various factors modified from the Technology Acceptance Model. The results of this study show that user perceptions are significantly associated with their motivation to use Web2.0. Specifically, participation and involvement are found to have significant effect on users motivation. These new constructs are found to be Web2.0-specific factors, playing as enhancing factors to attitudes and intention."

Processing Coactive Motivational Media Messages,"High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Motivation, Emotion, Mood & Affect",,,,Extended Abstract,Approach? Avoid? Both? Processing Coactive Motivational Media Messages,"High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Motivation, Emotion, Mood & Affect","This paper examines the physiological, cognitive, and emotional responses of participants while viewing messages which are increasingly emotionally positive, negative, or both negative and positive. It is expected that the emotional content will activate either the aversive, the appetitive, or both motivational systems which should predictably influence resource allocation, cognitive effort, encoding, and storage. Motivational activation will be measured using probe reflex measures (PAR for appetitive activation and startle magnitude for aversive activation). Valence and intensity of emotional experience will be measured using self report, facial EMG, and skinc conductance. Cognitive effort will be assessed using HR. Encoding and storage will be measured using recognition and cued recall respectively."
2008-0100,Approaching Immigration Debates Through the Lens of Race,Communication Research in the U.S./Mexican Border Region,,,,Paper,Approaching Immigration Debates Through the Lens of Race,Communication Research in the U.S./Mexican Border Region,"News coverage and policy discussions of immigration operate within traditional zones of legitimate controversy. However, journalists, pundits, and public officials often conflate debates about policy with moral panics about difference, especially as Latina/os are constructed as the face of undocumented immigration in the United States. This paper suggests that scholars return to the problematic of race as a productive place to begin to flesh out the different issues emerging in immigration coverage. This paper offers an intellectual history of the notion of race and racial difference in Communication, and offers a criticism of how U.S. national news media operates within racial discourses even when seemingly avoiding questions of difference. This paper argues that in times when categories of difference are scattered about by narrowcasting and hybridity, the power of race discourses can help unravel the political and the cultural in public issues."
2008-0101,"Approaching Social Change as a Complex Problem in a World That Treats it as a Complicated One: The Case of Puntos de Encuentro, Nicaragua",Theory for Activism and Social Change,,,,Paper,"Approaching Social Change as a Complex Problem in a World That Treats it as a Complicated One: The Case of Puntos de Encuentro, Nicaragua",Theory for Activism and Social Change,"In spite of the growing recognition of social change as a non-linear, long term, and often-unpredictable process requiring efforts at multiple levels, most organizations continue to frame their strategies in measurable, cause-effect terms as if their programs could be isolated from other efforts, and could demonstrate effectiveness in the short-term. Rarely traditional tools, models and frameworks question the linear assumptions guiding social change processes. Puntos de Encuentro, a Nicaraguan feminist non-profit organization, is implementing an innovative approach to designing communication strategies to foster social change. This case study uses Complexity Sciences principles as a framework to analyze Puntos de Encuentros communication strategy and to explore some of the emerging critics to the traditional communication for social change theories and evaluation methods. The findings suggest that Puntos has intuitively applied basic principles of Complex Systems in its work and it is mindful of several of the Complexity Science tenets: history and context dependency, non-linearity and paradoxes, the supremacy of the whole over the sum of its parts, the relevance of the quality of the relationships and interactions, the benefit of decentralized control for order emergence and self-organization, and the importance of a free, diverse and participatory flow of meaningful information for the system to change and evolve. The authors conclude that a communication for social change approach framed in Complexity-based concepts can be an alternative to our array approaches to promote change."
2008-0102,A Preliminary Study of the Interfirm Network of Wireless Mobile Media Business in the U.S.,Mobile Media,,,,Paper,A Preliminary Study of the Interfirm Network of Wireless Mobile Media Business in the U.S.,Mobile Media,"This paper explores the structural properties and mechanisms of a small set of inter-organizational links between firms involved in the mobile media services in the U.S. Guided by network exchange and resource dependency theories, this paper explores how firms from telecommunications, media and technology sectors establish ties with one another to access and offer important resources, and how the structural roles and interdependence of these firms are associated with their sectorial affiliation, business models and performance. A sample was compiled for the dominant companies in the sectors of network operators, media content providers, equipment manufacturers and IT enablers which have had business operations in the U.S. for a five-year period from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2005. The data analysis reveals several preliminary patterns in the mobile media business. The overall sectorial difference between firms explains a low percentage of ties in the network. The revenue status of firms is weakly associated with their tendency to form ties across sectors, but is more strongly associated with their structural power in the network. Media firms do not seem to have a more diversified and dense network pattern, and have no relatively stronger structural power over other sectors of industries. Wireless carriers, in comparison, are more likely to hold certain broker roles in the network, and have overall stronger structural power that is measured in between-ness and exact power measures. Policy implications are discussed and future research directions are suggested."

In fact, the purpose of some of the most popular websites  such as Facebook and MySpace  is to increase ones social network. Reporting the results of a survey of 507 undergraduates, this study finds that social networking use was positively associated with online bridging and bonding, but on the whole, these gains did not translate into offline contexts. Facebook intensity, defined as using relatively more of the social networking functions of the site, was associated with gains in offline bridging and bonding. In addition, being motivated to use social networking websites for their intended purpose  to stay connected to others  was positively associated offline social capital, but using them to bolster ones public image was negatively associated with it. Discussion focuses on the implications of online social capital."
2008-0104,A Relational Turbulence Model of Experiences of Hurt in Premarital Romantic Relationships,Hurtful Communication and Violence,,,,Paper,A Relational Turbulence Model of Experiences of Hurt in Premarital Romantic Relationships,Hurtful Communication and Violence,"The authors use the relational turbulence model to derive hypotheses linking characteristics of relationships and reactions to hurtful messages from a romantic relationship partner. It was hypothesized that relational uncertainty and perceptions of goal interference and facilitation from a partner predict perceptions of relational turbulence, which in turn predicts the intensity of hurt feelings, negative emotions, the perceived intentionality of hurt, and perceptions of worthlessness and uncertainty evoked by the situation. Participants in a web-based survey (N = 381) completed measures of relationship qualities and recorded responses to five hypothetical scenarios that described their romantic partner delivering a potentially hurtful message. As anticipated, relationship uncertainty and interference from a partner predicted increased relational turbulence, whereas facilitation from a partner was associated with less turbulence; relational turbulence significantly predicted all four reactions to hurtful messages. The discussion highlights implications for the relational turbulence model and research on the experience of hurt."

The Moderating Effect of Ad Relevance on Consumers Attitude Toward Ads and Websites,Online Persuasion,"The primary goal of this study is to examine how relevant ad contents to the task moderate the relationship between ad types (pop-up ads and square ads) and consumers attitude toward ads and websites. Furthermore, this study provides a theoretical model that explains consumers negative responses to Internet ads aroused by ad types could be offset by relevant ads. Through a web experiment (N=104), the study tested a moderating effect of ad relevancy and a mediating effect of annoyance and banner blindness influencing upon consumers attitude toward the ads and websites. In the experiment, participants were instructed to imagine that they plan to travel to Alaska during summer vacation and assigned a task to find the best deal for a two-night stay at a local hotel at Alaska from the website that was created for the study. While browsing the website, participants were exposed to either pop-up ads or square ads which contain relevant information (e.g., a good offer for hotel) or irrelevant information (e.g., a good offer for a book sale). This study found a significant main effect for ad type and relevance, and an interaction effect between them. Interestingly, the results show that the level of annoyance was reduced when pop-up ads contained relevant contents to consumers tasks. In addition, the annoyance was proved to be mediating between relevancy and ad type, and attitude toward ads. Limitations and the implications for future study would be discussed."

Some aspects of relationships can be managed but total relationship management with clients or with other organisations is becoming very difficult. Relational exchanges take place with many parties and relational expectations change as each relationship develops or declines.

This paper discusses findings of an Australian qualitative study where 16 public relations consultants and 16 of their client relationships were explored resulting in the development of relational parameters for best practice. The findings point to the need to adapt to clients and organisations changing needs and make sense of exchange complexity and uncertainty so as to be aware of partners relational interpretations and understandings. Relationships are multilayered and multifaceted with many different characteristics making relationship management challenging and demanding. This paper contends that public relations relational theory needs to reflect the volatile nature of relational exchanges in contemporary public relations practice thereby advancing relational theory as multi-way relational sense making directing public relations planning and management."

As expected, cognitive inoculation treatments produced more cognitive counterarguments while affective inoculation treatments produced more affective counterarguments. Surprisingly, the study also found that participants rated affective counterarguments as significantly stronger than cognitive counterarguments. Results indicate that affective counterarguing does occur and that subjects feel significantly stronger about affective counterarguments than they do about cognitive counterarguments."

I selected 21 persuasion effects experiments from meta-analytic samples including studies investigating the persuasiveness of narrative versus statistical evidence or of conclusion omission. Of these experiments I analyzed the dialectically relevant components from a pragma-dialectical perspective, leaving out of consideration other aspects that could be relevant. I observed and classified potential threats to the studies internal validity as identified from the perspective of pragma-dialectical theory. These threats entail confounds to the manipulation of the independent variable through undesired variation of (I) a wrong dialectically relevant feature, (II) a dialectically irrelevant feature. The results demonstrate that the pragma-dialectical framework can identify the theoretical gap in operationalizing persuasion variables, suggesting consistent application of one uniform theory could take away the contested inconsistency of results in persuasion effects research."

In particular, the study examines arguers editorial standards. 201 participants completed a survey containing standard mesaures, and also responded to two separate situations which used the Hample and Dallinger (1987) editorial standards instrument format. Each of the situations was designed to respect Johnsons (2002) distinction between personal and public topics. Bivariate correlations showed that communication apprehension is positively associated with concern for effectiveness, truth, and self-image. Verbally aggressive respondents are also concerned with effectiveness, but avoid editing based on truth or relational issues. Argumentative respondents make more principled objections to various arguments, but seem disinclined to worry about person-centered matters. Since these three variables are intercorrelated, multiple regressions show somewhat different patterns. Argument realism, intended as a manipulation check, is a serendipitous discovery. Argument realism has important relationships to endorsement and editorial behaviors. Participants reacted quite differently to public versus personal argument topics, reinforcing Johnsons claim that these must be carefully distinguished in research and theory."
2008-0110,A Roles Approach: Modeling Individual and Cultural Differences in Conflict Strategies,An Eclectic Mix of Topics in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,A Roles Approach: Modeling Individual and Cultural Differences in Conflict Strategies,An Eclectic Mix of Topics in Intercultural Communication,"This paper proposes a roles approach to conflict strategies. Individuals in a conflict are considered to enact both general and situated roles of themselves and to respond to the other persons role behaviors. Obligation from the general role is proposed to explain both individual- and cultural-level differences in conflict strategies by constraining individuals embracement of their situated roles and by altering the relative importance of goals. The other persons negative violation of role expectation is proposed to predict relational disruptive conflict behaviors through anger. The current roles model contributes to the communication literature by 1) identifying an aspect of the relationship that may result in greater focus on relational concerns than conflict issues, 2) isolating the predicting effect from the general relational and cultural variables, 3) integrating both motivational and reactive conflict processes, and 4) capturing the communicative nature of conflict situations."

While Habermas found the ideal bourgeois public sphere in the 18th century British coffee houses, this paper examines the liquid public sphere in Chinathe public bathsand tells a short history of the bathing practice in China. Although often done behind a closed door, the history of baths can be read as symptomatic of many larger social, cultural, political, economical changes. This paper tackles Chinese baths from three anglesliquid, nudity, and communicationas three types of media that connect people in baths at various levels (physically, imaginarily and symbolically). This paper then reconsiders the relationship between the body and communication: While truthful communication is always associated with the pain of the body (Foucault fearless speech; Peters witnessing), does enjoyment necessarily corrupt communication? Can pleasure generate truthful or ethical communication? What role does collective pleasure play in the formation of a public sphere?"

The results of this study employing content analysis found there were noteworthy differences between portrayals of male and female Asian Americans as depicted by mainstream magazine advertisements. Female Asian Americans (especially young adults) were significantly overrepresented in advertisements because of their exotic, sensual, submissive images. Female Asian Americans were likely to be depicted as servants, waitresses, or stewardesses. Whereas male Asian Americans were most commonly shown in business settings, female Asian American models were most frequently shown in outdoor settings, followed by in business and social settings. Asian American models were considerably underrepresented in home settings. Male Asian American models were more likely to be shown in minor roles than in major roles. Female Asian American models, however, were more likely to appear in major roles than in minor roles."

Due to the cross-cultural situation of these reception contexts and their mission of purveying cultural product for personal and social edification over and above entertainment value, these films often take on an implied ethnographic function in its more general sense of communicating one culture for another. This paper places several South East Asian ""art"" films from Vietnam and Thailand in dialogue with the critical politics of representation of visual anthropology, in order to complicate an area of cultural production whose artistic and liberal-humanistic pretexts often discourage critical image analysis. In particular, the analysis draws parallels between the visual tropes of classical and more recent ethnographic film and video with those of the art film genre as represented in this regional grouping in order to highlight cultural and thematic affinities such as the representation of ""material paucity."" These themes are then linked with a sociological analysis of taste, organized around the concept of cultural capital, in order to draw connections between an assumed consumer of what I term ""arthouse ethnographies,"" ultimately placing the Asian art film within a wider historical framework of commodified alterity and culture collecting through the visual."

The factors influencing blog maintenance intentions of American bloggers and Chinese bloggers are collected through in-depth interviews, longitudinal and cross-sectional surveys. Based on the survey of existing literature dealing with anxiety, the big-five personality traits and through blog studies, a structural model have been proposed to explain American and Chinese bloggers blog maintenance intentions. The structural model is based on the assumptions that cognitive factors (blogging self-efficacy, positive outcome expectations for blogging, and negative outcome expectations for blogging), blogging anxiety (i-Anxiety), and general anxiety tendencies (online neuroticism, writing anxiety and social anxiety) affect one another and therefore help in predicting blog maintenance intentions. The original contribution of this dissertation research is in the application of social cognitive explanations of anxiety to the realm of computer-mediated communication."

This set of concepts has been developed as a model in a series of previous studies; the potential effect of hazard proximity is a newer concept introduced here. Data for the study come from a series of 22 mail surveys (n = 797) conducted in 2002-2004 within U.S. communities that had requested investigations of cancer rates due to concerns over local environmental point hazards such as landfills or industrial sites. To spatially enable the data, respondent street address locations and hazard point locations were geocoded. Locations were subsequently georeferenced to an average location in a novel spatial data transformation that facilitates a generalized analysis across the set of surveys. Several visualization and spatial statistical techniques are applied to the data, including cluster analysis, raster surface interpolation, and Geographically Weighted Regression. Results show that while the effect is modest, distance has a significant independent effect on risk perception in which risk perception declines with increasing distance and is on average greater to the east of the point hazard. Similar results are found in an analysis of an information processing and anxiety model in which localized estimates for slope coefficients and R2 values are shown to be spatially conditioned on direction and distance, with some nonlinear effects present. The study concludes by pointing out that spatially integrated models have the potential to greatly improve our understanding of risk perception and communication."

Effective communication across different language groups requires accurate translation. Translation quality involves two factors, the technical and the linguistic. This paper examines the quality of translation of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose technical translation procedures are credible. Thus, it focuses on how culture intervenes in the translation process. The study demonstrates the application of semantic network analysis and spatial modeling as methods to examine translation equivalence. The results suggest that seven different linguistic versions of the Declaration (six official languages and Korean) are roughly equivalent but with subtle differences reflective of each languages cultural predispositions. The paper concludes by discussing the importance of translation and language issues for intercultural communication."

To this end, a total of 101 of the top-grossing box office films theatrically released from 1990 to 2005 were assessed. The results showed that males outnumber females by a ratio of 2.57 to 1. This imbalance has not changed over the last fifteen years. The way in which the sexes are presented in general audience content is also skewed. Females are more likely than males to be portrayed as young or in a traditional light (i.e., less likely to work, and more likely to be in a committed relationship or a parent). The sexes also differ in their personality traits. When compared to their male counterparts, females are more likely to be shown as smart, good, and beautiful."

Specifically, this study assessed key elements of the lower division interpersonal communication course: knowledge of concepts and principles, development of interpersonal skills through verbal and written activities, and understanding of various interpersonal contexts. A course-embedded assessment strategy was chosen to utilize multiple direct and indirect measures.
Results revealed that a significant decrease in communication apprehension accompanied completion of the course; participants reported fewer motives for interpersonal interaction at the end of the term than at the beginning of the term; and students appear to have mastered knowledge of relational communication to a degree that allowed for similar judgments and understandings across the course sections. Moreover, results of the behavioral skills measure suggest that students exit the class reasonably skillful in the topics covered in the course."
2008-0120,Assimilation and Contrast in the Hostile Media Effect,Exploring Media Bias,,,,Paper,Assimilation and Contrast in the Hostile Media Effect,Exploring Media Bias,"Recent empirical research has vividly demonstrated the hostile media effect  the tendency for individuals highly involved in a controversial issue to see media coverage of that issue as hostile to their own point of view. Several explanatory factors have been proposed for this contrast effect, including perceived reach of the message, characteristics of the source and extremity of partisan attitudes. To test these factors, we recruited partisan respondents who were either Native American or sympathetic to Native issues. Participants (N=152) read information, varying in apparent circulation (low, medium and high reach) and source (friendly vs. not friendly) characteristics, on the issue of genetically modified wild rice, a controversial topic for Native people in the upper Midwest. Variations in reach produced a linear trend in judgments of bias in the predicted direction. However, overall evaluations tended toward assimilation rather than contrast effects, and previously unexamined dimensions of partisanship produced surprising and provocative results."

Yet, XX (in press) argued that IC is absent from communication research, is not examined from discursive and theoretical perspectives, and its sociohistorical context is neglected. As such, with support from IC law and the literature on interaction, XX used structuration theory to re-conceive of IC as unfolding amidst the nexus of contradictory societal and historical structures (or systems of meaning)representing groups (physicians, states and administrative entities, patients) interests in controlling ICs meaning and ideal practice. This study examines one arena of social actionpractitioners interpretive schemesfor evidence of the (re)productions of these structures."

In order to approach Japanese censors perspectives on censorship in colonial Korea, articles that they wrote will be analyzed as well. This study is significant in that it is a basic attempt to make a close investigation into the characteristics and perceptions of Japanese censors in colonial Korea. This is a practical analysis of the nature of the censor who plays an important role in prior restraint."

However, only the results from the completed pre-test were shown in this paper. The pre-test was done to come up with reliable items of question by removing those items that decreases the reliability of the study. As shown in the Results section, the items related with Hallyu, national image, brand equity and the flow into Hallyu showed high reliability. And Chinese were more interested in Korean dramas and movies than any other Hallyu contents. In the area of national image, they showed a positive response toward Korean economy and society. However, the degree of flow into Hallyu was not significant."

To do this, we explore lifestyle factor structures and examine to what extent the factor structures found in the cities show similarities across the cultures. In addition, comparisons are made between the preference of domestic dramas and the preferences of regional and U.S ones. The data were collected from parallel surveys on 2,110 participants. First, it is found that whereas some core lifestyle factors such as individualism-collectivism, extroversion-introversion, family value, and sacred marriage are shared across the cities, others such as money first, health consciousness, respecting tradition, work ethics and planned life were revealed unique to some cities. Second, there is some support for the cultural proximity hypothesis, finding that the domestic dramas are preferred to regional ones in all the cities, and regional to the U.S ones in Beijing and Hong Kong. Finally, despite the accentuated differences in lifestyle factors, shared lifestyles anchored in core cultural values account for the favorability toward domestic and foreign dramas. The findings are discussed in terms of the roles of value-oriented lifestyles in foreign media use in the region of East Asia."

Of the total population, 28% speak Basque (euskara). Basque Radio Television has two television channels on the air: ETB-1, which broadcasts in Basque, and ETB-2, in Spanish; moreover, there are two satellite channels, ETB SAT and CANAL VASCO. The Basque media have played a key role in normalizing the use of the language in all areas of life (sports, culture, politics, etc.), which had previously only been spoken at home until the end of Franco´s regime (1975). EITB has been a driving force behind all types of cultural, musical, artistic and theatrical activities and undertakings. It has specifically led to the creation and development of an audiovisual production industry, which did not exist prior to Basque autonomy."

Using the example of a failed religious mini-series, Revelations, I discuss why such an overtly theological series was essentially doomed, because it did not fit with mainstream ideas of lived religion. In contrast, successful dramas like CSI, Law and Order, and House M.D. support the kind of mainstream, non-sectarian faith that is characteristic of contemporary America, as I show using a combination of textual interpretation and audience analysis. While such shows are not popular specifically because of their depiction of faith, I argue that to be successful in the mainstream, a particular take on faith, eschewing both atheism and religious extremism, is essential."

Fortunately, the standard story goes, the unmitigated hubris of early cybernetics was soon tempered with more sophisticated conceptual approaches and improved computing technology. [B]y the late 1970s, one commentator notes, cybernetics had died of dry rot (Kelly, 1994: 354). However, cybernetics was not only a scientific theory; it was also a public knowledge. Its key works were published as mass-market paperbacks, its proponents were well-recognized public intellectuals, and its ideas circulated frequently in popular print media such as the Atlantic Monthly, Scientific American, and Time. Cybernetics produced a veritable lexicon of Williamsian keywords, including information, communication, control, feedback, and the very term cybernetics itself. This paper suggests that in order to understand what I assert is the ongoing impact of cybernetics as a cultural ethos in societies of control, we need to examine its widespread circulation in public discourse. I look to the popular founding texts, their reviews, general press coverage of the theory of cybernetics, and its associated popular culture representations to analyze how cybernetics came to mobilize certain metaphors and imagery, how it defined a vocabulary, and how, in offering a universal metaphysics at a particular historical juncture, it captured the American and global imaginations with ongoing effect."

The current study seeks to advance a third study type by offering a theory of political campaign media connectedness (PCMC). Four axioms are offered in this work. In addition, a series of hypotheses involving four political communication campaign information outlets (conservative political talk radio, debate viewing, newspaper use, and local TV news use) are posited. This work emphasizes the need to study how various information outlets function in coordination with one another to produce a potentially diverse set of direct and indirect political campaign media effects. Future lines of theoretical inquiry and empirical research are outlined."

While the transmediated nature of television is not new, Simpsonian proliferation is becoming more common, and numerous creators such as The Simpsons Matt Groening are now penning television across media platforms, at the very time at which much television now comes to us not via television, but through iPods, computer screens, DVDs, and DVRs. Thus, I pose that such developments require us to expand our notions of media and television studies object of inquiry, foregoing our fetishism of the box and its images to instead examine television across media.

Research has shown that as participants pay close attention or experience long-term, tonic shifts of attention, heart rate should slow down. However, due to the fact that the heart is innervated by both the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympatethic nervous system, cardiac deceleration also can be interpreted as a decrease in physiological arousal. Even when arousal is measured, the use of heart rate as a measure of controlled attention often is challenged. The current study was designed to clarify this point by systematically manipulating controlled attention. Participants are provided with overt instructions to modify their levels of attention to either watch normally or pay close attention as they watch 18 60-second clips of a television program. Within these 18 clips, an equal number have been pretested for content valence as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. The current study is designed to provide further evidence that controlled attention to a mediated stimulus leads to cardiac deceleration."

In an experiment, participants watched two television dramas, and responded to an auditory cue. Secondary task reaction times (STRT) are used as indicators for available cognitive resources. Results show that STRTs are not related to overall narrative engagement nor its subscales Emotion, Attentional Focus, Being There and Narrative Understanding. Suspenseful scenes slow STRTs, while emotional scenes do not."

Results indicated that the Japanese participants relational solidarity with their most frequent contact was positively predicted by their linguistic comfort with English and the Americans communication accommodation. In addition, relational solidarity positively predicted the participants cognitive and behavioral attitudes toward Americans in general. Furthermore, relational solidarity mediated the relationship between the intergroup communication variables and the cognitive and behavioral dimensions of intergroup attitudes. Results were discussed in light of the contact hypothesis and prior literature in intergroup and intercultural communication."

Hypotheses were derived from theories of social identity, self-categorization, similarity-attraction, and communication accommodation. To test models of personal attraction and social attraction, a convenient sample (N = 185) of undergraduate students from a large mid-western university reported on a recent, initial interaction with a same-sex, different ethnic partner. Overall, the findings indicate that the processes of personal and social attraction are, for the most part, different. Specifically, different generative processes were found to exist for personal attraction (i.e., personal identity salience → perceived similarity in attitudes and communication styles → personal attraction) and social attraction (i.e., social identity salience → ingroup identification → social attraction). However, personal attraction and social attraction both predicted engagement in the communication accommodation strategy of discourse management. Given these findings, recommendations for future research are offered."

There is also experimental evidence that these causal claims lead do different attributions. Based on these findings as well as the attribution theory, this research examines whether the publics attributions about obesity lead to policy preferences. Consistent with the predictions of the attribution theory, the results suggest that people are more likely to prefer supportive policies and less likely to prefer discriminatory policies when external and uncontrollable attributions are made. The implications for health journalism and campaign communication are discussed."

When examining group-serving biases and group-based emotions as well as individuals categorization of the perpetrator and their perception of average Americans categorization, the results indicated that although social identity theory provided explanations for some of the findings, other findings may require different explanations. That is, in addition to the effects of social identity categorization on attribution and emotion, individualism-collectivism characteristics of US and Korean cultures and saliency of the incidence might have played a part in affecting attribution and emotion. More detailed discussion is provided in the paper."
2008-0136,A Two-Dimensional Theory of Esteem Support Messages,"Emotion, Well-Being, and Self-Esteem",,,,Paper,A Two-Dimensional Theory of Esteem Support Messages,"Emotion, Well-Being, and Self-Esteem","Self-esteem is one of the most widely studied concepts in the social sciences (Cast & Burke, 2002; Gecas, 1982) and is associated with individuals emotional, physical, and relational well-being (e.g., Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Gecas & Burke, 1995; Rosenberg, 1986). Limited literature indicates that adults self-esteem, personal well-being (e.g., mental and physical health), and relational well-being (e.g., relational satisfaction, commitment, and stability) may be positively influenced by the receipt of effective esteem support from others (e.g., Carels & Baucom, 1999; Cutrona, 1986). Esteem support may be best understood as a particular form of social support that is provided to others with the intent of enhancing how they feel about themselves and their attributes, abilities, and accomplishments. However, very little research considers the character of esteem support messages. To address this lacuna in the literature, this paper develops a theoretical model of esteem support messages. In particular, it outlines (a) theoretical dimensions or categories that characterize better and worse esteem support messages; and (b) the mechanisms through which various message features affect the well-being of recipients. Pragmatic and theoretical implications of the theory are discussed."

The four types of empathic communication according to this typology are: decoding affective information, encoding affective information, decoding cognitive information, and encoding cognitive information. A brief description of each type of empathic communication was provided. Because the first type of empathic communication, decoding affective communication, received most of the attention in this line of research, a subsequent literature review was done on the antecedents and consequences of affective empathy as a decoding process. In conclusion, the typology developed in the current study needs to be validated. Furthermore, this typology is only a first step toward establishing a systematic and comprehensive framework for investigating empathy as a communicative act."

There seem to be two main reasons: First, in the current mediascape, intertextual, producerly engagement with media is increasingly possible for many people, and the fan seems the most active exemplar. Second, because this complex kind of activity is hard to grasp ethnographically, self-identified fans become groups whose practices are most easily studied. While welcoming this move, I also wish to question an over-eager embrace of fandom as a surrogate for typical media audience practices. While such active media participation is indeed a growing reality, I believe it is still relatively uncharacteristic of most peoples mediated practices, and we should not lose sight of the continued need to study more mundane, if less ethnographically-accessible, forms of mediated activity."

The key argument is that contemporary social and cultural lives are becoming increasingly audienced and performed and that many activities in ordinary life are changing due to the ever-growing importance and salience of the media. Such changes involve people forging new ways of belonging, where among other things they seek to distinguish themselves from others in many different ways. The paper will argue further that analysis of audience and media processes, such as fandom and identification from the point of view of communication and media studies needs to brought into a more extensive dialogue with more sociological research that has sometimes taken a more quantitative approach."

Exploring a range of theories on the public sphere and agnostic democracy, including the work of Habermas, LaClau and Mouffe, and Howarth, the author seeks to place mobile design in a broader context of citizenship and public interaction, considering how these might be enhanced through technology and design process. The author takes the discussion to the level of spatial theory (considering Laclau, LeFebvre and Massey), to investigate further Lev Manovich?s intriguing suggestions about the possibilities for social interaction and art in mobile spaces. Led by the work of Howarth and Manovich, the paper contrasts the role of space and possibilities for subjectivity within Internet vs. mobile spaces, suggesting that the distinctive, hybrid time-space dimensions of the formed might facilitate interactive social communication in the latter. The paper provides as examples projects and methods from the mobile design project Portage, examining how its assumptions, design practices and prototypes both mimic and embolden agonistic practices, and seek to privilege both the user desire and process itself. As such design methods are both metaphorically and practically set up as example for a social architecture of agonist, participatory democracy."

While the proliferation of amateur pictures of breaking news events feeds into journalisms dependence on the reality-effects of photographs to sell news, the creation and distribution of these vernacular images typically takes place outside the ethical standards and institutional control of professional journalism, raising questions of their authenticity. The paper uses a series of case studies, including recent uprisings in Burma and combat soldiers posting private images from the Iraq war on YouTube, to discuss how non-journalistic sources disseminate images for different purposes (resistance, oppression, profit). What criteria do news editors employ when assessing the authenticity of these images? How are such images framed, and what implications do they have for the ways in which journalism guarantees the veracity and news-value of its stories?"

However, its potential in non-democratic societies is largely unrealized. The paper argues that democracy need not be a precursor to public deliberation. Instead, public deliberation may flourish as a viable alternative to the radical electoral democracy in authoritarian or semi-authoritarian countries like China. The project of public deliberation, the author suggests, can be broadened in ways to account for the practices in such transitional societies and increase the degree of democratization. The paper draws on Western theories of public deliberation and discusses the characteristics of Chinas deliberative experience. Online deliberation in both Western and Chinese societies is also considered as an extension of offline activities."
2008-0143,Authority in Communication,The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,,,,Paper,Authority in Communication,The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,"Authority is claimed to be a fundamental category governing and monitoring the process of communication, a category of meta-communicative type. The basic role of authority is to distribute the axiomatically unequal roles of communication partners (individuals or institutions). Authority embraces both the right to speak and positive or negative outcomes of communicative (inter)actions.
Authority belongs to the communicants but is conveyed within messages. Discursive markers of authority can be singled out both in verbal and non-verbal messages. There is also immanent authority of the medium itself since the medium is the message (printed vs. written, written vs. oral, etc.).
Discursive markers of authority are viewed on the example of politics, science, and business. Direct markers refer to persons with authority or in power, brand names and titles of nobility. Indirect markers are displayed in the text through comparisons, universal truths, stereotypes and the like. Authority of the source is distinguished from the authority of the message. The latter is a secondary type of authority attributed to culturally relevant texts (the Bible, Quran, the Constitution). Thus, direct markers of an authoritative source in science include quoting from classics and leading contemporaries. Indirect markers in advertising or politics might include reference to folk-tales or legends as authoritative sources for this or that culture, etc.
Authority is also related to dialogical basics of communication, since, first, authority presupposes the obligation to be a responsible speaker, and, second, there is always a response (action, or action through thought or word) to authoritative speech."

This paper will report on the results of a controlled experiment in markets and prices that uses a virtual world as its experimental environment. The virtual world was constructed specifically to host this experiment. It is a Dungeons-and-Dragons-type fantasy world using a lore based on the works of William Shakespeare. The choice of a fantasy environment (as opposed to something more mundane, like a supermarket) was intentional. Many researchers are now using fantasy-based virtual worlds in their research. There has been criticism that human behavior inside fantasy realms does not generalize to the real world. This study is directed primarily at testing virtual worlds against that criticism."

Yet there have been very few theoretically-driven efforts to understand adolescents decisions on that front and a near-absence of investigations that gather data about specific, just-completed interactions. This investigation applies a newly-developed theory of information management (the Theory of Motivated Information Management; Afifi & Weiner, 2004) to better understand adolescents avoidance in conversations with a parent about the parents relationship. Because of the known impact of divorce on parent-adolescent conversations, we also compare divorced and nondivorced families on their experience of these interactions. One-hundred and twelve parent-adolescent dyads, divided almost equally between divorced and nondivorced families, participated in the investigation. Results generally support the utility of TMIM in this context and expand our knowledge of parent-adolescent relationships by showing important similarities and differences between divorced and nondivorced families experience of these interactions."

Empathy as an Intervention Technique in Violent Video Game Play

Abstract
To date, hardly any research on the effects of violent video games focused on intervention techniques to reduce aggressiveness in adolescents and young adults. The present study attempts to fill this void by focusing on empathy as a possible means to reduce aggressive responses among young adults. Young adults (N = 70) were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions (focus on aggressor only, vs. focus shifts to adult-victim or child-victim). After exposure, an indirect measure of aggressive behavior was taken and participants completed a questionnaire. Results showed that the intervention (shifting the focus from the aggressor to the victim) significantly increased empathy with the child-victim, even when controlled for other variables (e.g., age, education level, gaming experience). However, the respondents aggressive behavior was not affected by the intervention and males generally showed a stronger tendency for aggressive behavior than females did. It is promising for future studies in intervention techniques that a subtle focus shift in a single video still can already increase empathy."
2008-0149,Back to the Future?,The Ethics and Aesthetics of Authenticity in News Images,,,,Paper,Back to the Future?,The Ethics and Aesthetics of Authenticity in News Images,"The notion that new media are filling the role traditionally played by morning newspapers has been raised repeatedly as private images fill the news hole and allow immediate or simultaneous updates on news stories as they are being reported. Clearly these media are changing the ways in which images can be tailored to particular journalistic agendas. Such was the case with the video of Saddam Hussein's hanging, which circulated without sound in an official version but with sound -- replete with taunts, jeers and chaos -- in a private video circulated shortly thereafter. How are such images changing the journalistic landscape? What is the relationship between images provided by news organizations and those made available by private citizens? This paper considers the implications of simultaneous updates of news stories through personal cameras and their effect on traditional journalism."

Based on Balance Theory, it was predicted that the more similar employees are to their workplace friends in avoided work-related topics, the more satisfied they would be with their jobs (H1a) and the more similar employees are to their workplace friends in shared work-related topics, the more satisfied they would be with their jobs (H1b). Also based on Social Information Processing Theory, it was predicted that the greater the job satisfaction of their workplace friends, the greater the job satisfaction of individuals would tend to be. One hundred twenty employees from three different organizations in Korea completed the questionnaire. The data were not consistent with the hypotheses. Implications and limitations of these findings were discussed."
2008-0151,Balancing Perception: Electronic Color in Experimental Video Art,Visuals From an Artistic Perspective (High Density Session),,,,Paper,Balancing Perception: Electronic Color in Experimental Video Art,Visuals From an Artistic Perspective (High Density Session),"Color has been a contentious issue in art and aesthetics from the Greeks to the present. Regardless of the particular argument, however, color is always a matter of control, with attitudes falling on either side of a polemic. While on one hand, in classical aesthetics, color is rejected and degraded as impure, on the other hand, in contemporary thought, color is celebrated as the ideal transgression of reason and the ecstatic play of aberrancy, affect, and sensation. I argue here that in order to critically discuss color in new media art, an approach that balances these two extremes must be accomplished.

This third approach uses the notion of diagrams to decode color in compositions. This paper transposes this third sensibility onto various examples of electronic media art, including the work of Steina and Woody Vasulka; Peter Campus; General Idea; and Pipilotti Rist in order to articulate a language of electronic color in new media art. I conclude that these examples successfully honor both the aesthetic qualities of affect and sensation, and also the epistemological and cognitive relations color hold to technical media."

Using a combination of historical analysis of the brands remediation and content analysis of the films, it is concluded that there exists in all of the films an eight-part thematic strategy, referred to herein as the contemporary princess narrative, which knits such seemingly disparate elements as a childs latchkey status, the ongoing feminist-inspired empowerment project, postmodern intertextuality, and systematic othering of foreign bodies into a powerfully cohesive and prescriptive trope that bears consideration equally for its anti-global messages as for its sudden and relatively uncontested ubiquity in the childrens media market."
2008-0153,Barriers Impeding Support: The Experiences of People With Bipolar Disorder,Traditional and Online Sources of Social Support,,,,Paper,Barriers Impeding Support: The Experiences of People With Bipolar Disorder,Traditional and Online Sources of Social Support,"Bipolar disorder is a mental illness with a significant negative impact on quality of life. People with bipolar disorder benefit when family and friends provide social support, but quantity and quality of support are often lacking. Prior research suggests the existence of multiple barriers that may prevent support-seeking or impede support provision. The current study provides a focused analysis of barriers to support-seeking and provision as identified in semi-structured interviews with people who have bipolar disorder (N = 29). These barriers include characteristics of bipolar disorder (e.g., its phasic nature), the stigma associated with mental illness, the desire for independence, lack of support-seeking skill, and fear of over-reaction by others. These and other barriers identified by interviewees are discussed with respect to their implications for improving the lives of people with bipolar disorder."

It sheds light on medias role as agents of social control and influence by examining such elements as labels attached to violence and how these elements speak to ideologies embedded in the news concerning the Palestinian struggle for state. News articles were chosen from top U.S. circulating newspapers that have foreign bureaus in Israel or the Occupied Territories. Findings highlight the role that nationalism plays in newsmaking, a role whose importance may extend beyond this particular conflict, as it could help us better understand the bearing of nationalism in other conflicts as well. The news simplified this complex conflict at the expense of providing sufficient, meaningful context to understand the nuances involved. For instance, framing the conflict in highly primordial terms ironically came with conflated understanding of identities."

Amongst the excitement and angst about globalization, the widening gap between rich and poor, there is a movement that is impacting global culturesthe dislocated global worker. With new communication technologies, workers can physically stay in their country and work in another country and live in several cultures simultaneously. Another aspect of this phenomenon is the worker who migrates to another country for employment opportunities and works in that country or any other country without physically relocating. In the midst of these transnational interactions issues of identity and culture are the foci of these new global realities. Aided by the use of new technologies, the new global workers have the opportunities to experience and influence their culture no matter where they are physically located.
This paper examines the questions: How is globalization dislocating our lived spacework and home? How is Internet technology used by migrant workers to rejuvenate culture?"
2008-0156,Beauty and the Flirt: Attractiveness and Approaches to Relationship Initiation,Accomodation and Attraction,,,,Paper,Beauty and the Flirt: Attractiveness and Approaches to Relationship Initiation,Accomodation and Attraction,"Two studies examined how women evaluated and responded to approach strategies commonly used by males. In Study 1, 522 participants identified 546 strategies, which were evaluated by coders. Affiliation and explicitness, but not dominance, predicted flirtatiousness. In Study 2, 361 females participated in a 2 x 4 experiment that explored the effects of physical attractiveness and four approach communication strategies on ratings of affiliation (Abrahams, 1994). Attractive men were more successful overall and a wider range of verbal strategies were rated as successful, compared to less attractive males. Fewer effective statements were available to less attractive males. The implications and limitations are discussed."

Roughly 10-20% of the assertions in these spots were supported by evidence (that is, identified a source for a claim). However, the longitudinal presidential data suggests that evidence in advertising was rare until the 1990s, when Bill Clinton in particular employed a great deal of evidence in his spots. Although the appeals in all groups ads were mainly positive (59-80% of statements in these ads were acclaims), evidence disproportionately supported attacks (54-80% of the utterances with evidence were attacks). There was a tendency to use evidence to support policy in presidential and senate spots, other spots were about as likely to use evidence to support claims about policy as character. Candidates in this sample used newspapers most frequently as sources of evidence, followed by governmental reports, statements from ones opponent, voting record, and other sources."

The virtual and the real world have become interwoven with each other through the opportunities of virtual trade. The distinction between work and play has become blurred (Yee 2006), as pleasures in online gaming can result in real world profit. Based on motivational approaches in economic theory (f.e. Herzberg 1959; Vroom 1964) and results from the uses & gratification research on video games, in particularly online role playing games (Yee 2002; Sherry et al. 2006), a sample of N = 442 Second Life users  recruited both in the game and out of the game  was questioned on their motivations to produce, to sell and to buy virtual goods and services within the virtual environment. The relationship between virtual trade and transaction to the real life was tested, as were influences from gender, occupation, and involvement with the game."

Two hypotheses (valence vs. action tendency) derived from the nature of emotions and properties of BIS/BAS were derived and tested against each other. The results from two-level tobit models showed that BIS and BAS showed a complex pattern of associations with emotions that was not wholly consistent with either the approach-avoidance or valence aspects of affect; and that surprise might be joint product of novelty and valence assessments. Implications and implications for future research were discussed."

What kinds of talk transpire between the participants before and after the broadcast interview? What functions do the before and after interview interaction seem to have? What social norms and conventions seem to influence the character of the pre-interview and post-interview discourse? How are their respective professional roles negotiated in these settings? The framing of the interview as an object of study in its production context aims to contribute to existing research on the news interview, specifically within Conversation Analysis (e.g. Clayman and Heritage 2002), which has not studied processes of production, but has mostly restricted itself to analyses of that which is broadcast to the audience."

It analyses how one source of media investment has developed a regional economy which in turn, fostered particular notions of political democracy. Many argue that Saudi media investments aim to control images about Saudi Arabia and the programs coming to its citizens; however, this conclusion ignores many of the structural issues involved in any hegemonic process as well as the social, economic and regional dimensions of these investments. This paper argues that Saudi - official and non-official, television investments are central to an emerging regional media economy. This symbiotic relationship is instrumental in the survival or creation of regional cities with specific strategic functions. This paper analyzed the nexus of alignment between Saudi media headquartered in Ryiadh and their investments spread over the three regional cities, Beirut, Cairo and Dubai."

In the original version, a disabled character was initially feared then eventually accepted. In an edited version, the fear was removed. The majority of children misunderstood the intended moral lesson, and failed to generalize beyond the specifics of the plot. Among those randomly assigned to the original version, comprehension of the events and emotions of the story was negatively associated with comprehension of the intended moral lesson. Among those assigned to the fear-removed version, comprehension of the events and emotions was positively associated with moral lesson comprehension. The positive effect of understanding the happy ending was weaker for those who saw the original version."

Taylor describes the double translation between conversation and text in organizations. Organizational structure in this view is accomplished structurationally, through a process of continual tacking between conversation and text, which may be important for two reasons. First, the dyad and small group remain the primary source of ideological affirmation in the PRC. Prospects for empirically testing the premises of the flatland perspective therefore seem promising. Second, the Chinese horizontal network of guanxi is not as responsive to the requirements of the text of a single organization/ industry as it is in North America. Instead, obligations in the Chinese organization are felt across families and organizations through the complex external networking. Characteristic of communication in a Chinese organization may be more similar to communication in the network form of organization than that of either the market or bureaucratic forms."

Results suggest, on the one hand, that men and women are targeted equally and that in new humor genres (e.g., lists and dictionaries) that are gaining Web popularity, men are scorned even more. On the other hand however, stereotypical representations of men and women still prevail. Moreover, whereas the essentialist theme of gender differences is central in many texts, humor about gender inequalities is marginal. The discussion contextualizes these findings to a backlash interpretation of postfeminism."
2008-0165,Between Racism and Rape: Discursive Gridlock in Newspaper Coverage of the Marcus Dixon Trial,Media Spectacles of Race,,,,Paper,Between Racism and Rape: Discursive Gridlock in Newspaper Coverage of the Marcus Dixon Trial,Media Spectacles of Race,"On May 15, 2003, Marcus Dixon, an 18-year-old African American from Rome, Georgia, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for allegedly raping a white 15-year-old girl. After 14 months in prison and a substantial amount of national media attention, the more serious felony charge was dropped and Dixon was released. I use newspaper coverage of the Dixon trial as a case study for my argument that the concept of discursive gridlock (Tucker, 1997) is a useful analytic tool for understanding how mass media can continue to talk about racism in fundamentally regressive ways. That is, by generating a gridlock between two binary positions, mass media are able to set the terms of debates about racial issues to exclude radical critiques and to avoid addressing more than one form of oppression or social inequality at once. Specifically, I analyze two ways that discursive gridlock operates in newspaper articles about the Dixon trial: (a) how the tensions between race and gender push issues of youth sexuality and agency to the margins and (b) how arguments pitting the trope of old South racism against the fantasy of a US post-civil rights colorblindness obscures structural racisms. To illustrate the extent of the rhetorical traffic jam, I argue that the discourses about the Dixon trial in three newspapers for different audiencesone local mainstream, one national mainstream, and one regional African Americaneach take up a limited range of binary positions on particular debates, thereby excluding all other issues."
2008-0166,Beyond the Virgin/Vamp Binary: Constructions of Female Sexuality by North Indian Women in the Context of Changing Representations of Women in Commercial Hindi Cinema,Gendered Gazing and International Representations,,,,Paper,Beyond the Virgin/Vamp Binary: Constructions of Female Sexuality by North Indian Women in the Context of Changing Representations of Women in Commercial Hindi Cinema,Gendered Gazing and International Representations,"Commercial Hindi (national language of India) cinema had been the solitary and a most potent form of mass media available in India till a short time ago. Thematically this media product has been criticized as limited, formulaic, kitschy, and ideologically has been labeled as regressive and supportive of the feudal, patriarchal societal discourse in society. The representations of women have been especially problematic in commercial Hindi cinema with the virgin/whore binary (Mira Nair, 2000), dominating. This clichéd, and much derided medium, though hugely popular is now seeing some changes in terms of thematic variety as well as representations of women as more complex, nuanced characters. This study analyses how north Indian women interpret the changes in the representations of women in commercial Hindi cinema, especially in terms of the portrayals of sexuality of women, and constructions of their own sexuality and femininity in the context of these movies. It underlines the internalized patriarchal ideology of feminine sexuality and morality within which the popular media texts of commercial Hindi films are consumed by elite north Indian women. The gendered othering (Parameswaran, 2002) of the Western or Westernized Indian woman continues the mapping of a binary morality of purity and promiscuity on Indian and Western women respectively. A primarily dominant/preferred reading of the movies is evidence of a blissful ignorance of the circumscribed nature of notions of womens sexuality and positionality in the family and in society."

Drawing on Nardi (2005), this study similarly argues that sharing videos can demonstrate affective willingness to maintain and negotiate social relationships. In some cases, the content of a video is less important than is circulating the video itself. This paper will also incorporate Rouses (1991) ideas about media circuits to argue that social practicessuch as friendingon social network sites are less salient to many YouTube participants than is circulating videos with particular meanings. Although viewed in public, the content of certain videos is actually targeted to and interpreted in relatively private ways by specific groups of friends. Although Rouse theorized possible telephony-based media circuits, the present study materially traces specific media circuits by analyzing posted videos, related discourse, and comments from ethnographic interviews.

Integrating Competing Concepts to Explain News Processing,,,,Paper,"Beyond Vividness: The Impact of Narratives versus Personalization on Message Selection, Liking, and Recall",News Between Narrativity and News Value. Integrating Competing Concepts to Explain News Processing,"News value research and exemplification theory share the assumption that personalized news presentations facilitate news selection, issue perception, and recall. Exemplification is effective by providing the audience with vivid and concrete personal case descriptions (exemplars) rather than facts and statistics. However, a theoretical ambiguity remains: It may not be the exemplar, but the story that is effective in news reception. Broad definitions of exemplification that comprise mere examples as well as elaborate stories encourage this ambiguity.

Evidence from narrative persuasion (e.g., Green & Brock, 2000), physiological phenomena in information processing (episodic buffer/memory in humans: Harris, Cady & Tran, 2006), and dual-process theories (Chaiken & Trope, 1999) suggests that message selection, liking, and recall are better for stories compared to mere exemplars or factual presentations in news.

This paper thus expands the view on news personalization by theoretically and empirically distinguishing between (a) no presentation of exemplars, (b) presentation of exemplars, and (c) telling the story of exemplars. We hypothesize that selection, liking and recall is highest when a text is written as a story, moderate when it features exemplars, and low as factual text. In an experiment with 126 respondents, three news topics were manipulated to correspond to these three presentation types. Respondents first stated their reading preferences for these articles. After reading them, respondents indicated their liking and completed a free and a cued recall test of article facts. The findings will be discussed in terms of theoretical advancement of exemplification theory and relevance for journalistic news presentations."

This paper looks at how biracial/multiracial characters in film are represented and the language or lack of language used in the representation. In this paper, I examine the language in the films Imitation of Life and Get on the Bus, particularly regarding the biracial characters and how this racially mixed representation is either silenced or given a voice. The importance of this topic lies in the influential aspect of media. There are very few biracial characters in the media. Their race plays into the message that they are sending, and I am curious in seeing who has the power to name their identity."

Based on a novel by Thomas Harris, the premise of the novel and film encompasses a plan by a radical Arab faction, Black September, and Vietnam P.O.W., Michael Lander, to attack America in retribution for its support of Israel by hauling over a crowded Super Bowl a blimp loaded with 200,000 rifle darts in its nacelle.
This essay explores the interrelationship of the U.S. domestic and foreign policy apparatuses, the U.S. film industry, and ideological changes in media culture in the mid-1970s, which led to new obsessions of storytelling in the form of Arab counterterrorism thrillers, and laid the groundwork for subsequent films of the 1980s and 1990s. Through reconstructing Black Sundays production history, divergence from the standard disaster films, and position within the counterterrorism discourses of the 1970s, I hope to initiate a new discussion that recognizes the complex process of the assimilation and encoding of Middle Eastern political and religious violence into a Hollywood (and consequently, American) ideological vision. Employing various theoretical positions and methodologies, such as archival research, political economy and critical production history, this study seeks to account for a broader social process and impact of Hollywood counterterrorist texts and to reveal a set of norms and attitudes of filmmakers and the cultural totality within which they produced such films."

Focusing specifically on the liberal bloggers Glenn Greenwald and Atrios (Duncan Black), it treats their media criticism as an example of informal public sphere communication intended to challenge journalists authority to filter opinions and establish a legitimate view of the political world. For several years now, liberal bloggers have been systematically exposing and debunking the honorific rhetoric that journalists often use either to sidestep criticism from non-journalists or to dismiss political figures and points of view that their club deems unworthy of serious consideration. But bloggers challenge this rhetoric in ways that are both characteristic of rational print discourse and unique to allusive and high-context Internet discourse. By issuing such challenges, liberal bloggers attempt to disrupt processes of communicative trust that they see as failing to serve the public good."

An international sample of personal blog writers (n = 416) completed an online survey conducted over a three week period. Results show that bloggers who have not made any online friendships tend to be younger, have higher need for affiliation, and have been blogging for a shorter period of time. Regression analyses reveal that need for affiliation leads to more self-disclosure, and amount of online friendships is predicted by amount of perceived reciprocity. Results also indicate that more intimacy and honesty in self-disclosure lead to more perceived reciprocity, while more intimacy and honesty in perceived reciprocity lead to higher degrees of intimacy and trust in online friendships. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed."

This study explores that question through an analysis of political content in one citys blogs and media outlets within the framework of agenda setting theory, specifically intermedia agenda setting. The resulting picture is of bloggers who rely heavily on mainstream media for updates and information, which flies in the face of popular notions of blogs as making traditional media irrelevant. Through an analysis of sourcing and story triggers, this study finds that, at least on the local level, politically-oriented blogs are dependent for a high percentage of their content on newspapers and television stations. What blogs then add to the coverage is commentary about issues already in the news. Paradoxically, the study also found that blogs used primary documents as their main source of information much more frequently than newspaper or television did."

In the present study, 208 kindergarten through twelfth grade teachers read one of six teacher misconduct scenarios that varied according to severity and peer relationship type and indicated their likelihood to report the teacher to the principal, school board, a media outlet, and to talk to the teacher directly. Results indicate that teachers were most likely to talk to the offending teacher directly, followed by reporting the misconduct to the principal, school board, and then the media. Teachers were also more likely to report severe misconduct and to talk directly with special versus other types of peers. Finally, misconduct severity interacted with teacher age, school size, and student grade level, and peer type interacted with school size to affect whistle blowing."

Other media used professional pictures of the body under a white sheet, which, although better in quality, lacked the emotional appeal. This example offers an illuminating glimpse of the changes engulfing media whereby the guarantee of trustworthiness has shifted from authoritative sources to authentic experiences, as expressed in amateurs blurry pictures and unrestrained emotions. We examine this challenge to journalism through cases where Dutch media decided to distribute outlaw images, drawing on interviews conducted with journalists and picture editors. The framework of our discussion is the ´emotionalisation of the public domain; because images from alternative sources usually carry a strong emotional quality, it is important to consider the social and political consequences of their distribution."
2008-0176,Bollywood Cinema at the Crossroads: Tracking the Dialectics of Globalization in Postcolonial Indian Cinema,Global Flows and Networks,,,,Paper,Bollywood Cinema at the Crossroads: Tracking the Dialectics of Globalization in Postcolonial Indian Cinema,Global Flows and Networks,"Given the changing social-political-economic context of Indian cinema, this paper investigates the prevalence of five globalization themes in the most popular Hindi films of the post-colonial era and how these thematic patterns inform our understanding of the efforts made by producers to position India domestically and globally as a viable economic, political, and cultural force. Adopting a quantitative content analysis case study approach, the researchers drew upon a sample of the most popular Hindi films in the past sixty years to select six highly popular films representing the six decades (1947-2007) since Independence. The six films were analyzed using Schaefers (2006) five dialectical themes that appeared to signal forces of globalization within contemporary Indian cinema. These included (a) East <--> West, (b) Local <--> Global, (c) Motherland <-->Diaspora, (d) Traditional <--> Modern, and (e) Popular <--> Artistic. The data provided an interesting, and in some cases counter-intuitive, glimpse into the concretized manifestation of these dialectics within actual Hindi films. Two of the dialectics occurred in at least half of the 203 coded chapters. More than seventy percent of all chapters for five of the films depicted both Eastern and Western content and two-thirds of the films featured more Artistic than Popular content. A major shift was the gradual erosion of Traditional content across the six decades. A systematic study of this nature analyses the trends across the decades and refutes some of the previous scholarship that has looked at shifts in the dialectical themes of Indian cinema."

Using Barthes' semiotic analysis of myth, we will address the various signifiers that reflect the motivations for crossing into the United States, or the signified U.S. American Dream; the signifiers of identification work to distinguish between the signified safe and unsafe border crosser. We will highlight the bridge as the central sign that emphasizes the difference between the two entities living on either side of it; its mythological significance includes a lasting symbol of the power of the dominant, U.S. American culture."

A representative nationwide CATI survey and a series of focus groups were conducted to examine the relationship between online social capital and political participation. Survey findings suggest a positive association between the two variables, with online bridging capital likely to predict online political participation, and online bonding capital likely to predict traditional political participation. Furthermore, focus groups indicate that bridging-wise, the Internet promotes information flow; connection with a broader range of people; sense of being a part of a group; and reciprocity within a community. Bonding-wise, politically active groups recognized the ability to facilitate and organize online, but indicated a preference to participate effectively in the traditional sphere. In general, however, focus groups suggest a certain level of distrust in online relationships. Still, the confidence expressed in traditional bonding relationships that are overlapping with those online, indicates the potential of online bonding capital to grow."

This paper will probe the contours and limits of this argument, with reference to the phenomenon of reality television, specifically MTVs docusoap The Hills. Reality television narratives and processes of production have much in common with the contemporary work environment; all foreground the need for the performance of a flexible, entrepreneurial self and encourage the alignment of that self with corporate values. The Hills is the apotheosis of these processes, as it tells the story of white, privileged twenty-somethings who live their lives perpetually in front of MTV cameras. Simultaneously people and actors, working and living, the cyber-subjects of The Hills are rendered constantly productive, serving as extended promotions for the MTV network and their own celebrity brand. But, as the instrumental presence of the MTV camera comes to penetrate and discipline the affective flow of its subjects lives over time, blurring distinctions between life, work, and self-advantaging exchange, arguments about the potentially productive communal excess, and final immeasurability of, affective and immaterial labour are seriously undermined."

Impulse buying intent originates from an emotionally fuelled urge to buy (i.e., affective component) and a lack of planning (i.e., cognitive component). It is argued that online consumers have lower impulse buying intentions, because the sensory-limited online shopping environment is less able to engender affective responses and to energize the urge to buy and because the information-rich nature of the Internet may stimulate planned purchasing. These assumptions are tested and confirmed by demonstrating the effects of shopping environment on affective responses and on the cognitive and affective component of impulse buying intent in two scenario-based experiments. To sustain these findings it is additionally demonstrated that online purchase decisions are based more on cognition than on affect."

The remaining questions: What holds (political) communities together? How could all parts of society be integrated? To cover complexity, and to check possibilities for intervention, one has to clarify if and how mass media can contribute to social cohesion. Europe and particularly Germany as a (still young) nation of immigration, shows several of the typical consequences following globalization and differentiation. Another reason for choosing Germany as a model for checking the role of mass media facing social cohesion: The Ally after World War II formed (in western Germany) a unique broadcasting system. The radio station Funkhaus Europa is todays answer of the WDR to an increasing demand in Europe for integration of people of foreign descent. Predominantly considered as a praiseworthy model and embedded in a broadcasting structure that allows a comparison to a mainstream program of the same parent company without distortions caused by differing basic parameters, it is particularly suitable as a case study. The core questions: Which characteristics define the coverage and the structure of the station? In addition these characteristics are weighted whether they are deliberately employed as a means of integration. At last one has to face the ideas and objectives the daily programs of Funkhaus Europa are based on. Including integration theories of various academic research fields and media research finally the question of the integrative role of mass media is discussed."

Community is at the heart of the transect. This path is disrupted as we move from relationships of place to those of connection. Neighbors are replaced with the chosen strangers of a-location. The rise of the edge city, privatization of urbanity, suburban sprawl are all in part a consequence of technological developments. This paper examines the concept of the transect from a media perspective and explore how the accoutrements of connection are antiquating older concepts of zoning and planning."

This rejection was by no means a sudden sign of mistrust in the institutions of European politics, but rather the tipping and flash point of a long-standing democratic deficit and, more broadly, lack of cultural legitimacy experienced by European politics in relation to European citizens. In the light of these events, new EU communication policy emphasizes the importance of direct communication with European citizens through simple, repetitive language and visual symbols. With fieldwork and interviews conducted in Brussels (at the European Commission and the European Parliament), I examine some of the European Commission's first attempts to adopt corporate communication techniques in order to visually brand and therefore also communicate the European project more 'directly'. In doing this, I problematize current trends in EU public communication, while also highlighting the tensions and contradictions that are at work in this process of institutional change."

Beyond the requirement to take the form of a campaign ad against George W. Bush, their tone (satirical, sincere), topics (environment, Iraq War, economy), and form (animation, staged narrative, documentary) reflect diverse styles of political communication. However, the majority invoke discourses about truth and lies, whether to interrogate Bushs morality, ethics, and facts, or citizens right to truth. Drawing on Stuart Hall, Nick Couldry, and Michel Foucault we examine disjunctures between the deployment of symbols and images, and questions about possible reception and interpretation. We triangulate this with interview data in which Bushin30 producers discuss their own rhetorical choices (part of the Rethinking Media and Democracy Project), highlighting how they question their use of propaganda style and choice of patriotic images. In sum, this paper raises questions about the ethical complexity of representations and circulation of signs within tactical media interventions.

This perception of homogeneity critically affects individuals identities and impacts our understanding and interpretation of intercultural experiences. Teaching intercultural communication in this context poses several challenges to instructors. Even when boundaries seem blurred, and we are experiencing McLuhans Global village effect, important histories (political, social, economical, hidden, etc.) influence our cultural identities and intercultural encounters. In order to understand some currents events (9/11; Irak war, etc.) and their impact on our identities and intercultural experiences, we need to situate these events in historical and political contexts that help give meaning to our behaviors and attitudes. This presentation is aimed at exploring some of the many challenges instructors find when teaching intercultural communication in the U.S. and tries to examine ways to foster students self reflection through experiential learning and critical dialogue techniques to help them understand how histories and contexts shape and influence each of their daily intercultural encounters."

Participants responded to a survey designed to assess appraisals, attributions, and consequences of hurtful communication, and cultural orientation through a self-construal measure. The findings indicated that higher degrees of interdependence were associated with greater overall feelings of hurt from a hurtful episode. In response to the hurtful message, those high in independence projected positive emotions, while people high in interdependence felt more negative affect. As a result, higher independence was related to greater potential for using assertive responses to the perpetrator of the message. Finally, those high in interdependence perceived more substantial relational strain on the overall relationship. The results, taken as a whole, provide support for the claim that the way in which people experience hurtful messages is influenced in part by their culture. As such, culture must be taken into consideration in future theorizing on hurt in interpersonal relationships."

Henry Jenkins (2006), for example, applies Pierre Levys theory of collective intelligence to argue that fan practices can be read as an alternative source of media power (p. 4), while Liesbit van Zoonen (2005) observes parallels between fans and the ideal citizens of a deliberative democracy. My own research into the intense fan activity that has accumulated around Comedy Centrals news parody The Colbert Report suggests that fan practices are considerably more socially and politically ambiguous, and often contradictory in their positioning vis-à-vis corporate media powers. As part of the larger Rethinking Media and Democracy research project, this paper draws on interviews with Colbert Report fans, insights into the contemporary uses of satire, and analysis of audience activities, including the production of fan videos, the circulation of clips, and the creation of blogs and archives. It aims to raise questions not only about the politics of fandom but about our very understanding of what counts as political activity within complex digital media environments.

My goal is to explore the issue of political persuasion in a real environment of players, building upon the already well-established left-wing critique of war-themed video game content and giving a chance for fans to speak for themselves about shooter video games, war, politics, and the institution of the military. While any conclusions drawn from this kind of qualitative, exploratory approach must be tentative at best, the textual richness of participant responses resulting from such a study can offer a great deal of insight into how the games are subjectively experienced and interpreted within a larger ideological and political context. Results suggest that the games are quite powerful in the sense that they are able to make a credible case for the rectitude of Western military operations using a persuasive language of historical authenticity. On the other hand, this power is inherently soft; it exists on the level of popular culture and is therefore negotiable, open to ideological interpretation and even resistance. The study paints a picture of the audience for Call of Duty and Medal of Honor as surprisingly diverse, with a number of participants displaying reading strategies which run counter to the hegemonic strong defense interpretation of World War II exhibited by others."

This textual analysis of a series of five Campaign for Real Beauty billboards, commonly referred to as the Dove Vote Ads, seeks to determine whether the message of the Dove Vote Ads is consistent with the Campaign for Real Beautys mission of societal change and widening the societal definition of beauty. This analysis identifies the conflicting messages inherit in the Dove Vote Ads. Findings indicate a contradiction between the stated goal of the Campaign for Real Beauty and the ads invitation to judge women. Doves stated mission of cultural change is not supported by the content of the advertisements in the series."

We wondered how people make use of such content in making specific health decisions. We studied both the information they actively seek (seeking) and that which they encounter in a less purposive way (scanning) through a nationally representative survey of adults aged 40-70 years (n=2,489) focused on information use around three prevention behaviors (dieting, fruit and vegetable consumption and exercising) and three screening test behaviors (prostate-specific antigen, colonoscopy, mammogram). Overall, respondents reported a great deal of scanning and somewhat less seeking (on average 62% versus 28% for each behavior), and used a range of sources including mass media, interpersonal conversations and the Internet, alongside physicians. Seeking was predicted by female gender; age of 55-64 vs. 40-44; higher education; Black race and Hispanic ethnicity and being married. Scanning was predicted by older age, female gender and education. Respondents were fairly consistent in their place on a typology of scanning and seeking across behaviors. Seeking was associated with all three prevention and all three screening behaviors and three of six behaviors for scanning."

Study sample included 294 recently diagnosed breast cancer patients. Data included pretest survey scores of demographic, disease-related, and psychosocial factors and automatically collected IHCS use data over the 4-month intervention. Statistical analyses correlated pre-test survey scores with subsequent, specific types of IHCS service usage. Patterns of online cancer information seeking differed according to the patients characteristics, suggesting that patients seek IHCS information and services that might help them most. Results of this study can inform more effective resource development for future eHealth applications."

An online survey of 461 candidates who campaigned for public office in the United States during the 2006 election cycle was carried out. Results showed that most candidates enjoyed the campaign experience even though they found it extremely demanding and emotionally draining. The majority indicated that their interactions with the press were positive, some extremely so. Even so, candidates named some negative features of their campaign experience, such as attacks from their opponents and poor media coverage, including bias and emphasis on negative campaigning. The great majority of candidates indicated that they would run again. Though electoral success increased willingness to reenter the electoral arena, even those who lost said they would try again."

The present study seeks to better understand the impact of this latter institution through an analysis of marketers role in the construction of Halloween in Postwar and modern America. I locate this analysis in a social constructionist framework which espouses that collective memories of the past are shaped by present social and institutional interests. This proves to be a particularly useful framework for conceptualizing the interplay between advertising, ritual, and society. Research underpinning this study comes from a selective sample of articles and advertisements in the advertising trade press from 1956 through 2006 as well as from data from public opinion polls and socio-histories of the holidays. The findings of this study suggest that marketers shape holiday rituals based on the needs of their companies, their industries, and their consumers. Not only do these results add a rich layer of discourse to existing literature on holiday commercialism, but they can also help us to better understand how advertisers seek to maintain control over our sense of time."

On the basis of past research findings on interactivity and perceptions, we predicted that Websites with higher interactivity will elicit more positive perceptions of the organization. We explored the underlying theoretical mechanisms for this relationship by investigating four mediating variables--customization, involvement, novelty and liking--and one moderating variable--job seeking status. Interactivity was operationalized for this experiment using existing recruitment Websites from the oil and energy industry so as to maximize ecological validity for PR practitioners. Participants (N = 116) in a between-subjects experiment were exposed to either a low, medium or high-interactivity Website and then filled out a questionnaire. Results indicate that the level of Website interactivity positively influenced participants' perceptions of the organization. The assessment of intervening variables determined that liking and involvement fully mediated this relationship. These findings demonstrate the theoretical complexity of interactivityit can at once attract users peripherally with likeable aesthetics and engage them centrally by including features that involve them. Theoretical as well as practical implications for PR practitioners are discussed."

An Experimental Investigation of Emotion Generated by Dance Dance Revolution,Game Studies Top Papers,"What role does media-generated emotion play in youth creativity? Is it an assessment tool? Does it alter the kind of attention given to a problem? Does it foster or impede the flow of ideas? Is it energizing physically or mentally? By varying the levels of arousal associated with low, medium and high levels of exertion in Dance Dance Revolution, and inducing a positive or negative mood, this study offers evidence that media-generated emotion significantly affects creativity through the interaction of arousal and valence. Faced with the cognitive demand of creativity, lower arousal levels resulted in higher creativity scores when coupled with a negative mood. At high arousal levels, a positive mood resulted in greater creativity. The results of the study are evaluated in light of theories of emotion as a prime, as information, as a moderator of attention, and in relation to cognitive capacity."

Within a new environment, Catholic parishes often serve as spaces of segmented assimilation where new immigrants can maintain their native values while transitioning into to mainstream culture. Within an ethnically mixed neighborhood such as Crenshaw, the universality of the Catholic Church also provides it with a unique opportunity to integrate Latinos with Catholic residents of other ethnic backgrounds and cultural traditions. Using a multi-methodological approach that includes focus groups, participant observation, and in-depth interviews with parish pastors, this study examines the role that Catholic parishes play as agents of integration and isolation."

immigrants and immigrant advocates. Intense policy discussions and vivid moral panics
about race, economics, and terrorism contextualize the marches in news media
discourses. This paper understands the marches through the lens of the public screen,
arguing that the highly visual displays of civic activism and the framing power of news
organizations illustrate its opportunities and limitations. Focusing on news coverage of
the McArthur Park episode in 2007, where news reporters were caught in a massive and
violent Los Angeles Police sweep along with the protesters, this paper also argues that
the ensuing reporting both challenged and confirmed DeLuca and Peeples
conceptualization of the public screen. Informed by critical Latina/o media studies, this
paper concludes that public conflict unfolding within predetermined frames of race and
ethnicity bring special considerations for theories of power and resistance in news
coverage."

A product of Hollywood and its correlative celebrity culture, Jolies image is fueled and shaped by elaborate publicity and public relations mechanisms that carefully intertwine her public and private lives, juxtaposing her humanitarian efforts with her role as mother. In turn, Jolie gets situated as maternal crusader, on a rescue mission that has real-world socio-political implications. Jolie both personally donates time and money, and significantly brings attention, spectacle, even glamour to the refugee cause as it gets covered a wide array of popular media and entertainment outlets. The association with giving, therefore, not only can change Jolies image and commodity status; Jolie also potentially changes the media and public perception of the cause."

However, there are published instances where investigators misinterpreted the coefficients corresponding to variables that are used to form interaction terms. We briefly outline the interpretation of such coefficients and show through an example from a recently published study how arbitrary choices about the scaling or coding of variables prior to analysis can produce coefficients and hypothesis tests for so-called main effects that have different and sometimes little substantive meaning. A more widespread understanding of these principles will reduce the number unjustified claims that are made in the communication literature"

That is, following Thomas Osborne?s view of the archive ?as a means of generating credibility,? (Osborne, 1999: 51) how artists, their hit songs and their celebrity come to incorporate particular public memories in ways which render the singular statements about the past, history and change that they articulate authoritative and legitimate. My paper aims at putting this proposition to work by exploring through its conceptual lenses the memorialization (mise en mé­¯ire) of pop superstar Cé¬©ne Dion in Qué¢¥c which, in my view, it further problematizes. I set this exploration in motion by examining how the celebrations that marked the 25th anniversary of the singer?s career in June 2006, hinged on the principles of publicity, singularity, and mundanity characteristic of archival credibility. Moving onto a terrain opened up theoretically by John Frow (1997) I then consider how these principles and the credibility that they engender are actualized through particular practices of recall and technologies of memorialization ? the chronicle and the testimonial being the most salient. These practices and technologies, I argue, shape the incorporation of ?Cé¬©ne? and her fame into/as public memories that their archiving renders possible ? an incorporation which, as I suggest by way of conclusion, resembles a radical ?biographization.?"

It is both necessary and meaningful to review the state of intercultural communication education, training, and research outside the U.S. context. With this purpose in mind, this paper will present an overview of intercultural communication education in Japan, which was traditionally highly homogeneous in terms of culture and ethnicity but is now undergoing a rapid transformation into a multicultural society representing diverse values, beliefs and attitudes of numerous co-cultures as well.

This paper focuses on identifying specific challenges and promises for instructors and students in intercultural communication courses in Japanese colleges and universities. A number of specific issues will be addressed, including: (1) there are not enough teaching resources and techniques which can be used effectively with non-U.S. student groups; (2) initially students are not sufficiently motivated to study intercultural communication due to their limited exposure to not only foreign cultures but also various co-cultures within Japanese culture; and (3) while emphasizing cognitive components and adopting the culture-general approach as a primary mode of instruction, important affective and behavioral intercultural competence and skills should also be fully covered in class. Some concrete suggestions for alleviating these difficulties are also presented based on the authors experience."

The paper also discusses some of the most important challenges which are confronting modern Egyptian media and negatively affecting their performance and professionalism. These include widespread illiteracy, the lack of sufficient political freedom and independence, the barriers to gaining the required knowledge and information, and the lack of sufficient technical resources and training.
These aspects will be explored in a comparative context which compares the similarities and differences between the case of modern Egyptian media and other media systems and models, whether in the Third World, or in highly developed Western countries."

The experience of transportation  being absorbed in a narrative (Green & Brock, 2000)  and its relationship to persuasion were considered in two studies exploring responses to health promoting mass media messages. Following Epsteins (1994) Cognitive-Experiential Self Theory, two pathways to persuasion were considered: cognitive and experiential. In study 1 (N=121), smokers who experienced increased transportation in response to anti-smoking messages reported that they would make a greater effort to quit smoking, and this effect was mediated by both experiential (emotional and self-referencing) and cognitive responses to the message. In study 2 (N=110), experiential responses to magazine messages promoting skin protection were related to intentions to protect oneself, and this effect was mediated by feelings of risk. The implications of these results are discussed at both the applied and theoretical level."

Newsweek and Time articles were analyzed to determine the amount of issue versus image coverage that each candidate received. Findings indicate that there is less issue coverage in 2007 than in 1984, while certain types of image portrayal have surfaced. It can be argued that the quality of campaign coverage has declined over time."

Some were designed to be shown among movie trailers in theaters, others are made available online; some are delivered to schools as curricular materials to be incorporated into K-12 classrooms. Through an examination of the materials themselves and through interviews with their designers, this presentation examines not only their characterization of copyright law, but their implicit claims about how, why, an by whom culture is produced, circulated, and consumed. These campaigns traffic in and perpetuate an industry-centric idea of what copyright is for, how technology is meant to be used, and why culture is important, helping to structure the dynamics of cultural participation. Amid these assumptions, comfortable roles are offered to young users of new media -- particular that of consumer rather than user or citizen -- roles that are far from neutral in the current debates about cultural policy, and work against the tide of emerging forms of creativity and collaboration."

This limits our ability to evaluate claims regarding the extent to which social networking sites function as venues for social relationships and community. Personal profiles on MySpace were examined in order to provide a descriptive frame for evaluating the worlds largest social networking site. Profiles (N = 2000) were randomly selected and coded for communicative affordances associated with membership characteristics and functions, personal expression, and social connection. Results suggested that MySpace was a far less social place that is frequently presumed. Approximately 20% of the profiles had been abandoned or deleted, while another 5% represented entertainers, celebrities, political figures, or commercial interests. Over half of the owners of the remaining profiles had not logged in within the previous 2.5 months and almost 20% had not logged in for over a year. Most (72%) allowed public views of their profiles, but only 22% customized their profiles and less than half (41%) displayed a personal picture. MySpaces counts of friends were found to be inflated. When corrected, approximately 55% of those with public profiles listed no friends and another 10% listed only one or two. Nearly 62% had received no comments from friends. The overall pattern of low social involvement was observed across all demographic groups. These results challenge the common metaphor of social networking sites as communities."

It has been suggested, however, that children younger than eight often possess knowledge of persuasive intent but that the verbal measures typically used to assess the construct prevent children from retrieving and expressing their stored knowledge. Using a new verbal measure of knowledge of persuasive intent that provides cues to help children access stored information, the present study examined the relationship between knowledge of persuasive intent and age and assessed whether children younger than eight years old understand persuasive intent. A sample of 133 children between the ages of five and eleven years old completed the knowledge of persuasive intent measure, which demonstrated both high intercoder and test-retest reliability. In contrast to previous research, the results indicated that a majority of five-, six-, and seven-year-olds evidenced knowledge of persuasive intent when questioned in a manner that supported their more limited expressive abilities. (Virtually all of the older children possessed knowledge of persuasive intent, as well.) At the same time, a substantial increase in the proportion of children expressing knowledge of persuasive intent was observed between seven and eight years of age. The results of this study suggest that while knowledge of persuasive intent is correlated with age, the type of measure used to assess the construct can strongly affect the responses children provide."

Chinese efforts at asserting greater control of the rapidly evolving networked communication infrastructure have been multifaceted. Apart from persistent efforts in pushing for the internationalization of Internet governance, the past few years have witnessed an escalation of domestic discourses on network sovereignty and indigenous innovations or the mastery of core technologies, at both the basic developmental as well as industrial and technological policy discourse levels. An elite consensus has crystallized around the full-scale mobilization of national resources for catching up with the US in the hardware and software of IT developments, and in particular, for achieving potential leadership in next generation network technologies. However, Chinas pursuits of national development and technological leadership in the network age continue to be constrained by a whole range of domestic political economic forces on the one hand, and mediated by the paradoxical dynamics of inter-state cooperation and rivalry in the political economy of global communication on the other. The growing transnational nature of the capitalist accumulation process, of which Chinas deepened global integration through its increasingly market-driven and rapidly expanding information industry has been a critical component, has further complicated the Chinese states pursuit of indigenous economic and technological developments."

As one of the few developing countries to host the Olympics, China sees this mega event a golden opportunity to place itself on a global stage. Among the official promotional films, China Forever stands out for its visual appeals and charming imageries. Drawing literatures in semiotics, discourse analysis, sports history and theories of Orientalism, I will examine the visual composition, juxtaposition, selection and content of imageries in this film in relation to Chinas national identity, foreign relation, ethnic minorities and foreign policies. I argue that this film is a self-representation of the country under multiple gazes from the West, while it also reflects an internal Orientalist gaze from the Han Chinese to ethnic minorities."

Based on the recognition that the national media in China have helped propagated the state's positive view of globalization and that the condition of canalization should be applicable in the case under study, we hypothesize a positive relationship between national media consumption and attitudes towards globalization, as well as an interaction effect between national media consumption and nationalistic sentiments on attitudes towards globalization. Our survey analysis shows support for the hypotheses. Implications of the results are discussed."

Do they also act as nonverbal cues in computer mediated communication? 55 participants were asked to rate a job candidate described in a vignette. Candidates varied in their valence (high valence, low valence) and in their response latency to an e-mail (normative one day latency, and nonnormative latencies of two weeks, and of total silence for a month). Candidates were identical in all other respects. The results show that the normative online response latency was more expected and resulted in more positive evaluations of the candidate. Complex interactions between response latency and candidate valence were observed. The importance of response latency as a nonverbal cue in computer mediated communication is discussed."
2008-0213,Citizen Journalism: Access to Writers Versus Access to Sources?,News Work Routines,,,,Paper,Citizen Journalism: Access to Writers Versus Access to Sources?,News Work Routines,"The present study marks the first time that the day-to-day practices of citizen reporters are examined in an in-depth manner, to include the ways in which they avail themselves of sources and produce original news items. Moreover, the paper compares the methods and means of citizen reporters with those of their counterparts from the mainstream press. Data was gleaned from a series of reconstruction interviews in which reporters from Israeli citizen and mainstream news websites explained how they formulated their sampled items. The paper suggests a round-about version of the news access theory, whereby citizen journalists are hindered by their inferior access to news sources, unlike mainstream journalism, where the problem is the superior access of some of their sources to extensive and favored coverage. There are several symptoms for citizen reporters limited news access: their modest use of human sources; the high proportion of one-source items; their reluctance to interactively negotiate versions with sources; and the absence of established relations with most of their sources. Therefore, citizen reporters associations with sources tend to be ad hoc exchanges, rather than long-term role relationships. On the other hand, citizen reporters have adopted several mechanisms that help them make up for their comparably limited access. For example, they are much more likely to pursue stories at their own initiative. In addition, they tend to predicate their stories on firsthand witnessing, technical sources (mainly internet), personal acquaintances, and on their own experience."

First, the focus on the actual performance of citizen journalists can help narrow disturbing gaps between the theoretical discourse about their potential contribution to democratic life and the reality on the ground. Second, it suggests that one of the best loci to study citizen journalism are citizen websites, where ordinary people show their capacities and incapacities as producers of news, free of the hurdles and constraints exerted by mainstream journalists who may feel threatened. Third, the method, which allows citizen reporters to reconstruct how they obtained each sampled news item, minimizes biases created by free-floating description or sporadic observation. Finally, the comparative perspective, in which mainstream journalists are studied concomitantly using the same methodology, supplies a point of reference to benchmark citizen journalists activity. Findings show that citizens patterns of sourcing news, and some of their output, indicate they can do better than the naysayers assert, producing news with considerable public value. However, they cannot perform as well as the well wishers expect, having severe difficulties in accessing human sources.

The main problem of the suggested framework is that comparing news practices of citizens with those of mainstream journalists gives an unavoidable advantage to the latter. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a specific sociology of citizen journalism, in order to study this promising type of journalism through its own criteria."

Through a survey and a set of semi-structured interviews, a set of community-based structural components were identified and tested for strength and significant relationships using statistical testing methods. Findings suggest that this citizen-based networked community fits into a networked model called a Community of Practice, with vigilance emerging as a sustainable and highly desirable post-9/11 behavior. Also, various Coast Guard-initiated communications were tested for impact on the network; volunteers who received direct phone calls for assistance correlated to significantly higher levels of agency trust, while those receiving written communications maintained a heightened sense of access. These findings underscore the potential of government agencies charged to effectively educate invested constituents, build trust and create grass-roots partnerships  ultimately putting the home back in homeland security."

This article aims to examine the impact of new media on the encoding of persuasive messages in sales emails as a channel of direct marketing, and the extent to which the use of new media influences the overall interactional or social strategy of credibility enhancement and persuasion in the context of sales promotion. A genre analysis based on a modified move scheme proposed in this study was conducted on 160 sales letters (80 emails and 80 prints) randomly selected from a database of 10,972 sales letters collected from 36 categories of recipients in Hong Kong over a six-month period. Similarities and differences in discourse structures were found across the two corpora, and discussions were made with reference to a conceptual model titled the Lingual-Belief Interaction Model proposed by the author. The model addresses the role of text, context, and interface in sales email study on the one hand, and the interplay of belief, interaction, and language in persuasive communication on the other. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 specialist and corporate informants in the field of sales promotion communication to verify the results of analysis."

As the reality of climate change is finally acknowledged beyond the scientific and environmental community, what kinds of actions to address climate change are currently promoted? This paper will examine climate change activism by looking at the ways in which action to mitigate climate change is being enacted across a range of environmental groups, from international NGOs such as Greenpeace and WWF, to grassroots direct actions like the Camp for Climate Change (UK). It will ask, how are individual and governmental actions framed by such groups, what discourses are used in the call for action, and what practices are advocated? In doing so, the paper seeks to shed light on the current status of climate activism."

Results show that multilevel analysis allows us to detect the effect of predictors that correlational analysis did not and provide the overall picture of pattern among families. Overall, the results suggest that conformity orientation explains understanding for both individual level and family level while the effect of communication orientation on understanding is explained better at a family-level. The present study showed that results of ACQ understanding between parent and child showed systematic differences with conformity and communication orientation and these relationships would not be found if multilevel modeling has not built."

Many bloggers immediately criticized the proposed code, charging that it contradicted the principles of free speech that make blogs ideal forums for open and intense discussions. Supporters of enforcing standards of behavior, however, argued rules are necessary in order for blogs to serve an equally important functionthat of providing a virtual public sphere, or a civil society. This paper takes a theoretically grounded approach to examining precedents that both support and undermine calls for regulating blog content. Historically, the U.S. government has taken a hands-off approach to policing media content. In addition, Web users have taken advantage of the Internets open architecture to establish their own system of regulating one another. This paper proposes that site moderators establish clear guidelines for the rules of engagement on their individual blogs. This may mean barring profanity and physical threatsand deleting such comments when they appear. Bloggers who choose to author such comments, regardless of the policy, will have scant room to complain about the consequences. Another tenet of all blog policies should be inclusivity. Moderators should treat divergent viewpoints with equal respect. History demonstrates that civility triumphs when members of a blogging community feel included."

It analyzes professional opinions on how Nigerias socioeconomic and political environment impacts public relations practice. Nigeria is one of four countries where public relations practice is guided by regulation. This research indicates that regulation in Nigeria exerts weak coercive isomorphic force because of ineffective enforcement. It does suggest, however, that regulation would be a strong coercive isomorphic force in an enabling socioeconomic and political environment. This research could serve as a tool for cross-cultural comparison of public relations practices in countries whose socioeconomic and political environments are akin to Nigerias."
2008-0222,Cognitive and Emotional Effects of Breast Cancer Survivor Testimonies,Traditional and Online Sources of Social Support,,,,Paper,Cognitive and Emotional Effects of Breast Cancer Survivor Testimonies,Traditional and Online Sources of Social Support,"This report on the impact of narrative and emotion on processing of breast cancer survivor messages is based on the heart rate and self-report data of 37 African American women, 40 years of age and older, who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer. Narrative messages with both pleasant and unpleasant emotion (mixed) showed the greatest heart rate deceleration while unpleasant narratives showed the least. However, non-narrative messages showed the opposite pattern of results, where unpleasant messages showed the greatest heart rate deceleration while non-narrative messages with mixed emotion showed the least. These data initially point to the conclusion that resource allocation for narrative material depends on valence of emotion expressed in the message. Also, there were significant main effects for narrative on efficacy and information seeking. Non-narrative messages were rated more efficacious and encouraged more information seeking than narrative ones. These data suggest that when breast cancer testimonies are expressed as narratives, several unintended outcomes occur."
2008-0223,Cognitive Appraisal of Primary Polls and Emotional Responses,Political Decision-Making,,,,Paper,Cognitive Appraisal of Primary Polls and Emotional Responses,Political Decision-Making,"In this study, we explore the ways in which newspaper articles about a primary poll elicit political voters emotions such as pride, joy, anxiety, and anger. We then examine whether these emotions affect the voters behavioral intentions to seek relevant information and to express political opinions. Employing the cognitive appraisal theory of discrete emotions, we propose a schematic model of appraisal regarding the changes of a candidates poll standing in terms of goal relevancy, goal congruency, and attribution. The model is applied to the situation in which voters find the changes of the major candidates poll standing in the coverage of the 2007 primary election for the Grand National Party in Korea. The application of the appraisal model enables us to expect that discrete emotions such as pride, joy, anxiety, and anger will be produced in the specified appraisal conditions. The data were collected from an experiment where newspaper stories were manipulated for each of the hypothesized conditions of cognitive appraisals. The results provided some support for the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion; Specific discrete emotions such as anxiety and anger were produced as hypothesized. In addition, it was found that while pride and anger affected expressing political opinions on the Internet, joy and anxiety influenced information seeking in news media."

In order to elucidate this phenomenon an experimental study (N=120) explored peer-conversations about a TV-news report and the way they affect memory and knowledge. 40 dyads (=experimental group) discussed the news after reception whereas 40 participants (=control group) processed it individually. Conversations were taped and coded. Recall and recognition were measured ex-post for all subjects on the individual level.
Results prove a stronger memory for the experimental group. Conversations reveal a high frequency of asking and answering questions regarding the news as well as processes of mutual reassurance, adjustment and enhancement. Thus, people check and revise their understanding and elaborate media contents in interpersonal communication. Cognitive media effects are thereby enhanced and accentuated as conversations improve the memory of certain relevant aspects of the media content."

This study looks at the mechanisms by which these new controllers facilitate entertainment including cognitive skill and presence. An experiment was
conducted in which subjects played the first person shooter Call of Duty using a traditional game controller system and a Nintendo Wii system. Results show that both systems facilitated high levels of flow and game performance. Both cognitive skill (variance explained = 27%; variance explained = 21%) and presence (variance

These collaborating groups represent one type of new organizational form that has received much attention in recent literature. These new organizational forms are enabled by information and communication technologies (ICTs) that allow for flexibility in response to a changing environment. However, little is known about how these new organizational forms use ICTs in turbulent environments such as that of disaster relief. Thus, this study seeks to understand how collaborative groups structure technology in crisis conditions and how this process of technology use then works to structure the collaborating group. This research contributes to existing understandings of collaborative group processes by demonstrating that conditions of crisis can promote initial unity between groups while technology use simultaneously structures the group towards divergent goals."

Won't people disagree over content, fight to express their point of view, even senselessly vandalize useful articles? Yes, yes, and yes, yet Wikipedians still produce a large number of useful articles on topics as controversial as abortion and as vanilla as chocolate--except that even for chocolate, bitter disputes arise.

I will give an overview of research and stories around Wikipedia and related projects, with the goal of understanding the conditions under which wiki technologies are likely to succeed in producing useful outcomes in the face of conflict, especially around political topics. Effective wiki collaboration relies on a mix of social norms, community policies, technical tools, and shared purpose. To the extent that political discourse communities can establish these requirements, wikis are likely to be useful in conducting such discourse."

Following their lines of heuristic reasoning, it examines how they integrated multiple cues into a coherent account. Based on a series of focus group interviews, the study traces the connections people drew between concepts in their own accounts, modelling considerations as paths across a semantic network. Analyzing the argument structures, the study identifies the schemata underlying peoples understandings, as well as the inferences relating these to the vote choice. It finds that people distilled little concrete information, but several general cues from the campaign. These were sufficient to render applicable various schemata, mainly in peoples prior understandings of European integration. People interpreted this knowledge in light of the referendum proposal, relying on various heuristics simultaneously. Framing the same information in different ways, they forged their considerations into a coherent narrative."

The study focuses on the figure of Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Centrals The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and on the stages and strategies in which Stewart was embedded into mainstream journalistic discourse, and in which journalists negotiated Stewarts definition, authority and position vis-à-vis the U.S. journalistic community. By examining the journalistic discourse over a period of 14 years and adopting a cultural, inter-textual, process-oriented approach, the paper seeks to go beyond the framework of paradigm repair and account for journalisms contradictory and changing identity, and for the ways it is shaped by a complex interplay between different players within and outside the journalistic community. The paper also suggests that Stewarts relatively successful co-optation was due to a fit between the normative and epistemological assumptions of three central players - the journalistic community, political communication scholars and Stewart himself."

Wrapping Health Messages With a Smile: The Potential of Entertainment-Education Programs for Children and Adolescents,,,,Paper,Commercials and Entertainment-Education: Distracting From or Supporting the Message?,Is Entertainment Better Information? Wrapping Health Messages With a Smile: The Potential of Entertainment-Education Programs for Children and Adolescents,"Televised Entertainment-Education (EE) content is always part of a larger program structure that includes commercials and other types of advertising. In some cases, the nature of the commercial (product, style, story) interferes with the educational message, for instance when fast food advertising is placed in the context of a program that promotes healthy food. Nevertheless, the process behind a presumed influence is ambiguous, as well as the direction of the effect: Does the conflicting message of a commercial reduce the impact of the educational content, as we might assume at first glance? Or does, on the other hand, the EE strategy even increase the impact of advertising?
To test this relationship, we conducted an experimental study among 192 third-graders in three elementary schools in Germany. Subjects were assigned to one of five conditions that varied educational content on nutrition and different types of advertising, including commercials for food products. Measures referred to food-related knowledge, attitudes and behavior; and to recall and recognition of commercials. Results indicate that a negative influence of advertising was smallest when the dose of educational content was highest in the program. Vice versa, the advertising effects were independent from the nature of the program, with information on healthy food not affecting the response to food-related commercials."

Specifically, it analyzes how the campaign source frames the key message, establishes dialogues and negotiates attitudinal and behavioral compliance with the targets. The findings revealed themes of being at ease with illness and death, determination throughout life and beyond death, blessing and joy of giving, foremost utilization of body usership, and values of life and meaning of death as the dominant persuasive discourses employed. The coding also identified a number of education-related metaphors that added persuasive traction to the identified themes. Implications of the findings for public communication are discussed."

As research on YouTube moves forward, however, it is important to avoid common misconceptions about it. Many of these misconceptions stem from researchers casual use of the site, and on analyses of posted videos. This paper draws on the findings of a 1-year ethnographic investigation of people who use the site in vastly different ways. It will problematize common generalizations such as: 1) YouTube is not a community; it is merely a site for watching poor quality videos; 2) Anonymity on YouTube is largely responsible for antagonistic encounters; 3) YouTube video makers focus on narcissistic content prevent meaningful social exchange and active civic engagement; 4) YouTube enables anyone to post and share videos; 5) YouTube shares key characteristics of other participatory cultures (Jenkins et al. 2006), such as the fact that people feel their contribution will be valued and those who are dissatisfied can simply leave the site. Ethnographic research suggests that YouTube is vast, with many different types of communities, desires, and abilities to participate evidenced across users and groups. Generalizations about any particular partial truth (Clifford 1986) may lead to flawed conclusions about YouTube and about human interaction in general."

This study explores ideologies of gender and female sexuality in HIV/AIDS communication in Kenya using ideological critique. The findings of the analysis support the premise that rhetorical arguments surrounding the intended message is a critical component of a meaningful narrative for the audience. Both hegemonic and counter-hegemonic ideas about gender and female sexuality are observed in the messages reiterating the need for a thorough understanding of the unintended range of ideas that a message communicates and the probable impact on gender related efficacy in the age of HIV/AIDS."

The communication variable is central to this theory, as influence and motivation, key characteristics of charismatic leadership, are communication based messages and behaviors.
Using terms that define both charisma and charismatic communication, a 42-item scale was developed to measure this concept. This scale is pre- and post-tested and a final 15-item version of the Charismatic Leadership Communication Scale (CLCS) emerges as both reliable and valid.
Hopefully future research will combine the CLCS with existing scales to address the entire theoretical construct of charismatic leadership."

They form part of a complex response to transnational media flows that includes both resistance and accommodation. Community media perform various social roles at the local level including the production of collective identities, the construction of meaning, negotiating proximities to power, enriching networks of social bonds, and enhancing individual capacities. Evaluating these roles has emerged as an under-theorized and yet critical area of investigation for better understanding the dynamic between local and global cultural production, how community media influences social formation and for articulating its social benefits to policy-makers and funding agencies. This paper proposes a framework for evaluating community media by mapping influence on collective capacities (i.e. community capital). An Outcomes Mapping Framework, which links community media outcomes to various forms of community capital, was tested for practicability in the field during the study of a small community television station in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada (Telile Community TV). This Framework proved useful in identifying: (i) the multifold ways that Telile TV has played a role in expanding local influence over social outcomes; (ii) indicators of social change causally linked to community television practice; and (iii) some of the strengths and weaknesses of extant community media practice within local media ecologies. The field results also revealed the critical importance of ontological context for evaluative assessments of community media practice. The process of ""mapping"" community development outcomes suggests that community television has multi-faceted potential for responding to tensions that arise in response to global flows and for expanding local cultural citizenships."
2008-0237,Communicating for Social Change: An Experimental Analysis of Activist Message Strategy Effect on Receiver Variables,"Communication, Activism, and Social Change",,,,Paper,Communicating for Social Change: An Experimental Analysis of Activist Message Strategy Effect on Receiver Variables,"Communication, Activism, and Social Change","Experimental methods were to explain the communication effects of activist message strategies derived from Hazleton and Longs Public Relations Process Model (1988) using J.E. Grunigs (1997) situational theory of publics and Fishbein and Ajzens (1975) theory of reasoned action. Nine hypotheses and two propositions were tested. Findings indicate that activist message strategies influence problem recognition, goal compatibility, attitude toward strategy, and attitude toward behavior. Persuasive and coercive message strategies were found to be the most effective in making publics more active toward an activist organizations cause. The results support and extend the situational theory of publics through the addition of goal compatibility as a predictor of information seeking behavior and the use of auxiliary items to operationalize information seeking behavior. Results also support the predictions of the theory of reasoned action. Subjective norm was found to be the most significant predictor of behavioral intent."

This dialogue engages community members and brings them closer to each other. The closeness developed among members of a community, in turn, helps to create community friendships. The community friendships, or the friendships developed in the public sphere are extremely important for generation and sustenance of a sense of a shared world among its members. They also enhance mutual cooperation and care within a community, which is critical for its holistic development and progressive social change. In other words, friendship depends on community (Aristotle, 1980, p. 207), and vice versa. In this paper, I use illustrations from my field research in India and Unites States to understand the relationship between performance and community. On a broader level, I draw upon C.S. Lewis, Merilyn Friedman, Mikhael Bakhtin and Dwight Conquergoods ideas to explore the role of performance in creating the process of dialogue and friendships within a community. Also, I build upon William Rawlinss work to define the basic tenets of friendship in a community setting."

In addition, this study focuses on whether there are differences among the five types of adopters. This study aims to better understand the adoption intention of new technology, mobile TV, among college students, using Rogers (1995) diffusion of innovations model to examine important factors that may influence the adoption intention and diffusion of mobile TV in the United States. The findings of this study would be useful to better understand how young college students, who might be early adopters of new technology, are interested in an innovation, mobile TV, and how they are likely to use it. In particular, these results would be valuable for future research on social impacts of digital mobile multimedia."
2008-0240,"Communicating Worldviews: Linguistic, Cultural, and Social Interaction",The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,,,,Paper,"Communicating Worldviews: Linguistic, Cultural, and Social Interaction",The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,"The traditional view on communication as a mere information exchange is hanging on although the new view is beginning to take hold. Not denying the traditional view on communication we will be surveying some data based on the assumption that communication is interaction of talking minds (M. Bakchtin) or linguistic minds (The Leontyevs). This abstract is concerned with describing: 1)linguistic, 2)cultural and 3)social issues of communication as worldview interaction.
1) Linguistic issues of communication are being taken into consideration due to the fact that a participant of communication makes use of a certain linguistic system. Worldview reflects not only ethnic but also linguistic peculiarities. There is a lot in the worldview what is predetermined by the language organization and its structure. Thus the tense system incompatibilities in three European languages under investigation (English, French and Russian) provide some data for studying time categories and time categorization peculiarities. For example the existence in French of the tense Passe Simple (Il descendit du train, sortit de la gare et gravit la pente conduisant à la cours des Miracles, un ancien palace qui servait dasile à une colonie de réfugiés polonais. Richard Morgiève «Un petit homme de dos») can be viewed as a reduplication phenomenon for «Passe Compose»: «Ils ont découvert//découvrirent un paysage qui sest révélé//se révéla splendid avec ses lacs innombrables et ses forêts aux couleurs automnales». Obviously, this evidence suggests more elaborated presentation of the idea of past actions in French than in Russian and English. On the other hand we also tend to see more detailed presentation of the idea of continuity in English than in French: «Il fait ce métier depuis trente ans». Lacking the well-developed tense system Russian is abundant in diminutives that are used to indicate the speakers attitude toward the subject as cute, charming, small, lovable, or the like.
2) Cultural issues of communication are being emphasized thanks to the assumption that participants of communication represent a particular culture with its typical realities, which linguistic embodiments when occurred in the discourse flow disturb the smoothness of communication. Every culture has the set of lacking concepts such as challenge, privacy, mainstream culture, dusha (soul) and so on. It is impossible to explain what is meant by such concepts; they are subconsciously perceived and can hardly be utterly articulated.
3) Social issues of communication are being singled out based on the premise that interlocutors represent particular societies with their political and economic ways of life and cultural values. Despite the diversity of individual characteristics and attributes it is possible to make generalizations about people of a culture because disregarding the overall globalization there are still mainstream values that reflect the essence as well as particularities of the culture. Certain ways of thinking, acting, and communicating are a direct result of cultural values and the processes of enculturation and socialization."
2008-0241,Communication and Learning in a Peer-Mentoring Program: A Qualitative Analysis of Electronic Mentor Journals,Teacher and Student Dynamics in Instructional Communication,,,,Paper,Communication and Learning in a Peer-Mentoring Program: A Qualitative Analysis of Electronic Mentor Journals,Teacher and Student Dynamics in Instructional Communication,"The University of Ottawa offers a peer-mentoring program and an associated training program for all mentors through its Student Academic Success Service (SASS). In addition to the formal training, some peer mentors receive feedback and support through an electronic journal system that records communication between mentors and their supervisor. As a transcript of the interaction between those peer-mentors who use the journal and their supervisor and a record of the mentors competency development, the journals provide a rich source of data. This project used an in-depth content analysis of 192 journals in order to assess the learning process experienced by the peer mentor. Using reflection-on-action (Schön, 1983) as a theoretical framework, this study explores the processes involved as peer-mentors reflect on and assess their own practices, and examines the role of dialogue, in the form of feedback provided by the supervisor, in this learning process."
2008-0242,"Communication and Normative Influence Over Contraceptive Use in Egypt, 1995-2005",Whats the Norm: Examining Social Influences in Health Behavior,,,,Paper,"Communication and Normative Influence Over Contraceptive Use in Egypt, 1995-2005",Whats the Norm: Examining Social Influences in Health Behavior,"In spite of accelerating attention to the relationship between communication and social norms, there are still significant gaps in how we explicate and measure normative concepts (Yanovitsky & Rimal, 2006). This paper explicates the collective dimension of norms and how it is related to individual behavioral choices and explores the role of communication in introducing and fostering social norms related to fertility control. We test these propositions using multilevel analysis of publicly available nationally representative data about contraceptive behavior at three points in time over a 10 year period from 1995-2005 in Egypt. Furthermore, because the emphasis of Egypts national population program shifted roughly midway through this period around the year 1999, we explore the extent to which this shift is reflected in changes in the normative drivers of behavior. Results indicate that norms measured at the collective level affect individual contraceptive use. However, the specific attitudinal and behavioral norms that influence individual action change over time consistent with shifts in the emphasis of the Egyptian national population communication program."
2008-0243,Communication Breakdowns in Collaborative Settings: The Influence of Visual Delay on Distributed Communication,Real Issues in Virtual Groups,,,,Paper,Communication Breakdowns in Collaborative Settings: The Influence of Visual Delay on Distributed Communication,Real Issues in Virtual Groups,"When pairs work together on a physical task, seeing a common workspace benefits their communication and transforms their language use. Previous results have demonstrated that shared visual information helps pairs to communicate the current state of their task and ground their conversations efficiently. However, technologies developed to support geographically distributed communication often impinge upon the visual information required to support such successful interactions. One example of this is the introduction of delayed visual feedback that often occurs in todays video-mediated communication technologies. This paper details the form of the functional relationship between visual delay and communicative performance. The results precisely demonstrates how a range of visual delays differentially impact communication and task performance, and illustrates the collaborative conversational strategies pairs employ in order to adapt to visual delays."

This policy prohibited media debates on the political and social implications of the economic reforms and opened the way for the implementation of what David Harvey has called neoliberalism with Chinese characteristics and the consolidation of dominant political economic and cultural power within and through the Chinese communication industries. However, as Chinas marginalized intellectual forces and disenfranchised social classes escalated their struggles against the negative consequences of the reforms in early 2000s, they threatened to break the no debate curse, turning Chinese media and cyberspace into key sites of contestation over the directions of the countrys social transformation. In examining the structures and dynamics of discursive contestation among elite and popular social forces over a number of key social economic issues between 2005 and 2007 in the so-called third debate on reform, this paper highlights the highly fluid nature of Chinas media and Internet discourses, while foregrounding the processes and mechanisms of capitalist instrumentalist mobilization in containing challenges against Chinas dominant political economic power relations from below."
2008-0245,Communication Effects: How Conversation Changes Media Effects,Conversation Effects: The Impact of Interpersonal Communication on Mass-Media Effects,,,,Paper,Communication Effects: How Conversation Changes Media Effects,Conversation Effects: The Impact of Interpersonal Communication on Mass-Media Effects,"Media effects occur on media users and on non-users, when the users talk about media messages and media experiences with non-users. The presentation discusses the effect of such conversations on media effects. When the course of conversation about media is consistent with the media effect on the users, the conversation will reinforce the effect on the user and diffuse the effect to the non-users. When the course of the conversation is contradictory to the original media effect, the effect on the media user will be suppressed by the conversation effect and the effect on the non-users will be an antagonistic effect compared to the original media effect. Therefore, the presentation explains the conditions under which (a) conversation about media will appear and (b) the conversation effect will be in line with the media effect. Finally, differences of conversation effects on emotional, cognitive and behavioral media effects are discussed."

The purpose of my project is to consider Chinas emergence as a dominant economic power and the implications for social change through an organizational communication lens. Specifically, I will discuss communicative challenges associated with managing transitional organizational forms such as international joint ventures. In addition, I will explore communicative challenges associated with leading non-governmental organizations, an organizational form that has only recently been allowed to operate in China (Pocha, 2006). While transitional organizational forms can help build economic strength, and non-governmental organizations can strengthen civil society in China, they both also involve considerable change and contradiction. An organizational communication lens may be particularly useful at this point in time to better understand the nature of those changes, the contradictions they create and the ways in which in those are recognized and suppressed; negotiated and silenced."
2008-0247,Communication Networks and Productivity: Rewiring Low Productivity Units' Networks to Match High Productivity Units' Networks,Current Research on Network-Based Approaches to Organizational Communication,,,,Paper,Communication Networks and Productivity: Rewiring Low Productivity Units' Networks to Match High Productivity Units' Networks,Current Research on Network-Based Approaches to Organizational Communication,"This paper reviews the literature on relationships of communication as well as communication network structures with organizational productivity. An hypothesis that flows from the literature is that higher network density is associated with higher productivity. We investigated associations between communication network structures and productivity in four vehicle assembly plants. Network analysis of communication about industrial materials use revealed that valued network density had an R2 of .97 with IM cost per unit produced. The highest productivity plants had IM network members communicating weekly or more often. We performed a triad census in each plant that also identified triad members so that we could propose a network rewiring intervention for three plants to change their networks to be similar to the highest productivity plant. The rewiring strategy is accurate, tractable, and reproducible."
2008-0248,Communication of Moral Emotions During an Organizational Crisis: Differential Effects of an Ashamed CEO and a Regretful CEO,"The Impact of Rationality, Veracity, Shame, and Regret on Message Processing",,,,Paper,Communication of Moral Emotions During an Organizational Crisis: Differential Effects of an Ashamed CEO and a Regretful CEO,"The Impact of Rationality, Veracity, Shame, and Regret on Message Processing","The current study addressed the role of communicating discrete moral emotions within the context of organizational wrongdoing. More specifically, we compared the effect of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) communicating regret versus shame over presumed misconduct. After reading a fictitious news article in which we manipulated the emotion communications, we assessed the sense of integrity people assigned to the CEO, and how trustworthy they perceived the organization. Results showed that people assigned the ashamed CEO more integrity than the regretful CEO, thereby positively fuelling trust in the discredited organization. However, it was also shown that this predicted effect was moderated by participants gender, as it appeared to only hold for women. Men did not differentiate in their evaluation of the CEO and his organization as a function of the emotion communication. A possible explanation for this gender effect is discussed in relation to different tolerance levels that exist between men and women when it comes to stereotypical beliefs about their emotional behavior. This study demonstrate that the effect of communicating emotions with regard to how the communicator is evaluated is contingent upon the specific emotion he communicates, and whether the receiver of this communication is male or female."

Indices of facilitating factors and of multiple behavioral outcomes were constructed for both countries. Analysis shows that exposure to health communication programs (focused on family health issues in Egypt and on HIV/AIDS prevention, testing and treatment in South Africa) was positively correlated with having more health competence facilitating factors, which in turn were positively correlated with a greater number of desirable health outcomes. Implications for the design and evaluation of integrated communication programs and for the sustainability of health outcomes over time are discussed."
2008-0250,"Communication Studies, Activism, and Rebuilding During the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans",Communication in Action: Scholarly Intervention at Local and National Levels,,,,Paper,"Communication Studies, Activism, and Rebuilding During the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans",Communication in Action: Scholarly Intervention at Local and National Levels,"This paper focuses on how communications faculty and students at a historically black university in New Orleans worked with a local non-profit group to act on community needs during the aftermath of the worst manmade disaster in the history of the United States - the levee breach after Hurricane Katrina. Under the direction of the community, students conducted a national media campaign to bring in volunteers to remove debris and gut houses in African American neighborhoods of lower socio-economic status. Students learned about community problems, how to conduct a media campaign, build websites, write for public relations, as well as develop a sense of empowerment as change agents. This campaign brought in over two thousand volunteers who contributed roughly $200,000 of free labor to people in need. Using this successful university/non-profit/community partnership as a case study, this paper theorizes on the role of communication departments as potential community change agents. An argument follows that extending knowledge and resources during crises situations should be expanded to address local needs during ""non-crisis"" situations through experiential and community-led pedagogies."
2008-0251,Communication That Damages Teamwork: The Dark Side of Teams,Problems and Possibilities in Group-Based Organizing,,,,Paper,Communication That Damages Teamwork: The Dark Side of Teams,Problems and Possibilities in Group-Based Organizing,"Teamwork is among the most examined topics, both in scholarly work and popular treatments (Bacon & Blyton, 2005; Gordon, 1992; Ju & Cushman, 1995; Larson & LaFasto, 1989; MacMillan, 2001; Stevens & Campion, 1994). Despite the dramatic increase in teams, and correlative focus on teamwork, aversion to collaborating with others in team structure is widespread. In this article we analyze, from a multilevel perspective, the causes and explanations for the dark side of teamwork. We begin by explicating teams with teamwork -- the bright side, including the dimensions along which teamwork must be built for teams to be effective. Next, we turn to the dark side, first conceptualizing it and then outlining a framework for understanding the dark side of teamwork. In the main portion of the article we identify and discuss numerous subordinate level (individual, dyad, subgroup), group level, and supraordinate level (organization, environment) factors that contribute to the dark side. We conclude with a cross-level illustration of a dark side dynamic, as well as the implications of our analysis of dark side dynamics that undermine teamwork."
2008-0252,Communicative Connection: A Theoretical Clarification of the Role of Teacher Immediacy in Classroom Communication,Teacher and Student Dynamics in Instructional Communication,,,,Paper,Communicative Connection: A Theoretical Clarification of the Role of Teacher Immediacy in Classroom Communication,Teacher and Student Dynamics in Instructional Communication,"For almost 30 years, instructional communication researchers have investigated the positive effects of teacher immediacy across a wide variety of educational contexts in the United States and abroad. Nevertheless, the nature of the link between immediacy and cognitive learning remains unclear, leading some researchers to conclude that teacher immediacy has little if any effect on cognitive learning outcomes. This essay introduces a theoretical framework that clarifies the role of teacher immediacy in the teaching-learning process. The tenets of Communicative Connection Theory posit that teacher immediacy cues create and sustain psychological connections with students, enhancing the interpersonal relationship within which teaching and learning occur. Although a meaningful teacher-student interpersonal relationship is not required for cognitive learning to occur, such a relationship does contribute to a positive learning environment with inherently greater potential for cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes to be achieved. Thus, Communicative Connection Theory positions teacher immediacy as a relational variable that enhances the classroom learning climate and, hence, student learning outcomes."
2008-0253,Communicative Media and Zoning of Public Interaction,Philosophy of Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,Communicative Media and Zoning of Public Interaction,Philosophy of Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"This paper aims to revisit and revise the Susan Drucker and Gary Gumperts urban communication research on zoning of public interaction with a theoretical account. For this, it suggests a concept of communicative media as media of exchange for human interactions and transactions in geographic context. This concept is devised to distinguish the idea of media of exchange in human social interactions on geographic space like zoned area from conventional notion of communication media such as mass media and emerging new electronic information and communication technologies. In order to develop the concept, this research at first critically reviews conventional concepts of communication and media and conceptualize them in more inclusive and sociological ways. Then, it draws on Talcott Parsons concept of exchange of media under the AGIL four-function paradigm in his system theory, Jürgen Habermas concepts of steering media in the theory of communicative action, and illocutionary and perlocutionary speech acts in John L. Austins speech acts theory. The possible types of communicative media are conceptualized and listed. Public space is reinterpreted with the concepts. Therefore, I argue that zoning effects can be assessed by investigating communicative media and their impacts on speech acts; vice versa, communicative media can be employed in normatively designing zoning districts for communities. Particularly, I assert that the concept of communicative media can be applied to design public places for community integration, civic engagement and democratic practices."

Whereas this understanding is rather taken for granted in research on media and minorities, empirical network studies are only rarely undertaken within media and communication studies. The paper takes this as a starting point to present the chances and values of qualitative network analyses for media and communication research on media and diasporic communities. Based on case studies using qualitative interviews and network visualisations (network cards), the paper discusses the communicative connectivity in the Turkish minority/diaspora community in Germany. It can be demonstrated that this community is marked by a high local biographical mobility, in which digital media (mobile phone, WWW, e-mail) are used to maintain communicative connectivity when being on the move. To describe this, network analyses are a highly helpful tool as they bring our attention to tendencies of an increasing internal integration in the use of digital media in minority groups in a new way."

Los Angeles has over 3000 murals, including many in Greater Crenshaw. These murals document a range of reactions to the demographic shifts in Greater Crenshaw. We explore the context of creation of these murals, and how their content (which often addresses themes of ethnic pride and/or diversity) reflects the patterns of tension and integration among these two communities. Moving beyond the content of individual murals, this paper discusses the ways that presence of and participation in community arts may strengthen bonds within African American and Latino resident groups, and provide opportunities for bridging between these two groups."

Using empirical methodology to develop a grounded theory, in-depth interviews were conducted with journalists from diverse media outlets in the area, while focus groups were used for triangulation. Based on the data analyzed, a tentative model of the differences that emerged is presented for further testing."

In a computer-assisted survey of 296 children (8-12 years) and 198 adults (18-30 years), we investigated at what age children reach adult levels of a) advertising recognition, and b) understanding of advertisings selling and persuasive intent. Our findings showed that around the age of 9-10, most children have reached an adult level of advertising recognition. However, at age 12, children have still not acquired an adult-like understanding of advertisings selling and persuasive intent. Finally, childrens understanding of the selling intent of advertising develops before their understanding of its persuasive intent."

Covariates relative to STI information-seeking on the Internet were used, as well. The study found statistical content was preferred across the three countries. More vivid visuals were preferred by adolescents from the U.S. but had no impact for the South African and Dutch adolescents. Dutch participants evaluated Web site characteristics lower on all criteria, suggesting a more open atmosphere for sexual health matters in that culture. Further cultural differences are discussed."

They focused on a relatively limited and homogeneous group of countries: the North American and Western European ones. But, may their findings be applicable abroad? My paper evaluates the strengths and the weaknesses of the three systems model proposed by the authors based on the analysis of the Brazilian media system. The paper explores the characteristics of the Brazilian media system in the light of the light of the four dimensions of analysis presented in Comparing Media Systems: 1) Structure of media markets; 2) Political parallelism; 3) Professionalism; 4) The role of the State. The purpose of this is to identify traits in common or significant differences between the Brazilian media system and the three models proposed by Hallin and Mancini. The paper also suggest that other variables, different from those discussed in Comparing Media Systems would be useful for a broadened, worldwide comparative study: the distinction between central and peripheral media systems, and the distinction between presidential or parliamentary governments. Finally, it discusses the limitations of the concept of political parallelism for analyzing the Brazilian political/media system, and propose to replace it with a schema that articulates two variables: the strength of the political parties and the degree of engagement of the media in the political activity in a given media system."
2008-0261,Comparing Private and Secret Information in Disclosure Decisions,Top Four Papers In Interpersonal Communication,,,,Paper,Comparing Private and Secret Information in Disclosure Decisions,Top Four Papers In Interpersonal Communication,"This study explored differences between secret and private disclosure decisions in non face-to-face disclosure reported by college students. Communication Privacy Management (Petronio, 2002) was used as a theoretical framework to investigate issues of boundary management of secret and private information. A survey design was utilized, measuring content of the disclosure, use of prior restraint phrases, relationship with the target, motivation to disclose, and target/discloser gender. Although there are various similarities and differences between secret and private information disclosure, certain topics are perceived to be secret while other topics are considered private, and use of prior restraint phrases vary by secret or private disclosure as well as by topic. Implications and directions for future research are explored."

Results revealed clear differences between the conversational styles of the PwS and carers. In the PwS sample, there was evidence of two distinct communication profiles. PwS with the first tended towards minimal responses, so that carers did much of the work in managing the conversations. Those with the second profile dominated the discourse, and carers were more reactive in their behaviour. The analysis also suggested differences in the conversational strategies employed by family and professional carers, perhaps reflecting different degrees of closeness and habit in the interactions. The graphical representations produced by Leximancer effectively illustrate the interactional complexities in these conversations. This paper suggests broader opportunities for computer-assisted exploration of the dynamics of intergroup communication."
2008-0263,Comparing the Persuasive Effects of Entertainment-Education and Educational Programming on Risky Sexual Behavior,x and the Media,,,,Paper,Comparing the Persuasive Effects of Entertainment-Education and Educational Programming on Risky Sexual Behavior,Sex and the Media,"While there is some evidence that exposure to entertainment media messages can increase risky sexual behavior, there is reason to believe that some of these messages may result in prosocial effects. Speculation and recent theorizing has suggested that entertainment-education may offer an effective way to reduce risky sexual behavior by gaining audiences attention and arousing less resistance than traditional persuasive messages. However, empirical comparisons of the relative effectiveness of these two types of persuasive messages are needed. In this study, 437 undergraduates participated in a three-wave panel experiment in which they viewed one of three TV programs (entertainment-education, education-only, or entertainment-only). Safe sex attitudes, intentions, and behaviors were measured two days before, immediately following, and two weeks after exposure. The results demonstrate: (1) the entertainment-education and education-only programs increased positive attitudes toward safe sex in the short, but not long-term; (2) for safe sex intentions, the entertainment-education but not the education-only program led to boomerang effects, particularly among male viewers; (3) none of the programs influenced safe sex behavior in the two weeks after exposure, but the entertainment-education program led to more discussion about birth control with friends, sexual partners, and/or doctors than the educational program. Discussion of the findings and suggestions for future research are provided."

Between Live Aid, Live 8, the ONE campaign and Save Darfur, Hollywood celebrities have emerged in groups to publicly decry issues of famine, civil war, childcare, refugees and HIV/AIDS in Africa. Most recently, U2 star Bono launched a business model called Product RED, where international retailers can sell a line of for-profit clothes and household goods that also raises money for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. This paper analyzes Gap RED within the social and cultural context of celebrity activist culture. It also seeks to investigate how Gap uses celebrities to simultaneously promote social justice and consumption, and to explore the contradictions that emerge from such disparate goals. Through textual analysis of the campaigns advertisements and product line, this research aims to explore some of the social and political economic implications of consuming for a social cause."

Despite the extensive scholarship that has probed the role of various campaign communications on news content, no studies to our knowledge have scrutinized their relative influence within a single analysis. This study fills a void in the literature by comparing the relative impact of news releases and political advertisements on media content during political campaigns. Adopting the perspective of agenda-building, we compare the contribution of news releases and ads as information subsidies that might affect both object and attribute salience. The study examined agenda-building relationships in nine statewide campaigns during the fall of 2006. Newspaper content along with news releases and ads from candidate Web sites were collected for content analysis. The findings showed that the salience of issues in both news releases and ads tended to be correlated with the salience of issues in news content. However, news releases were more effective than the ads in building news media agendas of issues. For second-level agenda building, the results showed that the salience of issue attributes in both news releases and political spots were often linked to the salience of issue attributes in news content. Ads appeared to be somewhat more consequential than news releases in building news media agendas of attributes. Overall, this study found that news releases in 2006 were more effective than political ads in first-level agenda-building, and that political advertising was more effective than news releases in second-level agenda-building."
2008-0266,Competition and Consensus in Social Networks: Does Disagreement Discourage Voter Turnout?,Political Decision-Making,,,,Paper,Competition and Consensus in Social Networks: Does Disagreement Discourage Voter Turnout?,Political Decision-Making,"Scholars studying the effects of political disagreement on participation have advanced competing propositions and mixed evidence to bear: disagreement in discussion networks either mobilizes or demobilizes voters. This paper proposes that the seeming contradiction is due to different conceptual definitions of disagreement. Briefly, researchers have implicitly defined and measured disagreement in the respondents political discussion network as either (a) competition between points of view, or (b) opposition to a persons view. This paper clarifies the distinction between two forms of disagreement, integrates past insights on its effects on turnout, and tests the hypothesized effects of network composition on voting, in a nationally representative sample of US adults. Results lend evidence to the main argument and demonstrate the differential effects of supportive, mixed and oppositional discussion networks on the likelihood of participation. Implications of this study to the deliberative versus participatory democracy trade-off are discussed in conclusion."

The Case of Nicaraguas Sexto Sentido,Dialoguing E-E: A Participant-Centered Exchange on Entertainment-Education Scholarship,"Complexity Science is a combination of theories that explain how Complex Adaptive Systems, such as societies, function and evolve. Its concepts and principles have been used to explain stock markets, eco-systems, and organizational change. If the mission of entertainment-education (E-E) is to promote social change, can Complexity Science be used to inform the design of E-E initiatives? For example, can a telenovela for social change have non-linear story lines? Can it present either/or questions to which the answer is yes? What happens if instead of Keep It Short and Simple we make it long and complicated? In other words, what would an entertainment-education telenovela informed by Complexity Science look like? How can Complexity Science enrich our approaches to Entertainment-Education? The present paper explores the case of the Nicaraguan telenovela Sexto Sentido as it applies principles derived from Complexity Science to serve as a catalyst to social change in Nicaraguan society."

In the 1990s the emergence of digital technology and ensuing economic, political and cultural trends put both not only the effectiveness but the idea of national broadcasting into question. The paper examines policy shifts in two countries, Canada and Finland, where broadcasting has historically been seen as an essential instrument in unifying a fragmented society. The paper traces the evolution of national broadcasting and its founding principles from the 1920s and 30s to the late 90s when both countries sought to implement new digital policies to strengthen the existing broadcasting system. The central question is how the founding principles of national broadcasting shaped the formation of new policies intended to address the opportunities and threats encountered in the global digital communications phase."

Despite of their pervasive existences in games, they often are not believable. At first glance Non Player Characters (NPCs) seem to do what they are supposed to do. However, it doesnt take long to notice that their behaviors are extremely limited. Recently, researchers including computer scientists working on interactive drama systems have recognized the importance of believable characters. In this paper, the character believability was defined after considering many theoretical frameworks. Also diverse believability paradigms was combined and categorized through a comprehensive literature survey. The analysis of believability qualities produced 5 key believability categories: appearance, personality, goals, emotions, and social relations. For NPC design and related researches, several principles of NPC design were suggested."

For this purpose, 20 definitions of trust, representing various disciplinary and intellectual perspectives, were reviewed and analyzed. Based upon this review, the utility of using the concept of trust to describe the relationship between audiences and news media is discussed. The analysis concludes that the concept of trust can be easily applied to news media contexts. Two distinguishable sides interact over a substantial period of time. The trusting audience cannot be certain about the character or intentions of journalists working in the news media. Though the risks are often not as consequential as in other cases, audiences receive potential gains from their interaction with the media, but also potential losses. If they trust media, they willingly expect that the interaction will lead to gains rather than losses."

Some have suggested that traditional news values make violence or conflict necessary for protests to gain media coverage. Although the assumption is that violent or conflict-depicting images draw the attention of news media and audience members, thus facilitating learning about the social issue, extant research does not suggest this will always be the case. The current study found that conflict-oriented imagery did not increase the likelihood of participants selecting a protest story in a web news environment or their comprehension of the story. Conflict imagery did, however, result in more negative attitudes toward the protesters and protest, lower estimates of its effectiveness, and less time devoted to reading the story when the issue was more, rather than less, personally relevant to participants."

While natural resource revenues, mostly from oil, have helped propel the economy forward in the past decade, this wealth masks as many issues as it solves. One of the most important areas needing attention is the myriad issue associated with health. In addition to high levels of HIV infection, Russia must cope with the growth of lifestyle diseases that other industrialized nations confront. Part of the means of management for health issues is the development of health communication practices that enhance the quality of health care delivery and the participation in best health practices by the population as a whole. This paper will discuss the state of health in Russia, the current practices in health communication, and suggest a research agenda for the near future with the aim at improving health communication across the nation."

Peoples knowledge, attitudes and assessments of flood events and flood risks is highly influenced by the mass media. The media communicate flood disasters with various kinds of terms, reaching from technical information about water levels to normative symbols as Genesis Flood or nature's revenge. In contrast, authorities responsible for flood protection and flood mitigation usually inform the public about security levels, warning situations or prevention measures with an almost technical terminology, hardly understandable for laymen. Therefore, the general public is confronted with numerous different terminologies and definitions and has to cope with this information flood. This paper addresses communication barriers resulting from these different terminologies and formulates recommendations for journalists and administration authorities to overcome these risk communication barriers."

Examining how Internet use is embedded in everyday routines and interactions, the paper examines the role of the Internet in fostering identities and senses of identification, and how it is used to construct and connect with peer cultures. The paper considers five types of Internet use  gaming, information-seeking, downloading, networking and shopping  and explores the ways in which, in relation to each of these five types of use, young peoples uses of the Internet differs from that of older people. Whilst most Internet use focuses on consumption and networking, there are uses that can be labelled enacting citizenship. The paper examines how broadband Internet works in this way, and the implications of such uses for involving younger people in the public sphere and civil society.

It specifically seeks to understand how the study of whiteness can be instrumental in delineating our understandings of brown within the articulation of race in a black/white binary. Using the work of post-colonial theorists, such a Frantz Fanon, Homi Bhabha, and Gayathri Chakravorty Spivak, the paper asks how, and in which ways, post-colonial identities are formed in relation to whiteness and what this relationship means in contemporary culture. Historically, especially in South Asia, colonization has resulted in the fetishizing of whiteness at the same time it is seen as a mark of imperialism. This contradictory relationship to a racial identity has become more complex following 9/11, creating a peculiar relationship to whiteness, where whiteness is not just the opposite of black, but the opposite of all things not white."

Drawing on evidence from the state of the field, this presentation considers the explanatory capability of prevailing conceptual models of popular communication for their applicability to the global arena. Is culture adequately recognized for its central role in the global context of popular communication? Are current understandings of social practices of media engagement sufficient? Are affective dimensions satisfactorily acknowledged? Drawing upon evidence from audience and fan studies and from global media research this presentation appraises the status of the field of popular communication in a global context."

Using a multidisciplinary approach combining legal theory, sociology and history of journalism, this study shows that the bylining process extended throughout the twentieth century at a far slower pace than indicated in previous research. It perceives news reporters as constrained authors whose slow and late attribution is the result of creative limitations set chiefly by organizational and commercial considerations. The bylining process progresses as follows: (a) Initial avoidance of bylining, thereby fostering an authoritative, impersonal voice. (b) Bylines promoting organizational goals only. (c) Bylines accorded to a select few staff writers, leading to inconsistency in attribution policy. (d) Papers lose control over selective crediting due to journalists pressure for public acclaim."

More specifically, it looks at how the process of identity negotiations takes place under a neoliberal economic ideology in an integrated global economy. By examining the WTO protest in Hong Kong and Hong Kong Disneyland, it is argued that the British colonial government-designed Hong Kong Chinese identity has been employed by the state even after decolonisation to justify the free market policies of this city-state. New international division of labour however probes to question naturalised social relations."

Having a MySpace page offers direct access to fans, but provides no guarantee that fans will take up that access. In this new environment, small sets of highly active fans come to serve crucial new roles as promoters and filters, becoming de facto taste makers and steering listeners toward new music. This paper presents a model of this phenomenon in the context of the Swedish independent music scene, where fans who write mp3 blogs, news sites, generate online archives, and book Swedish music clubs outside of Sweden are essential in exporting what would previously have been regional music to international audiences. Interviews with such active fans, musicians, and independent label executives are used to argue that these three agents work together to collaboratively construct international and local subcultures in which their shared interests can thrive.

The issue raises key questions of responsibility for governments, business and individuals. In this context, the definition of rights and duties in connection to greenhouse gas emissions has become the subject of a discursive battle, which has generated divides between industrialized and developing economies, and within each of these groups of countries. This paper will analyze a sample of political and media discourses from the USA, UK, Australia, Brazil, Portugal, China, India and Middle East countries, and address the following questions: How are the positions of these countries governments legitimated? How are their citizens economic, political and social rights and duties in relation to climate change constructed? How are the governments and citizens of other countries represented?"

The present investigation extends previous research by adding consumption of sports team-related media as a control variable. The author hypothesized that media consumption is positively correlated with sports identity salience and self-esteem, and also mediates the relationship between these two variables. This is because media consumption enhances positive distinctiveness for fans of the sports team, leading to higher self-esteem due to ability to seek information about the team they support. Data gathered from fans (N=103) of a major West Coast university football team confirmed the authors expectations that sports fans consumption of team-related media is positively correlated with sports identity salience and self-esteem."
2008-0282,Contentless Content Analysis: Flaws in a New Methodology for Analyzing Media Bias,LSI Approaches to Analyzing Media and Controversy,,,,Paper,Contentless Content Analysis: Flaws in a New Methodology for Analyzing Media Bias,LSI Approaches to Analyzing Media and Controversy,"This paper presents a critique of a new and controversial approach to analysis of media output that can best be called contentless content analysis. This methodology attempts to measure the slant or bias of media outlets by defining certain words or issues as liberal or conservative (Democratic or Republican) and then counting the number of times the word or issue is used/covered by the outlet. What is actually said or shown about the issue is not analyzed. The methodology has recently been extended from the academic literature to public policy.

The paper identifies four major concerns that are endemic to the approach:

 It fails to understand what it means for a reporter to cite a source.
 The selection of external referents to ascribe bias to media outlets is inevitably biased.
 Because it is difficult to grind through content, selectivity in coverage of citations leads to questions of unreprentativesness of the data.
 The creation of single indices to represent complex concepts is flawed.

The paper argues that the flaws are inherent in the methodology because it must decontectualize the analysis of content that is inherently contextual. In order to produce the large quantity of data that the methodology claims as its strength, it will destroy the meaning of content and encounter the other problems. Contentless content analysis claims to solve the subjectivity and small sample problems of traditional communications research, but the cure is worse than the disease."

Indeed, the war in Iraq is replete with examples that demonstrate the growing importance that information has on shaping public attitudes, which in turn has significant consequences for the operations and effectiveness of conflict. Of the many actors involved in todays information war, the U.S. governments Arabic language broadcaster Alhurra and the Qatari-based and funded Al-Jazeera represent two competing agents that have drawn much public controversy, though for largely divergent reasons. This paper examines the organizational goals and operations of both, looking at the roles that each has played as independent political actors in the region and world, as well as their attempts and abilities to influence public opinion. In order to demonstrate both similarities and differences, as well as successes and failures, this paper draws from interviews with representatives from both organizations, a narrow content analysis, and an historicization of particular departures that each has taken from other, more traditional media organizations operating in the region."
2008-0284,"Contested Kicks: Sneakers and Gay Masculinity, 1964-2007",Masculinities,,,,Paper,"Contested Kicks: Sneakers and Gay Masculinity, 1964-2007",Masculinities,"Numerous scholars have described the construction of selves through social interactions rather than innate characteristics, using models such as constitutive rhetoric, social construction, discur-sive production, and socialization. Within critical and cultural studies, particular interest has been paid to such processes within subcultures, examining how counterhegemonic and transgressive subjects are produced, organized, and affect social change. Among subcultures, fashion has been frequently examined as a strategic social arena for these processes. This paper examines social construction of identity in a case study of a particular fashion item within a particular subculture: mens athletic footwear as it relates to gender identity among gay men. The variable perceptions of sneakers as contributing to gay male masculinity or femininity are examined over several decades. Using historical research, interviews, and media analysis, the project revealed two general trajectories of sneakers gendering. Historically, butch gay (sub)subcultures have rejected sneakers as perpetuating stereotypes of gay men as feminine, whereas more recent and mainstream gays have embraced sneakers as emblematic of successfully heteronormative mas-culinity. An analysis of gay mens magazines supported these two apparently oppositional tra-jectories. However, a final examination of sneakers within contemporary gay fetish subcultures suggested a more complex process, rather than a simple historical shift or diametrically opposing views within gay male subcultures. Instead of a tidy dichotomy of butch/mainstream, I found that the case of the sneaker revealed a productive dialectic, a multidirectional, dialogic, and ulti-mately collective process that suggested the truly social nature of social construction of gender."

As a particular mode of applied scholarship, community engagement embodies a larger set of claims about the academys role in addressing social problems. In this study, I utilize qualitative analysis to gain insight into community engagement from the perspective of academics and community-based participants involved in enacting such a partnership. A two-day planning meeting provides a rich context to explore the politics and ethics involved with building bridges between academics and community members. The data reveal how conflicts between principles of equality and difference emerged in this partnership, further challenging assumptions that collaboration automatically engenders equitable practice. Drawing upon transnational feminist theorizing and supported by participants critiques, I demonstrate the practical importance of a model of community engagement rooted in conceptions of solidarity."

In recent times, India has emerged as the poster child for ICT and social change enthusiasts. My paper focuses on the globally recognized experiment in computer literacy and cultural competence in Seelampur, India. Specifically, I explore different narratives of technology in bringing social change - technology as a neutral instrument and technology in the context of complicated transnational flows of resources and power. In identifying my work with critical scholars, I ask the question of who controls and manages technology in the quest for modernity and social justice. This paper attempts to provide a new theoretical framework for understanding development interventions by focusing on the producers of ICT experiments namely the Indian new middle-class and the subjects who are the urban working poor."

First, I look at how digital technologies impact the reorganization of music industry. The dominant technological mediation of theidol star system in the late 1990s gives way to industrial reorganization toward concentration and integration across the information and communications technologies (ICTs) industries and the media/entertainment industries. Secondly, I discuss how digital technologies impacts the way we relate to music and to each other. It is suggested that digital technologies accelerate personal and social use of music and contribute to a diversified music culture. Lastly, I discuss how digital culture of music is framed by this industrial rearrangement. It is suggested that the ongoing digitalization radically transforms how we conceive the music industry, and renders the nature of music redefined and contested."

An argument is put forth that customizable media allow players to have control over the interaction and allow a sense of agency which contributes to their motivation and hence learning/performance outcomes. This in turn contributes to better learning/ performance outcomes. An experimental setup was done to investigate this relationship. A reverse significant relationship was found between customization and performance outcomes. The mediating variables, however, did not show any significant relationship."
2008-0290,Controversial Issues in Russian Communication Study,The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,,,,Paper,Controversial Issues in Russian Communication Study,The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,"While Communication Studies in North America and Western Europe is a well-developed field, in Russia it still has to establish itself as an independent discipline. It is not included in the list of specialties officially approved of by the Ministry of Education, which means that students cannot graduate as Communication Studies majors, and Ph. D. dissertations can be defended only in related fields, but not Communication Studies proper. The paper discusses the challenges Russian scholars have to face and the widely discussed controversial issues, such as:
 Which definition of communication  broad or narrow  is more acceptable?
 Which discipline should play the leading role in Communication Studies or should it be a multidisciplinary field?
 Should Communication Studies be a practically or theoretically oriented discipline?
 What are the most effective ways to institutionalize Communication Studies in Russia?
Since practically all the Russian Communication Studies scholars and educators have grown from other disciplines, they have to find a common ground that would help them overcome eclectic methodological approaches, absence of clearly defined theoretical bases and common terminology and allow them to use the advantages of interdisciplinary research principles.
However, it would not be fair to suppose that in Russia the discipline is developing along the same lines as it did in the West. The Russian long-term philosophical and linguistic tradition accounts for specific approaches towards different aspects of Communication Studies, and Russian scholars have a lot to offer for the development of the field., e. g. the investigation of speech communication and discourse (V. Bogdanov, O. Goikhman, O. Kamenskaya, V. Kashkin, M. Makarov, T. Nadeina, G. Pocheptsov, E. Tarasov, A. Voiskunsky), the relationship between consciousness and communication (B. Gasparov, V. Krasnykh, V. Shabes, I. Zimnaya), human communicative behavior (I. Sternin, I. Susov, T. Vinokur), etc. A number of works deal with the modeling of the communication process (S. Sukhih, V. Zelenskaya), communicative strategies, (O. Issers, E. Klyuev), nonverbal communication (I. Gorelov, G. Kreidlin,), computer-mediated communication (B. Gorodetsky, I. Rozina), phatic communion genres (V. Dementyev), and intercultural communication (L. Kulikova, O. Leontovich, S. Ter-Minasova). Recent publications analyze types, categories, structure of discourse, and culturally conditioned differences in its character (V. Kasevich, V. Karasik, M. Makarov, E. Sheigal).
Besides, there are a number of notions, which are widely used in the study of verbal communication in Russia, but are practically unknown to Western scholars, such as linguistic personality (Y. Karaulov, G. Bogin, Y. Apresyan, M. Kitaigorodskaya, V. Gak), concept and conceptosphere (D. Likhachov, Y. Stepanov, V. Karasik, I. Sternin, G. Slyshkin, S. Vorkachev) and others.
The main activities of the Russian Communication Association aimed at developing the discipline include:
1) promoting communication scholarship and education through its website and electronic resources;
2) organizing seminars and conferences;
3) publishing scholarly journals;
4) establishing contacts with foreign colleagues;
5) organizing national book competitions;
6) publicizing the disciplines scholarship and representing its interests in official circles, , etc."
2008-0291,"Conversation, Contrariness, Confrontation",Partisanship,,,,Paper,"Conversation, Contrariness, Confrontation",Partisanship,"This paper proposes a model of curricular influence on adolescent support for confrontational activism. We describe two pathways by which this process of activist identity formation occurs. In direct but mostly unintentional fashion, peer-oriented instruction cultivates support for confrontational activism via the promotion of deliberative dispositions such as a willingness to express opinions and an inclination to disagree in conversations. The second path of curricula influence runs through the family, as opposed to peer groups, but the same deliberative dispositions are at play in identity construction. In particular, the inclination to disagree can roust otherwise politically inert parents. In families with liberal parents, we predicted that student disagreement in conversations would activate parents ideological sensibilities so that their liberal values are more salient in childrearing. We surmised that the provocation of adolescent disagreement should interact with parent liberal identity, magnifying the effect of parent ideology on the likelihood that the adolescent will support confrontational activism. This two-path model of school influence was validated in an empirical evaluation of Kids Voting USA curricula as taught to high school students in Arizona, Colorado, and Florida."

The Department of Defense, the State Department, USAID, as well as numerous agencies and departments have introduced and expanded existing media oriented programs. However, discussion and academic analysis of international broadcasting efforts, media assistance programs, public diplomacy outreach campaigns, public affairs, and strategic information campaigns are typically presented and examined in isolation. As yet, there has been very little examination of the coordination, competition, and/or commonality between these efforts. Drawing upon qualitative interviews with government officials and an analysis of government reports and documents, this paper seeks to construct a systematic overview and analysis of US government attempts to intervene in the global media sphere and presents lessons learned."

The video, generally known as Mantou, used clips from the film Wu Ji (The Promise), and provided a humorous and sarcastic interpretation of the movie story. As Mantou became tremendously popular online, the director of the movie threatened to sue the video for copyright infringement, and it became the subject of a heated public debate in the media and online. Popular support for the video, mostly expressed online, soon developed into vehement, yet disorganized, expression of widespread frustration with the highly commercialized Chinese movie industry dominated by transnational capital. Meanwhile, domestic and transnational capital behind the movie, with the copyright law on their side, sought to suppress popular criticism in order to safeguard the prospect of profit-making based on manipulative commercial propaganda. The case of Mantou demonstrated the repressive power of capital, as well as the conflict between free speech and copyright, in the Chinese context."
2008-0294,Copyright Protection of Pornography in a Global Context,"Comparative Copyright: Classrooms, Pornography, and Treaties",,,,Paper,Copyright Protection of Pornography in a Global Context,"Comparative Copyright: Classrooms, Pornography, and Treaties","This paper explores the copyright protection for pornography in a global context, using U.S. obscenity and copyright law as the primary frame for legal analysis. Pornography was not eligible for legal protection, but was an object of regulation and censorship in the United States until the late 1970s.
Pornography has developed through at least three stages in the United States: 1) spinning off from illegal obscenity, 2) acquiring legitimization, and 3) qualifying for exclusive rights of reproduction. In the wake of the widespread proliferation of sexual materials and moral changes in the 1960s and 1970s, the court in Mitchell Brothers (1979) invalidated the old defenses of copyright infringement such as moral standard principle and property theory. The similar suits followed in both Western countries and Westernized countries such as Japan and Israel.
Conversely, Asian and Middle Eastern countries, laggards in terms of adopting communication technology such as video tape recorders, did not experience such a sexual revolution until the 1990s. Without the sexual and moral changes, pornography and obscenity are regarded as synonyms, and are both unacceptable candidates for copyright protection. In spite of the fact that pirated pornography is rampant in those countries, it is still impossible to copyright illegal sexual materials. Although these countries do not specifically deny copyright to pornography, pornography is generally prohibited and copyright protection is consequently ignored."

In this exploratory study, we interviewed IT or web managers, as well as analyzed the content and the features of their TV weblogs. First, social contagion, management fashion, and some perceived characteristics of blogging (communicability, low cost, observability, complexity, and compatible) were found to be main factors that affect decision making to adopt this innovation. Second, the content and operation strategies of corporate blogs in the cases were immature. Positioned as a subsidiary web service, corporate blogs were mainly used for publicizing programming and artistes and enhancing customer relationship. Finally, with respect to blogging relationship maintenance strategies (Cho & Huh, 2007), this study found Taiwans TV corporate blogs require more improvement in blog policy setting (assurance), accessibility to representatives and decision making processes (access), and frequently update content (sharing task)."

2008-0297,Correlates of Fatalistic Beliefs Regarding Cancer Prevention,Risk Perceptions and Fatalism in Health,,,,Paper,Correlates of Fatalistic Beliefs Regarding Cancer Prevention,Risk Perceptions and Fatalism in Health,"Cancer fatalism, as defined in the present paper, indicates a sense of powerlessness and hopelessness when individuals currently free from the disease are presented with cancer related issues in the media. Confronting cancer information with a sense of hopelessness can decrease response efficacy, leading to less engagement in prevention and lifestyle behaviors (e.g., exercise and healthy eating), and potentially adversely affecting cancer-related health outcomes. Thus, it may prove important to determine which factors are associated with cancer fatalism. Toward this end, I examine correlates of cancer fatalism in a large cross-sectional national probability sample of adults aged 40-70 years. Results indicate that age, education, personal health, and health orientation negatively associate with fatalistic beliefs and personal cancer history positively associates with fatalistic beliefs. Importantly, it appears that seeking and scanning for cancer related information in the media are correlated with decreased cancer fatalism. Although, causal order cannot be determined from these analyses, it is possible that cancer-related media information may buffer individuals from fatalistic beliefs regarding cancer."

We examined the correlates of a well-validated measure of Internet addiction (Young, 1998a) with three hundred fifteen students (39% male). Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that academic year, subjects? Internet use, low self-esteem, likelihood of negative outcomes and importance of positive outcomes all contributed to the prediction of Internet addiction. Subjects who anticipated that negative outcomes (e.g., stalked online, ID stolen) were more likely to happen to them than to peers were none-the-less more likely to engage in problematic use. The more important positive outcomes (e.g., meeting new people, playing games) were the greater the Internet addiction. The importance of maintaining their preexisting relationships (family and friends), gender, and sensation-seeking were not associated with problematic Internet use after the psychological variables were included. A post-hoc path model was proposed that integrated all of the findings, expected and unexpected."

But despite HIV prevention campaigns designed to halt the spread of the virus, infection rates continue to rise. This research study examines how Black female perception of HIV infection risk affects attention to and remembrance of HIV/AIDS messages in magazines by employing qualitative (in-depth interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires and memory tests) data obtained from Black females aged 18-35 years. Results reveal that female respondents believe that ones personal perception of risk influences the amount of attention devoted to and subsequently what is remembered about HIV/AIDS magazine articles. Black women perceive their susceptibility to HIV infection based on a host of factors including varying levels of sexual activity and sexual risk-taking (i.e. unsafe sexual behaviors), the perceived security from participation in a committed, monogamous relationship, the likelihood of encountering a Down Low Black bisexual man in romantic situations, first-hand experience with individuals directly affected by the disease and exposure to HIV/AIDS-related media message that enumerate risk statistics and infection trends. Thus, quantitative statistical data obtained from questionnaire responses bolstered conclusions drawn from in-depth interviews. This project seeks to simultaneously refine and create knowledge and understanding pertaining to the ways in which African-American women (a major risk constituent group) negotiate sexual behavior, perceptions of personal sexual risk and media usage to combat HIV infection."

People suffering from them are seen as patients in need of help. Such help typically consists of therapy and takes place in structured organizational environments. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) sufferers do not define themselves as patients but as making a lifestyle choice and organize themselves around websites teaching them how to sabotage their therapy or other interventions covertly. These pro-anorexia websites create a counter culture, offering support and coping mechanisms and counteracting the health messages and interventions offered by conventional health care organizations. In dealing with this issue, health care organizations must learn to deal with these countercultures. Our data show that up to 10 per cent of Flemish young girls aged 12 to 13 have visited such websites, suggesting this is a large and well-oiled network that should not be underestimated."

Lynn Turner discusses a service learning assignment where students use their communication skills to create a workshop for an after-school program working to keep inner city at-risk kids in school. Stacy Tye-Williams details an assignment where students do fundraising for charity in small group communication, and Sarah Bonewits Feldner explains how her students read Catholic documents addressing issues of work and labor to allow her to tie social justice in to organizational communication."
2008-0302,"Creating Recognition for Employee Recognition: A Case Study on Marketing Persuasion, Public Relations, and Branding",Top Student Papers in Public Relations,,,,Paper,"Creating Recognition for Employee Recognition: A Case Study on Marketing Persuasion, Public Relations, and Branding",Top Student Papers in Public Relations,"Much has been debated about persuasion in public relations, especially with respect to the role of public relations in marketing communication. Professionally, public relations is often integrated with marketing to produce a unified front to consumers and stakeholders. However, this approach has been questioned in scholarly literature: To imbue public relations with marketing persuasion would damage the credibility of a role that is meant to be an advocate for public interests and a public liaison within the organization.
In order to understand the role of public relations within a marketing context, this study examines the communication objectives and processes of the global employee recognition firm, O.C. Tanner. Through an in-depth case study of the organization, this study reveals an under-examined role of public relations within marketing communicationto create the corporate brandand demonstrates how public relations can be integrated with marketing communication without damaging the credibility of PR. This study fills a gap in public relations literature, where brand management has been under-developed, and enhances understanding for the practical use of the integrated communication model. From these findings, future research opportunities are identified to understand integrated communication, and public relations place in defining the organizational brand. Furthermore, this case reveals an under-analyzed type of marketing persuasionthat is, public relations as educationthat builds relationships with stakeholders without compromising the integrity of public relations practice."

Attempts at visualizing the spatial patterns and distribution of criminal behavior share in their formal properties both with techniques of map making more generally, and with the broader visual culture of crime. Despite the sophisticated new technology through which these renderings are made, they nevertheless promote outmoded interpretations that emphasize the most visible, sensational, and racially inflected instances of criminal behavior. While the adoption of such mapping programs are justified using the rhetoric of community empowerment, their use of iconography supports a conservative law and order agenda. In the aesthetic rendering of illegality, place is represented with the aim of revealing information with a social purpose, yet it re-imagines real space according to prevailing police values about the nature of crime, criminals and urban space."

Public broadcasters are even justified by it. Yet, viewer ratings show a declining interest in classic quality genres such as news and documentaries, and not just among the younger generation. Does the quality audience no longer exist or does quality programming no longer appeal to what could be termed the quality audience? This paper answers to the crisis in quality television by revealing the outcome of a large-scale qualitative audience study of the changing taste and media use of 251 active, articulate, well-educated, socially involved citizens as well as media users who given their passion for and interest in media can be considered as an audience of experts."

We develop and deliver cutting-edge curricula and innovative programs supporting critical thinking and creative media production. The result: increased health and well being based on the ability to access and understand media. The Media Education, Arts and Literacy (MEAL) program evaluation confirmed that implementation of media literacy education curriculum produced significant educational benefits for students. MEAL was conducted in under-served middle schools in San Francisco and funded by the U.S. Dept. of Education. The goal of the project was to demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating media literacy and media production into core middle school curriculum. Test scores over two years demonstrated increased skill levels in critical and creative thinking skills. With 16 sixth and seventh grade teachers trained from two schools, 444 students produced media projects and digital portfolios demonstrating their work."

Theories of critical development communication provide both normative criteria for and alternative ways of development processes at individual, communal, and global levels. Recognizing underlying power relations, theories of critical development communication contribute to understand dialectical communicative relations between participant social actors within the diasporic pubic sphere. Built on discussions of critical development communication, this research tries to explore the processes of collective communicative actions of migrant workers in Korea. In particular, the study will discuss the relations of structural conditions and the communicative processes for migrant workers through the analysis of the qualitative data drawn from the field research at the Migrant Workers Television in Korea"

The African Transformation kit comprises a series of nine profiles of women and men who overcame gender barriers and challenges in their own lives and became role models to others. The profiles are viewed and discussed during interactive community-based workshops led by trained facilitators using the AT Guide. Participants were invited to take part in nine unique 2-hour sessions over the course of a week or more. Using a post-test only control group design, the research team conducted a survey of 225 AT participants and 224 non-participants in July 2006 to evaluate the effects of participation. Multivariate logistic regressions, controlling for socio-economic variables, found that participation in AT workshops was positively and significantly associated with equitable gender normative beliefs, shared decision making, efficacy to assume non-traditional roles, and the propensity to take part in community activities to eliminate harmful gender traditions, among other actions."

Transnationalism scholars define transnational practices as economic, political, and socio-cultural occupations and activities that require regular long-term contacts across borders to be successful. Some of these activities have been increasingly linked to debates about identity and belonging, as well as discourses about immigrant incorporation, participation, and citizenship both in the home and host lands. These debates allow for the formulation of important research questions regarding the existence of an arena of cross-national social, cultural, political, and economic exchange. Are cross-border communication and citizenship activities performed by immigrants undermining or strengthening the role of the nation-state? Is transnational political organization a way for immigrants to gain formal political representation in their receiving countries? If that is the case, which state is to be held accountable for responding institutionally to the requests of this cross-national public? If a transnational public sphere is being formed, is it possible to have arrangements for transnational citizenship among countries as dissimilar as Mexico and the United States?
The study of cross-border activities by performed by Mexican immigrant organizations in the United States, offers an empirical way to assess these questions. Traditionally many first generation Mexican immigrants have organized in social clubs or hometown associations, which are mutual organizations and sports or cultural clubs based on the specific state of origin of their members. Participating in hometown associations, known in Spanish as clubes de oriundos, is one of the main voluntary activities among first generation Mexican immigrants in many cities in the United States. Other social and civic activities are related to faith groups, cultural associations, and unions, among others."

Significant results employing logistic regression on questionnaire data revealed that Latin American employees who were sexually harassed did not show significant decreases in job satisfaction; however, when the same populations were targets of the more serious offense of sexual aggression, they did report significant decreases in job satisfaction. Given the contrast between these results and the results of previous US studies, these findings indicate that there are cross-cultural differences in perceptions of sexual harassment. Differences in cultural values were analyzed using Hofstedes (2001) cultural dimensions. Further research with regard to the managerial nature of these perceptual differences is indicated."
2008-0310,Cruel Pleasures: Smiling at the Suffering of Others,Visual Communication Studies Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Extended Abstract,Cruel Pleasures: Smiling at the Suffering of Others,Visual Communication Studies Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"The suggested paper (poster) is work in progress. The empirical analysis of examples of cheering crowds at cruel events of torture and killing of other human beings has not been concluded at the time of submitting this proposal. The visual content analysis of selected images of human suffering and cheering crowds is based on an iconographical analysis. The sample of images is mainly taken from weblogs and complemented with images of art works to demonstrate the continuity of the suggested types of images. The final poster will feature an iconographical typology of cruel pleasure depictions in history and in contemporary times.
Smiling at suffering is recorded world wide from different cultural settings and time periods. This poster demonstrates the examples of laughing spectators and laughing perpetrators of suffering in a comparative framework and it seeks common motives in the way that degrading of suffering is communicated. By using iconology, the poster links visuals of smiling spectators and smiling perpetrators to each other based on their logic and structure. It identifies the potential meanings of the smiles in the visuals and concludes that the spectators smiles disregarding the suffering of others ultimately lead not only to dehumanizing the depicted victims, but also the dehumanization of the spectators themselves."

New Internet-based tools allow users to easily communicate with global audiences, and many people choose to make personal and often intimate information available to this audience. At the same time, a culture that rewards the public performance of private thoughts and emotions is increasingly evident in the form of reality television (RTV) programming. This study examined RTV consumption, in addition to locus of control, authoritarianism, concern for privacy, and strong tie network size, as potential antecedents for non-directed self-disclosure via blogs, online photo sharing, and online video sharing. RTV consumption correlated with blogging and video sharing, but not photo sharing. Strong tie network size was a significant correlate of photo sharing, indicating that photo sharing may be a more relational activity. These findings suggest that linkages between online behavior and broader media cultures warrant further scholarly attention."

The notion of subactivism is introduced as a means for grasping the significance of subjects positioning with respect to political, social and ethical issues in daily thought and action. The role of the Internet in facilitating such processes is evaluated on the basis of data collected through in-depth interviews in households and focus groups in Calgary, Canada. The focus in this analysis is on young people and their Internet-related practices. A spectrum of use genres from entertainment through interpersonal and group communication to blogging is outlined and inspected with the objective to isolate critical points in which the Internet becomes a vehicle employed by young users to engage with issues, ideas and collective bodies representing the public realm.

This research focuses on the preliminary efforts of a large hospital networks cultural competency study. The research question is, How does a diverse patient population perceive the cultural competency of the staff they encounter? By institutionalizing a culturally sensitive perspective this hospital network will not only meet the mandates of governing structures at a national level (i.e. the Institute of Medicine and their report on health care quality*), patient care will be positively impacted and employees and the community will become more appreciative of diversity."
2008-0314,Cultural Diversity in the News Media: A Democratic or a Commercial Need?,The Consequences of Bottom-Line Journalism,,,,Paper,Cultural Diversity in the News Media: A Democratic or a Commercial Need?,The Consequences of Bottom-Line Journalism,"This paper distinguishes between laissez-faire and interventionist models to justify and implement cultural diversity policies in the news media. The paper argues that the laissez-faire model is characteristic of U.S journalism. However the convergence of media systems and the widespread adoption of diversity management practices threaten to turn the laissez-fair model into the prevalent model throughout other Western democracies and Europe in particular. The problem with this approach to media diversity is that it relies on commercial instead of normative justifications. As a result, cultural diversity is mostly reduced to an ornament. Equated with accuracy and treated as a business asset, diversity serves rather than challenges the existing media system. By failing to open sufficient spaces for alternative social voices, business-driven media policies do not respond to the democratic needs of a multicultural society."

It demonstrates that embedded in the face concept are culture-specific notions of personhood that give rise to culture-specific models of interpersonal communication: the individual based, self-oriented, and rational American face is enacted through an information game model of social interaction whereas the relation-based, other-directed, and emotional Chinese face is performed via a relationship game model of interpersonal communication. A call for more empirical research of Chinese interpersonal communication from a cultural perspective is also made."

However, globalization has brought about or reinvents the concept of workspaces such that work is no longer confined to a traditional space in a specific geographical setting where individuals are restricted to face-to-face (FtF) meetings and interactions. Rather, globalization has created the idea of virtual workspaces wherein collaborations and communication interactions occur with the aid of information communication technologies (ICTs) in order to allow collaboration among workers across different geographical boundaries. Virtual workspaces, however, also bring into the foreground the issue of culture and its effect on behaviors and communication interactions. This discussion explores the role of culture and social implications in virtual workspaces. At the same time, an attempt is made to address adaptation from traditional to virtual workspaces. The objective of researching and reporting on the transition of traditional to virtual workspaces is to offer organizations and their members or other practitioners a way to address differences in cultures and social impacts, while fostering effective collaboration in virtual workspaces that facilitates the globalization process."

By applying Karlyn Kohrs Campbells notion of agency, along with ideas from Adornos culture industry, to Habermass public sphere model the praxis of culture jamming can be explored. Culture jamming is not only an example of agency in action, it is also a form of resistance which encourages and triggers agency in others."

The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, the link between culture and values are revisited. Second, three major approaches to universal value orientation frameworks, Hofstede, Inglehart, & Schwartz, were revisited (Hofstede, 1980; 1983; 2001; Ingleharts, 1997; 2006; and Schwartz, 1994; 1999). Then, three universal value frameworks are compared and contrasted on various issues.

Specifically, we operationalize impulse buying tendency to measure individual differences, pleasure to measure emotional response, three constructs  including information quality, perceived trust and usage of interactive features  to measure shopping environment, urge to buy impulsively to measure impulsive purchase, and intention to purchase to measure the actual purchase. To examine the proposed hypotheses, a survey of 115 undergraduate students was conducted. The results show that websites information quality and customers usage of interactive features can affect their impulsive purchase behavior. This finding contributes towards the understanding of impulsive e-shopping and also suggests useful implications for practice and research."

Effects of Media and Social Pressure on Behavioral Intentions to Get Cosmetic Surgery",Perspectives on Entertainment,"The study draws from the literature on media effects, social norms, and body image to investigate the relationship between media exposure, consumption, and cosmetic surgery behavioral intentions. Results suggest that the medias emphasis on appearance creates the perception that cosmetic surgery is widely accepted, making people not only feel bad about their bodies but also contemplate getting cosmetic surgery in the future. These finding suggest a theoretical extension of cumulative cultivation effect: higher exposure leads to the altered perceptions of reality, but also manifests itself as a potential behavioral change. Results demonstrate that social media use differs from more conventional media exposure approaches. Specifically, viewing TV programs socially with friends, as well as socially discussing magazine articles and music videos, actually decreases the likelihood of cosmetic surgery behavioral intentions. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical attempt to investigate these complex relationships."
2008-0323,Cutting Edge Atavism: Appropriation and Control in Creative Work,Power and Value Under Neoliberalism,,,,Paper,Cutting Edge Atavism: Appropriation and Control in Creative Work,Power and Value Under Neoliberalism,"In this presentation I approach cultural labor in terms of its political-economic and historical/theoretical relationship with other forms of work in market society, with a particular concern for issues of autonomy, appropriation and alienation. My analytic and empirical focus is on the ""lines"" that are drawn in custom and law between those whose creative labor produces inalienable property - and thus the potential material-legal basis for resistance to particular forms of domination and dispossession - and those whose creative labor produces alienable property - and thus only claims on wages (and other contractually determined benefits), roughly, that is, between authors/owners and employees. These two general categories are understood to express a limited range of relations of domination and dispossession; the lines between these categories are political and their placement is determined through struggles that are particular to each cultural field and given historical contexts. To demonstrate the cultural significance and conceptualization of these categories, I draw on examples of their representation in films and television programs about popular music production.

This analytical framework supports the analysis of cultural work not only as on a continuum with other forms of work in market society, but also as a site of the reiteration of supposedly long-finished processes and conditions of appropriation and domination (such as ""proletarianization"" and ""coercion""). This approach, moreover, provides a way of analyzing and evaluating the contemporary proliferation of fiction and nonfiction representations of cultural work with respect to the ongoing reorganization of work under expanding neoliberal political-economic regimes."

This paper proposes cyber-vetting as a crucial area of future study in organizational communication. Preliminary evidence from surveys, popular media, and trade journals suggest the practice of cyber-vetting and/or perceptions of cyber-vetting are growing. Cyber-vetting is organizationally and communicatively situated given its context within new communication technologies and its impact on professional identity, work, and organizational practices including organizational selection and socialization. This paper argues for the use of Martins (1992) three epistemological lenses in researching cyber-vetting: interpretive, functional, and critical to best understand the practices, perceptions, and implications of cyber-vetting."
2008-0326,Dalit Identity Formation and Media Use in India,"Media, Identity and Use",,,,Paper,Dalit Identity Formation and Media Use in India,"Media, Identity and Use","This paper investigates the extent to which the Internet can facilitate the mobilization of Indias rural Dalits (untouchables) even though access is entirely urban and the language used online is largely English. We center our analysis and discussion of this potential around a 2003 Internet campaign waged by activists after the alleged beating of a Dalit employee by a Brahmin executive at a non-governmental organization devoted to rural development. While the e-mail campaign addressed the immediate indignities of the event, the millennia-old oppressions of untouchability were a dominant subtext. Even though a small minority of educated Dalits in recent years has become economically viable and with access to both the Internet and the English language, they are yet to fashion a counter-hegemonic public sphere. We posit that existing political and media theories are inadequate to explain the dynamics of Dalit identity formation and media use in 21st-century India. In our analysis, we take issue with the prevailing NGO strategy that maps Dalits as local and autonomous, and argue for the re-imagining of Dalits as a pan-national community."

The project she argued benefited a few at the expense of the poor and illiterate and the anti-dam protest was more than a fight to save the river valley, it was a question of justice in Indian democracy. However, the pro-dam lobby, whose views were represented in a formal reply by civil society activist BG Verghese, dismissed her careful scholarship and powerful prose as mere Poetic Licence - an anti-development diatribe not based on evidence. Ironic tropes, critics argue, render the text open to polysemic readings. However, the Narmada dam debate reveals that there is preferred reading of the text and a deliberate misreading of the author?s intent that is hard to explain as mere effect of the textual characteristics of irony as a rhetorical trope. The paper argues that the current theories of irony only clarify why ironic texts are open to multiple interpretations. They are unable to explain the misreading or preferred readings of text as they do not take into account the evidence of reception of the text or pay adequate heed to the surrounding context. This paper calls for a more reader-centered approach to interpretation of ironic text which takes into consideration a formal evidence of reception and the context of communication."

The market-based model is associated with the rise of ?soft? and domesticated news. The public-service model, on the other hand, is characterized by a greater commitment to the substantive and global content of news programming. The research described here tests the hypothesis that cross-national differences in public awareness of international affairs are attributable to both differences in the supply of international news and differences in citizens? demand for information.

We focus on Switzerland and the United States as representative of the public service and market-based media systems respectively. We measured public awareness of both ?hard? news and ?soft? news subject matter. Simultaneously, we compared the level of news coverage accorded specific ?target? subjects in major Swiss and US news organizations and the level of attentiveness to news among Swiss and US nationals. Our results revealed significant cross-national differences in the supply of hard news, the demand for news, and public knowledge. Swiss media provided more hard news coverage than US media, Swiss citizens reported using the news media more extensively than Americans, and the Swiss were considerably more informed than the Americans on questions of hard news. Using a multi-level model, we demonstrate that the effects of hard news supply on hard news knowledge are stronger in Switzerland and that the greater availability of international news has the effect of reducing the knowledge gap between more and less attentive Swiss."

Two radical music conditions (gangsta rap and white power rock) and one mainstream music condition (pop music) as control were used. Results indicate that white power music had the strongest effect on listeners wherein funding for White-Americans increased significantly while funding for African-American and Arab-American groups decreased. Funding allocation did not differ between the gangsta rap and pop music conditions. The results suggest that radical rap has become so common that it hardly affects listeners anymore."

After fifty-five years it is still intact, stranded between the living and the dead. Because of the enormous impact of Eva Perón on Argentine history and politics, the corpse functions as a physical locus for a range of emotional, political, and cultural affect. What kind of communicative processes structure audience encounters with mediated representations of this corpse? In particular, how does the corpse represent death, or mediate between lived experience and the knowledge of death? I begin with Heideggers distinction between human consciousness as an orientation towards death, and the given nature of the physical world. Using this distinction, I argue that the communicative structure of the corpse is the archive, a locus where cultural representations of death are stored, and from which they are redeployed. In so doing, I hope to open up a wider discussion about the relationship between embodied experience and archival media. A phenomenological method, because of the central importance it places upon the subject/object relation, is key to the developing discussion of these vital issues in our field."

Firstly, the study analyzes the extant discourses of HIV/AIDS and social change in India and then investigates whether such discourses are perpetuated or undergone a change in the campaign. Articulation theory proves a particularly useful lens to illustrate the discursive constructions in the campaign, and to investigate how the relations among various discourses are a result of hegemonic articulation. This research posits that there is a shift in the discourses of social change and HIV/AIDS in India that is reflected in the operationalization of the campaign. The campaign incorporates a socio-cultural and glocal approach involving the common person in AIDS prevention messages, which was unheard of in India, given the taboo attached to HIV/AIDS."

The twin foci of this paper are: What makes a successful box-office film part of the film canon and how was Amitabh Bachchans superstardom fashioned? Yash Chopras seminal Deewar/Wall, a critical 1970s film prototype, prompted analysis of the iconic hero Bachchan popularized, facilitating comparisons to film heroes before and after him who became indices of continuities and ruptures in cultural flux. Summoning Stuart Halls refinement of Roland Barthes polysemic text, this paper examines Deewars success: multiple meanings are available to a diverse audience in a film melding the melodramatic family saga, action, and the musical with oblique socio-political commentary. A throwback to another classic from the 1950s, the film reworks a narrative structure centered on the mother-son bond, a relationship bearing near mythic status in Indian culture. Deftly meshing the unusually intense emotional pitch this generates with the political climate on the eve of Indira Gandhis notorious 1975 national Emergency that suspended citizens rights, this 70s film provides a benchmark, a link between films of the 1950s and their 1990s reconfiguration as slick gangster movies. Following trends in genre development and cycles afford insights into cultural shifts, challenging the common assumption about the absence of genre in Indian cinema. Deewar is equally important for Amitabh Bachchan s emergent star power produced through the confluence of onscreen performance, the work of industry personnel, such as the screenwriter duo, Javed Akhtar and Saleem Khan, and well orchestrated off-screen narratives about the star, extraordinarily blurring fact and fiction. A close reading of the film long after its heyday resonates powerfully with the stars trajectory serving as an uncanny master text, a register against which Bachchans star power becomes legible. Taking together the film text, context, its role as a star vehicle, and the interface between the 1950s and 90s, this paper explores the canonical status due to Deewar, a quintessential 70s popular Hindi film."

2008-0334,Defining Media Publics,Reconfiguring the Public,,,,Paper,Defining Media Publics,Reconfiguring the Public,"This paper will explore an emerging definition of public media as media projects or outlets that intentionally inform and mobilize publics for the purpose of addressing common problems. This construction draws upon the work of such theorists as John Dewey, Jürgen Habermas, James Carey, Benjamin Barber and Michael Schudson, who propose that members of the public come to know and organize themselves through communication platforms and shared social spaces. In the U.S. and elsewhere, broadcast policy and government funding have historically subsidized the creation of protected zones for top-down, gate-kept public media, such as PBS, NPR and cable access channels. The advent of the read/write Web, however, has allowed publics to co-create media for knowledge and action with a wide variety of partners across many different platforms. The paper will present different methods for identifying and visualizing such publics, drawing from research that the Center for Social Media has conducted on documentary films such as The War Tapes, international blogging sites such as Global Voices, and digital broadcast projects such as The Real News (http://www.therealnews.com/web/index.php). By combining case studies, market research, and social network mapping tools, Center for Social Media researchers are working to craft robust accounts of how and why media publics form."

This study analyzed how 2 major online media outlets framed the campaigns of the three most-prominent Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Barack Obama, during the weeks leading up to their declaration and the early weeks of their candidacy. The study relied on content analysis of two major online news sites, cnn.com and washingtonpost.com, to note variations in coverage across time and across varying types of media used in the story. The content analysis data was used to create comparisons between the three candidates with regard to four framing dimensions: time, space, topic, and tone.
Analysis shows significant similarities between coverage of Obama and Clinton with regard to topic, space, and time dimensions but more favorable coverage of Obama with regard to tone. Clintons gender and Obamas race were frequently mentioned in articles across Additionally, mentions of Clinton's gender and Obama's race were highly correlated with reference to the candidates' electability."

As Jack Lindsay observed, no other writer more fully chronicled his City and his Time than Daniel Defoe (c 1660-1731). His countless essays, pamphlets and merchant manuals yield a complex image of a London, full of contradictions. The same 18th century Habermasian coffeehouses which ushered the birth of modern democracy are described by the author also as places of scandal where the brokers, those vermin of trade, gather to conduct their shameful financial schemes. His writings reveal early signs of dialectic tension between forces emphasizing the democratic function of the public sphere, and relentless efforts for its commodification. Furthermore, Defoe himself was described as one of the first propagandists who skillfully used the medium of the emerging free press to manipulate public opinion. To make the picture even more complex, the entire urban structure of London changes right in front of the writers eyes, reflecting new means of transportation, abstraction of values, the rise of consumer society, division of labor within merchant families, as well as a new political balance. This change was again masterfully captured in his writings."

It tested the proposition that deliberation should result in stronger differentiation of beliefs and opinions, less reliance on simple heuristics, and thus lower correlations between opinions about distinct policy approaches. Analyses drew on quasi-experimental data from a nationally representative sample of American citizens, some of whom were randomly selected to participate in online, text-based deliberations. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to examine the latent dimensions underlying multiple opinions and then to test the impact of participation in the online discussions on that latent structure. Results indicate that deliberation produced a significantly more complex and differentiated structure of opinions. Comparisons between elite and non-elite respondents further indicate that this deliberation-induced change can be confidently interpreted as reflecting an increase in cognitive sophistication."

Both groups seemed to have deliberately forgotten that communist ideology still shapes organizational practices in China. This study seeks to examine the Chinese Communist Partys organizational principle, democratic centralism, and its applicability in organizational decision making. First, examining the history of this term, this study attempts to demonstrate how this borrowed principle rhetorically fits into the Chinese culture so well. Then it moves to unpack the dialectics embedded in this principle and explore the applicability and possible consequences in organizational decision making. Finally, it addresses implications for Western organizations in terms of theoretical contributions to organizational decision making scholarship and decision making practices."

Through a form of frame analysis, the overall findings showed that men were more likely to be presented as in control than women. The percentage of women exuding confidence, however, was just as high as it was for the men in the advertisements. No difference was found between the placement of men and women in positions of dominance. In terms of being presented as sexual objects, women were more likely to be presented in a sexually suggestive manner than men. Certain variations in the overall findings did exist depending on whether or not the advertisements appeared in a male-targeted Japanese fashion magazine or a female-targeted Japanese fashion magazine."

However, the voices and contributions of communication scholars have generally been absent in these efforts. Lasting change requires a careful examination of the complex issues embedded (and assumed) in technological contexts. This is particularly relevant as computer science begins to incorporate digital game design and development into its curricula. Game design utilizes the standard elements of computer science (e.g., programming and graphics), and is immediately relevant to students who have grown up playing games and plan to work in the burgeoning game industry. Students bring their expertise to bear in socially relevant contexts such as education, or social and political activism. Educational institutions envision games studies as a means to attract more people into computer science and information technology. This presentation discusses important issues to consider as institutions look to game studies as ways to attract women to computer science and engineering."

These conversations can contribute to the campaigns success rather than being an unintended and irrelevant side-effect. The use of tropes, which leave the intended meaning of the message implicit, may generate discussions on the intended meaning leading to the priming of the beliefs targeted. In South Africa, a highly controversial health mass media campaign employs this strategy to stimulate adolescents to discuss AIDS and lifestyle. A research agenda is proposed that (1) addresses the message design characteristics that are most likely to spark such conversations and (2) addresses the processes that should lead to the campaigns effectiveness."

Furthermore, an individuals chronic motives and cultural values may interact with these factors to impact the success of health message interventions. Although cultures, as well as individuals, vary in their chronic motives, rarely is research on message framing conducted outside of the U.S. The present study examined the potentially interacting effects of cultural value priorities and message framing on compliance with cancer screening messages for a sample of 150 Ukrainians at risk of thyroid cancer. The results indicate that individuals in the gain-framed, but not in the loss-framed, condition showed enhanced intent to get tested when they valued security and higher perceived self-efficacy when they valued stimulation. On the other hand, individuals in the loss-framed condition showed more positive change in self-efficacy when they had low stimulation values."

The present article offers such an analysis, focusing on personal, behavioral and environmental determinants of risk perceptions. Logit log-linear models applied to data gathered in the 2005 Monitoring the Future study of American youth (n = 2,542) revealed the importance of both interpersonal and mass communication in the formation of risk perceptions. Analyses also revealed consistent effects for peer use of steroids, enjoyment of risky behavior, and steroid availability as determinants of perceived risk. Implications and suggestions for future research are offered."

Theoretically, this study attempts to examine the integration of TAM with other perceptions of video sharing sites and consumer characteristics. Practically, the investigation provides video sharing websites with insights into the appeal of their sites to audiences. In addition, this study may help offline video media counter the threats from the drastic growth of video sharing websites. The findings concludes that those males who use the Internet for emotional pleasure and excitement, perceive video sharing websites to have greater usefulness, ease of use, substitutability, and content variety are more frequently using video sharing websites. With respect to service evaluation factors, content variety appears to mitigate the negative effects of content quality, loading speed, screen size, display resolution, and audio quality on video sharing websites."

The Integrated Crisis Mapping (ICM) model is based on a public-based, emotion-driven perspective where different crises are mapped on two continua, the organizations engagement in the crisis and primary publics coping strategy. This second-stage testing, representing the third in the series, found further evidence that anxiety could be the default emotion that publics feel in crises. The subsequent emotions felt by the publics in crises involving hostile takeovers, accidents and natural disasters were variations of sadness, anger and fright, while the subsequent emotions felt by the publics involving in CEO retirement, rumor and psychopathic acts were fright and anger. As far as coping strategies were concerned, conative rather than cognitive coping was evident. Organizations involved in crises pertaining to hostile takeovers, accidents and natural disasters do need to be highly involved while those involved in crises pertaining to CEO retirement, rumor and psychopathic acts need not be highly involved, as posited in the model. The findings, while still very much exploratory, suggest theoretical rigor in the model, with room for further refinements to generate what Yin (2003) termed analytic generalization (p. 33) for the ICM model."

The results supported convergent validity of the scale: POGU showed significant correlations with loneliness and satisfaction with daily life. The results also supported the discriminant validity: The POGU scale did not redundantly measure any of individual difference constructs and was statistically distinguishable from the closely correlated constructs."

Inspired by earlier theories and research on game and internet addiction, we created 21 items to measure seven criteria for game addiction (i.e., salience, tolerance, mood modification, relapse, withdrawal, conflict, and problems). The dimensionality, reliability, and validity of these items and criteria were investigated in a survey among 644 Dutch adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to test different first- and second-order factor models that varied in item length (21 vs. 14 vs. 7 items). Although both 21-item and 14-item second-order factor models resulted in acceptable model fits, the most parsimonious 7-item model clearly provided the best fit. Convergent and criterion-related validity tests provided further evidence of a solid theory-based instrument to measure game addiction."

Data from four studies of recovering alcoholics (N>300) and two studies of nonalcoholics (N= 256 & N=130) supported the EQL12, a theoretically derived twelve item measure, and the EQL16, a sixteen item measure, each with four first-order factors assessing Happiness/Contentment, Depression/Sadness, Anxiety/Fear, and Anger/Hostility which can also be combined to form a second-order factor structure. Confirmatory Factor Analyses supported the superiority of this factor structure to other proposed models. The EQL scales showed good convergent validity with the Satisfaction with Life Scale, Zungs Depression scale, Zungs Anxiety scale, and Navacos Anger inventory. Predictive validity was also indicated by the ability of the EQL and its dimensions to discriminate between alcoholics and nonalcoholics, and between people with diagnosis for psychological and emotional illness, as well as hypothesized relationships to several of measures of emotional expression."

Method: The research was carried out in three sequential phases, with the first two phases devoted to scale development and the third phase to scale validation. Surveys were administrated to a total of 686 participants. Exploratory factor analyses were employed to assess emergent scales and subscales to develop a reliable instrument.
Findings: Based on validated scenarios of cultural competence or incompetence in health care interactions in the first phase along with a survey questionnaire, the second phase resulted in the development of a three-factor scale to measure perceptions of physicians cultural competence. Based on the public perception scale in the second phase along with previously validated measures of relevant constructs (i.e., ethnocentrism, fear of physicians), a five-factor scale emerged as a measure for physicians cultural competence for patient satisfaction in the third phase.
Conclusions: This paper contributed to developing measures for patients perception of physicians cultural competence in health care interactions and to refining extant measures of patient satisfaction."
2008-0353,Development of Hedonic and Eudaimonic Measures of Entertainment Motivations: The Role of Affective and Cognitive Gratifications,"High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Motivation, Emotion, Mood & Affect",,,,Extended Abstract,Development of Hedonic and Eudaimonic Measures of Entertainment Motivations: The Role of Affective and Cognitive Gratifications,"High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Motivation, Emotion, Mood & Affect","Research on the enjoyment of and gratifications associated with entertainment has tended to focus greater attention on positive affective gratifications than on responses that are more aptly described in terms of cognitive gratifications. Although the focus on positive affective responses to media entertainment is understandable, this focus has also resulted in theorists puzzling as to the popularity of genres such as sad film, mournful love songs, or tragic dramas. Drawing from research on psychological and subjective well-being, the present research attempts to address the seeming paradox of individuals entertainment preferences by suggesting that individuals may be motivated to view entertainment not only for purposes of pleasure-seeking (as studied in extant research), but also for purposes of truth seeking. Namely, we suggest that hedonistic motivations are most akin to using media entertainment for purposes of experiencing positive affect. In contrast, we use the term eudaimonic motivations to refer to media uses associated with greater contemplativeness, reflectiveness, insight, or poignancy. We further suggest that eudaimonic motivations are more heavily associated with cognitive gratifications, and likewise, that eudaimonic motivations may be associated with preferences for content that may elicit negative affect insofar as the entertainment is also associated with greater levels of cognitive activity. This research reports the development of measurements that assess hedonistic and eudaimonic motivations for entertainment selection in the context of film preferences and provides initial evidence of their validity in terms of their association with preferences for movie genres and responses while viewing film."
2008-0354,"De-Westernizing Theory and Practice of New Social Movements: The Indigenous Production of Transnational Media Activism in Oaxaca, Mexico",Theory for Activism and Social Change,,,,Paper,"De-Westernizing Theory and Practice of New Social Movements: The Indigenous Production of Transnational Media Activism in Oaxaca, Mexico",Theory for Activism and Social Change,"Perhaps the most important social-activist phenomenon of the past twenty years is what has come to be called new social movements. Such social movements are deemed to be new in so far as they consist of diasporic affinities built around cultural matters of identity and self-representation more so than geographically placed efforts that are concerned with practical matters of economic disparity and political claims. Because of their perceived focus on matters of representation as a form of social intervention, communications is of central importance for new social movementsparticularly communications forms such as the Internet, which is often seen as the way in which diasporic collectivities cohere and accomplish their work.
However, while claims of the diasporic, transnational scale and scope of many new social movements are documented in a wide variety of research, and granting the case of Zapatismo, less attention has been paid to cases that do not arise from the developed, Western world. Indeed, calls for greater attention to such cases in the study of communications constitute an important corrective to the often implicit ways in which theories of new social movements are themselves produced. The purpose of this paper is to respond to this shortcoming in scholarship on media and new social movements by addressing the case of indigenous activism in Oaxaca, Mexico. The material for this study was collected during extensive, often multiple interviews with members of 17 different indigenous organizations, based in either Oaxaca City or towns elsewhere in the state."

Unfortunately, many farm families fail to take necessary succession planning actions even when information is available. Semi-structured interviews conducted with 20 members of 9 small-farm families in Pennsylvania revealed that dialectical tensions experienced surrounding a farm transfer influence succession planning readiness and action. This report identifies 6 indigenous dialectical tensions that influence succession planning and describes the 5 praxis patterns families use to manage them. Practical applications are outlined for agriculture estate planning professionals and others involved in family inheritance communication services to provide effective assistance to farm families in their succession planning efforts."

This paper reads Wests activism, and in particular, the video for his single, Diamonds (are from Sierra Leone) as an instance of hegemonic instability, offering the surprise of contradiction and irony within the strong discourse of contemporary neoliberalism."

With a whole generation of cross-national comparative research now complete, its time for explorations of more complex comparative frameworks that take into consideration social and digital networks and connections that question the centrality of the nation as analytical category. Limitations in engaging with networks and transnational connections in the context of cross-national research need to be addressed in future research, especially as transnationalism and networks gain significance in cultural and political life. Engaging with innovative ways of conducting research across nations, such as thinking through themes rather than through national frameworks, or thinking through networks (not only in relation to findings but also as a unit of methodological analysis), are ways of broadening our empirical research outlook and its relevance. With reference to two cross-national research projects I have worked on and one currently starting, I will discuss some of the challenges encountered in trying to achieve methodological rigour and doing justice to actors and practices studied in digital times."

In addition, the current study examined whether Caucasian Americans and Asian Americans differed in how strongly social responsibility and individual right were related to organ donation intentions. Results showed that belief on organ donation as social responsibility was a significant predictor of intention to enroll in a donor registry, but that the influence of social responsibility on intention to enroll was stronger for Caucasian Americans than for Asian Americans. On the other hand, keeping organs as individual right was negatively associated with the intention to enroll only among Asian Americans, but not among Caucasian Americans. Regarding intention to engage in family discussion, only social responsibility was a significant positive predictor with no difference between Caucasian Americans and Asian Americans. Interpretation of results and implications for communication campaigns are discussed."

It tested different processes of agenda setting between high and low issue-relevant states using the case of immigration issue in 2006. Media salience in national network TV news and local newspapers were compared with public salience obtained from secondary survey data. As predicted, the issue coverage gap between the two localities increased and decreased in accordance with shifting national media attention over time. The findings showed that the issue coverage gap related to public salience gap between the two areas."
2008-0360,Diffusion of Innovations: Evolution and Influences,Histories of the Field of Communication,,,,Paper,Diffusion of Innovations: Evolution and Influences,Histories of the Field of Communication,"Diffusion of innovation has been one of the more popular theoretical frameworks in communication in terms of application. This paper traces back the origin of this line of thought to Gabriel Tarde, who first addressed the issues of change and adoption of new ideas and concepts by the society. However, it took more than 50 years for Rogers to propose diffusion of innovation framework of today. From a historical perspective, this paper attempts to provide a brief review of the multidisciplinary contribution towards the framework and also tries to look at the evolution of diffusion research from diffusion of innovation perspective. Influences, both theoretical and applied have been discussed and observations regarding the uniqueness of the way this framework evolved have been made."
2008-0361,"Digital Convergence, European Competition Policy, and the Future of Public Service Broadcasting: The UK and German Cases",ternational Convergence Policies,,,,Paper,"Digital Convergence, European Competition Policy, and the Future of Public Service Broadcasting: The UK and German Cases",International Convergence Policies,"This paper examines the debate about the future of public service broadcasting in the UK and Germany. Under the impact of new media technologies and political de-regulation, a 'paradigm shift' has occurred towards a market model of broadcasting regulation. Yet, public-service broadcasting in these countries enjoys a strong legitimacy and an institutional entrenchment underpinned by path dependency of public policy, and in Germany's case a constitutional-legal commitment to public-service broadcasting. In both countries, though more so in the case of the BBC, public broadcasters have met the challenge of the new media by developing a range of new services. Despite coming under the close scrutiny of the European Commission competition authorities, the expansion strategies of the public service broadcasters have so far not been impeded from that quarter, though they have been compelled to define their remits more clearly and make their funding arrangements transparent. The paper argues that the BBC has benefited from special advantages. It is viewed not simply as a public service broadcaster, but both as a key driver of new digital media and also as the UKs national champion in the global media marketplace. To this extent, it has enjoyed a greater licence than have the German public broadcasters to expand the range of its new media activities. Hitherto, German policy makers appear to have been more traditional in their thinking about the nature of the public serrvice remit and more swayed by the commercial communications lobby, though this may change in light of recent developments."

In order to understand SSLs influence, the research analyzes and describes how SSL functions by placing the technology in the historical context of the DJs relationship with analog technology and negotiation with digital technologies. The study also considers the aura of hip-hop music culture and how the hip-hop DJ has used consumption as the starting point for the production of lived experience. Using virtual ethnographic methods 370 replies within SSLs web forums were analyzed. This study suggests that SSL is creating a digital divide amongst hip-hop DJs as the importance of vinyl records is disappearing from the subculture. Although SSL is democratizing DJing, this study also finds that the technology deeply impacts the DJs vocabulary, performance processes, and creative energies."

By adopting the behavioral approach, the present study aims to identify leadership dimensions that are critical in establishing organization-wide public relations leadership. Through a national survey of 171 Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) members, the present study identified the seven distinct leadership behaviors germane to the public relations field (upward influence, coordinating, internal monitoring, networking, representing, providing vision, and acting as a change agent). Two supra dimensions (i.e., relations- and change-focused behaviors) that help to represent the seven leadership behaviors more parsimoniously were also proposed. Overall, the enactment of leadership behaviors was found to be positively associated with the practitioners self-assessment of the value of public relations in their organizations. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed."

Jonathan Burston (Assistant Professor of Information Studies at the University of Western Ontario) investigates the role of the military in media production. David Hesmondalgh (Professor of Media and Music Industries at the University of Leeds) raises the role of affect in symbolic production sites. Vicki Mayer (Associate Professor and Chair of Communication at Tulane University) works with invisible labor communities in the new television economy. Timothy Havens (Associate Professor of Communication at the University of Iowa) pushes us to look at cultural negotiations in standard business practices.

It is based on the assumption that the structural environment of mass media, the professional journalism culture, as well as socio-cultural customs influence the production of content on hazards and disasters. The influence factors hence encompass, among others, laws and rules prescribing and constraining the reporting, journalists professional standards and quality norms, and the ways, in which disasters are perceived and coped with in varying social circumstances. The presentation highlights the most relevant differences in media cultures and their impacts on disaster reporting. The comparative approach focusses on regions, such as Western Europe and the USA, post-Soviet states and Asian countries. It draws on own research in the former two regions and compares it with existing knowledge on the latter. This paper rounds off the panels contributions by concentrating on the contextual level."

Yet this development is occurring simultaneous to the transformation of television itself into something less discrete and bounded. At MIT, Unboxing TV concluded with a meta-discussion of the present and future of television studies, considering how the discipline will adjust to the transformation of its analytical object, how television scholars might imagine their academic organization, publication, and public outreach strategies, and what boundaries might be either broken down or reinforced in light of these scholarly and technological transformations. At ICA, I will recap the events from this previous episode, and preview future installments in the serialized narrative of television studies.

Specifically, this research examines the role of cultural and scientific discourse in genomics. While scientific research is built on a position of neutrality from the object of study, it is impossible to study race without common sense understandings of racial difference infecting the purity of science. Scientific discourse is embedded in cultural assumptions about the nature of race and social order. Theoretically, this paper identifies four discursive frames that characterize race talk in contemporary society, drawing on the work of Bell, Bonilla-Silva, Gilroy, Hall, and Spivak. Through a textual analysis of interviews with participants from the next Human Genome Project and articles from biomedical and science journals, I show how these frames operate in the field of human genomics."

Through a careful analysis of the discourses around the two distinctly separate but highly contentious social-scientific issues of immigration and genetic modification in the country, the paper reveals how race, culture, and identity intersect in the systematic stigmatizing of the Third World as an imagined discursive space of people, places, and practices that are deemed to be underdeveloped, primitive, or inferior. This obsession with the Third World in a country that sees itself as part of the 'First World', the paper argues, is shaped in part by the forces of neocolonialism that dictate dominant conceptions of development."

In this paper, we asked the question of whether the relationships among heavy TV viewing, childhood obesity and poor academic performance are in fact due to a common cause in the family system  namely disengaged parenting. We utilized longitudinal data from wave 1 and wave 2 of the Child Development Supplement (CDS-I; CDS-II), a nationally representative sample of children ages 4-12 in 1997 and 8-18 in 2002 to test a classic latent variable common cause model with overwhelmed parenting at time 1 predicting disengaged parenting at time 1 which in turn predicted heavy television use childhood obesity, and poor academic performance 5 years later. The model fit the data extremely well and indicated that disengaged parenting was indeed the common cause of all three outcomes, even controlling for a host of covariates including family income-to-need ration, education of the household head, child gender, child age, and child race. Thus, we suggest that examining family systems influences on both obesity and television viewing is essential to unpacking the relationship between them and arriving at a more nuanced understanding of these relationships."

Advances in computing have enabled us to engage in more powerful tailoring by facilitating assessment of patient needs and health behaviors; and enabling generation of individualized feedback. Powerful computer algorithms have allowed more sophisticated tailoring based on a number of criteria and have facilitated the creation of individualized messages to the level of text. The value of these advances hinges on the assumption that tailoring increases patient engagement in the health messages, and this, in turn, can make individuals more receptive to persuasion efforts. Despite reported success of computer-tailored health interventions delivered over the Web, the methods by which this is achieved and its effects on health outcomes, is still poorly understood. This is a systematic review of efficacy studies of Internet-based, tailored health interventions. We examined how tailoring has been operationalized and the variables used to tailor information on, and identified aspects of computer tailoring that needs further investigation. Our findings indicate that computer tailoring falls into two major categories: health or risk assessments and computer-tailored content/customized health programs. Our research also indicated that several variables are used to guide tailored content, the most common being health behaviors and stages of change. Our ability to optimize the use of computer-tailoring will depend on the development of clearer guidelines for tailoring for a variety of populations, health foci, health behaviors and situations."

As it is getting harder to control the distribution of the musical representation we see an increased importance of what Andrew Goodwin, prior to the digital challenges, called the ancillary industries  [of] TV, radio, cinema, publishing, advertising, playing live and reviewing  both in their old forms as well as in various incarnations of some of their functionalities on Internet services (e.g. last.fm, MySpace.com, allmusic.com etc.). The abundance of stored music is thus increasingly fuelling a need for processes of meaning-making (i.e. music in context as played and/or represented through filters, links, genres etc.) rather than various forms of market communication are calling attention to stored music. This is a shift from a centrality of distribution to other value-making processes, some of which may be termed dissemination. Extending such considerations, this papers aims at a broader typology within which we may begin to understand such shifts.

Henrik Bodker from Aarhus University, Denmark has published a range of articles, as well as taught graduate courses, on various intersections between music and media."
2008-0373,Do Conversation Analytic studies have practical uses?,Practical Uses of Language and Social Interaction Scholarship,,,,Paper,Do Conversation Analytic studies have practical uses?,Practical Uses of Language and Social Interaction Scholarship,"In what ways can Conversation Analytic studies be useful to people engaged in practical activities? While we (Conversation Analysts) study interactional practices, typically we do not instruct people about when to use those practices. However we do offer analyses of the contexts in which practices are employed, the actual methods for carrying out practices, and the interactional and relational implications of employing them. Furthermore, we often contrast the sequential features, relational implications, and interactional consequences of practices with alternative methods of accomplishing the same goal. Our assumption is that with greater knowledge of the workings of a range of practices for accomplishing a goal, individuals will be in a better position to make more effective choices in the practical realm. In this paper, Pomerantz draws on her research on information seeking and in health communication to illustrate the uses and limitations of Conversation Analytic studies in the practical realm."

A large 2 × 2 × 5 full factorial online experiment revealed that respondents (N = 555) were more likely to take action based on the information sourced from a website than from a blog or a homepage. The effect was mediated by perceived level of gatekeeping and perceived information completeness. A two-way interaction between original and selecting sources was mediated by perceived appropriateness of source placement such that information on a website was perceived as more credible if attributed to a doctor than to a layperson while information on a homepage was perceived as slightly more credible if attributed to a layperson. This interaction differed as a function of message. Practical implications for online health planners, physicians, users and policy makers are discussed."

Managing MSK disorders often requires that patients make unwelcome lifestyle changes. Health care providers are a key source of information for patients with MSK and, therefore, interact closely with them. In this study, in-depth interviews with patients, GPs, and specialist rheumatologists in Australia and Canada were analysed using Leximancer (a text-mining tool). Results indicated an emphasis by doctors on accepting and adjusting to the illness, whereas patients emphasised pain relief and getting back to normal. It is suggested that patients and providers need to find a compromise in order to improve the disorder and to help patients reach the quality of life they really want."

A historical reenactment fictional film and a documentary, both about the same theme, were compared to better understand differences in negative affect (guilt and disgust), interest, learning, and transportation. In addition, the process of transportation was investigated; in particular, how negative affect, interest, and learning predict transportation. Results revealed that condition was a significant positive predictor of negative affect and knowledge, but not a significant predictor of interest and transportation. In terms of predictor variables for transportation, negative affect and interest, not learning, positively influence transportation into the narrative. Future research could compare the role of transportation in historical reenactment films and other hybrid media formats that blend fiction and nonfiction to traditional fictional films and documentaries."

The New Americans is a seven-hour mini-series that aired on PBS March 29-31, 2004. The series traces the lives of immigrants from five countries over three years as they prepare to leave their home countries and make new lives in the United States. This ethnographic case study shows how a coalition of stakeholders used a major television broadcast documentary to produce narrowcast videos tailored to particular audience groups for intended social change outcomes. The paper includes textual analysis of campaign materials that were central sites of negotiation for campaign producers, whose situated social, political and institutional concerns came into play as they imagined audience groups and the potential of the documentary narrative to improve the lives of immigrants. By exploring documentarys dual role in revealing truths and in constructing narratives to capture the imagination of viewers, this analysis contributes to ongoing debates about documentary realism, as particularly salient within social change campaigns."
2008-0378,Documenting Melodrama: Hybridity and Nationalism in Korean Reality TV,Hybrid Film Formats: East Meets West?,,,,Paper,Documenting Melodrama: Hybridity and Nationalism in Korean Reality TV,Hybrid Film Formats: East Meets West?,"Over the past few decades, politico-economic changes and media developments have increased fluidities within seemingly homogeneous cultural groups, thus destabilizing once stable identity constructions. This project explores changing ties between citizenship and national identity, and the role of media in negotiating such identity dynamics. A recent South Korean reality TV program, Now We Are Going to Meet, designed to help overseas Korean adoptees locate lost family members, is noteworthy in this respect. Despite being a reality-based program, it often dramatizes the moments of separation and reunion in a hybrid format of documentary, melodrama, and confessional TV shows. This generic hybridity helps the program convey ideological implications regarding Korean national identity. By examining the visual and narrative in the program, this paper investigates how the program oscillates between the ever-expanding criteria of cultural citizenship and traditionally defined nationhood, which will in turn echo how Korean society is (re)negotiating its national identity."

An Examination on Chinese Modernization Discourse,Chinese Perspectives in Intercultural Communication,"Frequently, the term modernity is used without the need to specify global location, since it is understood that it implies the West or a universal standard. Since modernization has long been considered Western and originally rooted in European Enlightenment, the term modernization has acquired a kind of hegemonic cultural value in the West. As modernization and development are often mutually associated, the terms attached to them are produced within and by a particular context, that of the so-called West, generating a particular discourse about them. As such, many non-Western countries have challenged the normative status of Western modernity and advocated a different view of modernity and a particular path of modernization, characterized by local needs and cultural traits. Yet how has culture become an important role in the notion of modernization? This paper presents a comparative study of how the West understands non-Western modernization in a dichotomous way, including Chinese modernization, and how China asserts their own at the official as well as at the popular/nationalist level."

However, the growing readership of partisan-based political blogs and recent concerns about nasty blogs calls for research attention on how bloggers tone of expressing disagreement influence readers emotional reactions and their attitudes toward political disagreement. Accordingly, this study examines how readers react to uncivil blog commentary, as a function of whether or not they identify as a member of the party that the partisan blogger is critiquing. Results generally support scholars concerns about detrimental effects of incivility especially when the blogger attacked views consistent with the participants position."

Evaluating Cross-National Evidence,,,,Paper,Does Distance Still Matter in Connected Lives? A Pre- and Post-Internet Comparison,Do ICTs Foster Social Connectivity or Social Isolation? Evaluating Cross-National Evidence,"Has the Internet led to the death of distance (Cairncross) in interpersonal relations. I use Connected Lives interview and survey data from Toronto to measure the effect of distance on the frequency of email, face-to-face, and phone contact in personal networks. I further compare the results with pre-Internet data drawn from the same neighborhood in the 1970s. Multi-level models with spline specification examine the non-linear effect of distance on the frequency of contact. The results show that email contact is generally insensitive to distance. Face-to-face contact remains strongly related to short distances (within five miles), while distance has little impact on how often people phone each other within 100 miles. Thus the frequency of face-to-face and phone contact  and their sensitivity to distance  have hardly changed between the 1970s and the 2000s. Yet email additionally connects them with local, regional and distant ties."

Audience Identification With Favorite Sitcom Characters,"Advances in Media Involvement, Identification, and Engagement","This study seeks to explore the nature of identification with media characters in a situation comedy that audience members have not been exposed to. Antecedents and consequences of identification were proposed and examined. The results suggested that identification was predicted by perceived realism and one empathy dimension, fantasy. Perspective-taking, empathic concern, and personal distress did not significantly predict identification. Identification also influenced participants? enjoyment of the show and their emotional responses."
2008-0383,Does Immaterial Labour Work?,Theorizing Labor in the New Cultural Economy,,,,Paper,Does Immaterial Labour Work?,Theorizing Labor in the New Cultural Economy,"The cultural industries are often seen as a key testing zone for theories of creative labour. If creative work in general is precarious, as some would argue it is (because creativity is supposedly dependent, in any industry, on innovation and therefore its results and returns cannot be predicted with certainty) then work in the cultural industries might be particularly prone to high levels of risk and casualisation. However, along with new theories of 'precarity', there is much theoretical talk at the moment of the new capacities of 'immaterial labour' for new forms of solidarity. Such speculations are rarely based on empirical work. This paper reports on empirical work in three different cultural industries: television, recorded music, and magazine journalism. Drawing on interviews and participant observation, it asks: what forms of precarity and solidarity are apparent in these supposedly archetypal 'creative industries'? How is such precarity and solidarity constructed, negotiated and internalised in different industrial, institutional and genre settings?"
2008-0384,Does the Audience Matter? An Empirical Examination of the Hostile Media Effect,Exploring Media Bias,,,,Paper,Does the Audience Matter? An Empirical Examination of the Hostile Media Effect,Exploring Media Bias,"According to the hostile media effect (HME) partisans perceive actually balanced media coverage as biased against their opinion on an issue. The paper deals with the determinants of the HME: An integrative causal model is offered that starts with the assumption that partisans exposure to media-coverage of a conflict increases awareness of their shared identity with their ingroup, i.e. the group that assumingly shares the same opinion in the conflict. Partisans start to be concerned about the status of their ingroup compared to the status of the competing outgroup. Depending on how the audience is perceived, partisans presume a negative influence of the media coverage on the audience in that it seems capable to strengthen the status of the outgroup: If the audience is perceived to be large and socially distant, partisans are thought to presume a negative influence. The presumed negative influence, in turn, results in a biased perception known as the HME. In the light of this model, an experiment with 230 students was conducted. It examined the effect of assumed audience size (large vs. small) on HME while reading a controversial text. As a quasi-experimental factor, subjects were grouped according to their perceived social distance of the audience (distant vs. similar). Subjects assuming a small audience perceived the controversial text to be more in line with their opinion than readers assuming a large audience. Of the applied social-distance dimensions, only education had an effect: the less educated the audience was perceived to be, the stronger the HME."

The appeal of this ragtag law enforcer can be attributed to the mythology that surrounds him. Dog is not just a bounty hunter. He is an ex-convict-turned-bounty hunter. Not only is he an ex-con-turned-bounty-hunter, he is an ex-con-turned-bounty-hunter-turned born-again Christian. The mythology of Dog is, of course, the redemption story  the prodigal son returned home to serve his father after going so terribly astray. This paper will examine the extent of the use of the redemption story within reality programming using Dog as the main case study. The paper will use content analysis to show how each episode of the show is a mini-redemption story (the fugitive returning home to the Father) with Dog as the catalyst who leads the lost back to the fold.

In her description of Communication Privacy Management theory, Petronio (2002) argued that privacy management is a rule-based system centered around maximizing control over information while minimizing risks associated with disclosing private information. Face Theory was used as an analysis tool to examine these risks. An inductive analysis was completed from interviews with persons who had revealed information about a serious relational problem to family. When talking with family about their serious romantic relationship problems, the management of this private information was impacted by ones own positive and negative face, their partners positive and negative face, their family members negative face, and their romantic relationships negative face. How Face Theory informs the participants process of information management is also discussed."

The present study tried to expose underlying social cognitive factors for donation to relief campaigns. A causal model was constructed, based on social cognitive theory and research on attitudes and the impact of media exposure. The aim was to expand and improve an already existing model of Cheung and Chan (2000). The expanded model showed a better fit. Furthermore, the expanded model explained two-third of the variance of the intention to donate to a disaster relief campaign. The strongest predictor of the intention to donate proved to be ?Past donation to disaster relief campaigns?. The factor ?News exposure? was indicated to be a valuable additional factor as it had a significant direct effect on ?Awareness of a disaster relief campaign? and was the only factor which had a total effect on all other factors, including ?Intention to donate to a disaster relief campaign?."

Communication scholars point out citizens learning from news media is not effective due to a selective preference for particular types of news media. Recently, some scholars suggest democratic education through soft news or political entertainment could be effective. However, other scholars are concerned that entertainment-types of media are harmful for the democratic process. This meta-analytic study examines detailed political knowledge items related to the learning capability of entertainment program (e.g., the late-night comedy show) based on the IRT (i.e. Item Response Theory). Using 43 political knowledge itemseight items are dropped after examinationmeasured in 2004 presidential election, we find late-night comedy may increase political knowledge (Baums hypothesis), but its learning effect is limited to easy or moderately difficult items. The theoretical implications of entertainment programs for democracy and practical suggestions for studies of entertainment media effects are discussed based on the findings."

Self-Affirmation Promotes Online Type 2 Diabetes Risk Test Taking,Overcoming Barriers to Effective Health Communication,"Health promotion campaigns targeting type 2 diabetes inform people about the seriousness and life-threatening complications of diabetes. Recent campaigns stress the importance of assessing ones personal risk for this disease by taking an online risk test. However, people at-risk (i.e., the target audience) often respond defensively to health information (Kunda, 1987) and are most reluctant to undertake screening behaviors (Fako, 2006). Recently, self-affirmation has been found to decrease defensive responses to health information (Harris & Napper, 2005). Self-affirmation involves the opportunity to affirm an important personal value. In this study, we manipulated self-affirmation, and measured participants risk level prior to reading threatening type 2 diabetes information. As predicted, self-affirmation decreased message derogation, increased intentions to do an online type 2 diabetes risk test, and promoted actual risk test taking behavior among participants at-risk. Self-affirmation sorted unfavorable effects among participants not at-risk."

An Examination Across Elections and Issues,Media Effects on Elections,"A large body of literature has documented the origins of media bias but research has lagged behind in understanding the consequences of bias perceptions. Our research fills in this gap by examining the influence of bias perception on individuals levels of general and issue-specific political participation in a sequence of three analyses. Using survey data collected in XXXXX, Analysis 1 demonstrates that perceptions of media bias were positively correlated with general participation at the zero-order level. However, this significant relationship was fully mediated by political efficacy in the final regression model, suggesting an indirect relationship between media bias and participation. Using structural equation modeling, Analysis 2 shows that perception of media bias has an indirect effect on political participation, mediated by trust and political efficacy. Specifically, media bias indirectly undermines engagement in the political process. Using survey data collected in the state of XXXXXX, Analysis 3 shows that perception of media bias has a direct positive influence on issue-specific participation, contrary to the relationship found in general political participation. Implications for political participation and media bias theories are discussed."

Exploring Sadness-Based Media Choice and Its Anticipated Effects on Coping","Emotion, Mood, and Media",,,,Paper,"Do We Improve, Disrupt, or Embrace Sadness? Exploring Sadness-Based Media Choice and Its Anticipated Effects on Coping","Emotion, Mood, and Media","Sadness, unlike other negative feelings, is unique in that its main causes are related to unpreventable and irreversible harm without any blamable objects. Due to these characteristics, previous theories of media use that center around enjoyment-focused use are not sufficient to explain sad viewers media use that is often inconsistent with hedonism-driven selection. To predict sadness-based media preference that corresponds to the three perceived salient goals of sadness regulationimproving, distracting, or embracingthe present study conducted an experiment (N = 100) manipulating sad and neutral feelings using music and autobiographic memory and repeatedly measuring preference for three media genressad drama, comedy and game shows. Results showed that most participants in both sad and neutral conditions preferred to watch comedies; however, some participants in the sad condition chose sad dramas, expecting that they would re-evaluate their difficulties, integrate them as a part of life, and finally gain insights into life and the world. The findings are further discussed in terms of the importance of these cognitive responses distinct from emotional responses that resulted from the use of media."
2008-0392,Doxa and Paradox About Communication,Transvaluing Media and Communication Research,,,,Paper,Doxa and Paradox About Communication,Transvaluing Media and Communication Research,"Scholars have described communication as important or mundane, age-old or recent, universal or particular, dynamic or static, autocratic or democratic, techné ¯r art. Yet, in recent years the interrogation of diverse and sometimes divergent meanings of communication has declined, numerous theorists and researchers seeming to accept the manufacturing of consent on communication issues and problematics. Definitions and descriptions of communication constitute the doxa of the field by which it creates and reproduces itself. In this essay, we propose a new systematization of understandings of communication, by examining relevant sources and offering concrete examples. We outline scholarly discourses about and paradoxes of communication, distinguishing between different types of definitions and trends. We assert that communication scholars should produce new accountings of the concept of communication, that examine type of worldview and of orientation, and that discuss positive and negative aspects of each approach."

In light of questions concerning media credibility, this study investigates how evaluations of news stories are affected by evaluations of adjacent messages. We draw on theoretical perspectives used in social judgment research to conceptualize credibility judgments as susceptible to context effects. Using a 2x2 between-subjects experimental design, we test whether credibility ratings of a balanced news story are affected by the ideological position and tone of an adjacent opinionated message. Our findings demonstrate that a news story is perceived as more credible when situated adjacent to opinion commentary that provides an extreme standard of comparison, a contrast effect."

While education, science, and culture can be found in UNESCOs acronym, it is the media of mass communication that found its way in the first article of the organizations constitution as a primary front against ignorance, deemed by the organization to be a central factor in wars between nations. This resulted in the formation of the Mass Communication Office in 1947 along with a number of initiatives incorporating a variety of theoretical approaches familiar to communication studies. Similar sentiments about the relationship between communication and peaceful coexistence were also expressed at New Yorks Jewish Theological Seminary at around the same time. In the shadow of the Holocaust, the JTS undertook an aggressive educational program aimed at improving inter-faith dialogue. One of the earliest initiatives undertaken by the JTS was a series of lectures which would later be published in The Communication of Ideas edited by Lyman Bryson. Drawing on archival research performed at both institutions this paper re-traces how problems of communication appeared within institutions dealing in different ways with postwar reconstruction."

Entrenched divisions between administrative and critical tendencies are played out within schools and emerging disciplines and across a range of scientific/humanist, quantitative/qualitative and political/cultural paradigms. Of course, this is only the beginning of the mischief for there are many other polarities at play and a host of variations within polar contrasts. (Dervin, Shields and Song 2005) This paper argues that the play of contending schools with little purchase on each other, or anything much, has turned meta-discourse about communication into an ontological maelstrom. Perhaps the only way to ride out this storm is to look towards particular communication practices that draw together disparate elements to see how their particular theoretical underpinnings may offer safe moorings while the worst of the storm passes by. The jam session seems a useful place to start. From its roots in jazz and blues to its contemporary manifestations in rap and hip-hop and throughout the communication industries, the improvised reorganisation of traditional themes into new and striking patterns confronts the ontological possibilities in music, and life, by taking the flotsam flung up by the storm to piece together the means to transcend the downward pull into the abyss."
2008-0397,Ecological Dynamics of Online Communities,The Emergence and Growth of Online Communities in Theory and Practice,,,,Paper,Ecological Dynamics of Online Communities,The Emergence and Growth of Online Communities in Theory and Practice,"The rise and fall of online communities have attracted substantial attention from academia as well as industry. Online communities experience tumult in relation to changes in technologies, member attention and preferences, ownership, competition for resources and imitation by new entrants. This paper develops an evolutionary framework for studying such changes. A population of online communities occupy the same niche, defined by common interest or subject area, and share the same resources: content-generating capacity of participants and attention of viewers. Based on density-dependence and niche theories, we propose that founding rate of online communities will increase when population density is low, because of legitimation processes. Founding rate will reach a ceiling and then decline later when density is high, because of competition pressure from online communities that occupy the same niche area.
We also examine the different population dynamics over their lifecycles of specialist versus generalist online communities."
2008-0398,Educational Public Service TV in Canada: From the mainstream to the alternative margins,"Alternative Media: Policy, Politics, and Practice",,,,Paper,Educational Public Service TV in Canada: From the mainstream to the alternative margins,"Alternative Media: Policy, Politics, and Practice","Educational public service broadcasting has been under challenge by provincial New Right policies since the early 1990s. The privatization of Access Alberta in 1994 and the struggle of other educational broadcasters against politicization are also of concern in this environment.

This paper will argue that the often overlooked educational broadcasting sector has been decentred from its quiet provincial niche as serving the public interest and, like the CBC itself, as playing a hegemonic role within Canadian society, and is now marginalized within the alternative media environment. As the reputation and space for public interest broadcasting diminishes, it remains vulnerable as it continually scrambles for resources and renegotiates its mandate. Moreover, within the alternative media environment, educational broadcasting, with its non-radical, non-controversial content, has little profile or recognition as playing a role in challenging the mainstream world of private for-profit broadcasting and is thus doubly marginalized. The paper also suggests that the fate of Canadian educational public service broadcasting may be linked both to the future of the CBC and its relationship with alternative media."

As Native populations in North America age, questions emerge about how we can enhance the health and wellbeing of Native elders in a culture that is predominately non-native. With most research on health and aging focused on the mainstream of society, how are scholars studying health to know the specialized needs of Native Americans, First Nations Peoples, Alaskan Natives, and Hawaiian Islanders? This paper reviews the themes regarding communication and culture, aging, and health in Native American, First Nations Peoples, Alaskan Natives, and Hawaiian Islanders in health research in the scientific and social scientific disciplines. This analysis brings to light a cultural perspective on communication, aging, and health that has otherwise been overlooked."

Attribute Framing and HPV Vaccine Efficacy,High Density: Message Design Research,"Studies that have examined HPV vaccine acceptance indicate that perceived vaccine effectiveness is a fundamental vaccine attribute. Using a survey-embedded 1 x 5 between subjects design, this study experimentally tests whether attribute frames that appear in the mass media and present equivalent effectiveness information (e.g., 70% effective vs. 30% ineffective) result in different ratings for HPV vaccine effectiveness and more distal vaccine-related variables. Vaccine effectiveness ratings differed by condition F(4, 323)=5.91, p<.001. As hypothesized, positive attribute frames resulted in more favorable vaccine ratings than negative attribute frames, t(162) = 4.18, p<001. Likelihood of vaccine recommendation did not show a significant effect by experimental condition, but likelihood of voting for a hypothetical candidate who proposed vaccine mandates did. Path analysis shows perceived vaccine effectiveness as a mediator between positive attribute framing and higher average likelihood of voting for the candidate. Implications of findings for HPV vaccination research, health communication are discussed."

To date, about 6.5 million people have entered Second Life, and the impact of this technology is beginning to be felt by society. Second Life is not merely an entertainment platform for gaming and social networking. In fact, e-commerce already thrives in this virtual world. Avatar-based 3D virtual environments are a promising corporate communication channel for brand marketing in the sense that companies can invest in the design and creation of spokes-avatars that can represent their brand and product. This study aims to examine the effects of different characteristics manifested by a companys spokes-avatar. Two series of between-subject design experiments were conducted. First, the foci of the 2 (type of spokes-avatar) X 2 (gender matching) between-subjects experiment are on (1) the effects of the appearance (human avatar VS non-human avatar) and (2) the effects of matching between the gender of the spokes-avatar which represents Apple Company and presents product (iPhone) information to the consumer and the gender of the consumer in Second Life (matched gender VS mismatched gender). The second experiment examined the effects of message modality (textual modality VS audio/video modality) of the spokes-avatar. The actual iPhone product information was expanded beyond a text-only modality to include video and audio focusing on the effect of additional avatar capabilities. The results will be discussed with regard to the implications of avatar-based 3D virtual environment for advertising and marketing communication."

It is argued that discrete emotions such as anger and fear have differential effects on perceived susceptibility to the health problem described in a health message and perceived efficacy of the prescribed health behavior, which in turn influence persuasion outcomes. In an experiment, angry participants reported less perceived susceptibility than fearful participants. Fearful participants reported lower perceived response efficacy than angry participants, although only when the health message was loss-framed. Mediation analyses suggest that the effect of discrete emotion (anger vs. fear) on attitude toward the health behavior was mediated by perceived susceptibility and response efficacy."

Prior research has documented the positive effects of support from friends, but has neglected the potential strain that may occur in friendships. The goal of this paper is to explore the effects of friends support and friend strain on positive and negative affect, as well as psychological well-being throughout the life span. The results reported come from the National Survey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS). Results supported a positive relationship between friend support and positive affect and psychological well-being. Results also indicated differences in older male friendships. The discussion highlights implications for both research on friend support and strain in older adult relationships and future work on how friendships positively affect older adults."

This study surveyed 929 college students to examine their episodic heavy-drinking beliefs, attitudes and behaviors with a combination of theoretical perspectives. Specifically, this project intends to: (1) assess episodic high-risk drinking behavior, (2) explain drinking behavior by adapting the concepts of social cognitive theory and theory of reasoned action, and (3) introduce and test the validity of the controlled-drinking efficacy concept. The primary objective of this study is to theorize about the cognitive, affective and behavioral pattern of students high-risk drinking behavior for the purposes of advancing additional theoretical efforts and empirical understanding of this social phenomenon. Major findings indicate that the theoretical model was able to explain 44% of the total variance in high-risk drinking frequency, with all major theoretical components providing statistically significant contributions to the model."

However, despite the growing popularity of online educational games, empirical studies about the effects of the networked interactivity are relatively rare. This study tests the effects of networked interactivity on game users subjective evaluation of learning (sense of competition, satisfaction, and perceived efficiency) and objective test performance in an online educational game. In addition, since the games facilitate virtual social interactions, this study investigates the mediating effect of feelings of social presence between networked interactivity and the evaluation of learning in the game. Results show that networked interactivity enhances positive evaluation of learning, test performance, and social presence. Furthermore, social presence strongly mediates the effect of networked interactivity on the evaluation of learning."

However, few studies have investigated possible gender differences in alcohol use disorder using larger structural model. The present study hypothesized structural model to examine the effects of psychological problems, associating with communication competence and relational maintenance, on alcohol use disorder and to investigate how these effects are influenced by the differences in the structural relationships of males and females. The data with the sample of 782 South Korean adequately fit to the hypothesized model. Through the results, we discovered that communication competence and relational maintenance as well as psychosocial problems are important factors to treat alcohol use disorder. In addition we found that different approaches in alcohol use disorder for males and females are necessary."

A 2 (geographical proximity/distance) × [2 (rapist/victim photograph) × 2 (positive/negative frame)] design is employed to examine the treatment effects on participants risk perceptions in responses to mock online news stories about a paroling serial rapist.
Results reveal that pictures inserted in sexual crime news of the victim/woman might cause greater differences between high-rationality and low-rationality participants in response to the discrete emotion of disgust, unease, and apprehension. And among low-rationality participants, there are significant differences of elicited negative emotion of disgust between pictures with positively framed rapist and pictures with woman/victim. It seems that low-rationality participants tend to peripherally process pictures of sexual crime news. However, the proposed effects between rationality and the news value of proximity are not supported by the results."

The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence for the utility of the role-enactment perspective to understand a new relationship of human-computer interaction in a new context of computer-mediated communication. The results of Experiment 1 (n = 56) showed that the participants who played the male role maintained greater physical distance between themselves and the computer agent than the participants who played the female role, regardless of their biological sex. Experiment 2 (n = 84) was conducted to retest the findings of Experiment 1 with larger samples, as well as to examine the effects of different points of view (i.e., first-person view vs. third-person view) on gender-role salience, gender self-concept, and physical distance management in interactive media. Not only did the results confirm all the findings of Experiment 1, but also suggest that altering contextual features of interactive media could magnify behaviors in the way that conforms to the salient role identity. Theoretical implications as well as practical strategies for the design of interfaces for interactive media (e.g., virtual reality systems and videogames) are discussed."

Only a handful of published eHealth studies have included a sample of ethnic minority or rural participants with chronic illnesses. There is a need for research that identifies the most effective methods for recruiting and retaining rural and ethnic minority populations in eHealth interventions. Such information is critical to the advancement of the field and for the success of initiatives that seek to reduce disparities in health care services.
This paper identifies factors that have contributed to low recruitment of rural and ethnic minority populations in e-Health outcome research, followed by a discussion of methods for increasing recruitment, engagement, and retention. Finally, future directions for eHealth intervention research with rural and ethnic minority populations are addressed."

But with the continuous increasing complexity of health information, even those with adequate health literacy can appreciate simpler health communication. This project investigated the potential for two specially-tailored e-health interventions, designed to provide information to low health literate audiences, to deliver information to broader and more health literate audiences. These websites provided information through animated health providers, with supporting images and animations. Subjects approved of both websites designs, preferring the newer and more graphically appealing of the two. Respondents learned from both interventions, as measured by pre- and post-tests of knowledge. Participants did not exhibit significant preferences for animated health providers matching their own ethnicity, suggesting the importance of true cultural customization of content. Study results provide interesting implications for both health communication professionals and researchers."

Specifically, I seek to demonstrate that visible activities may function as part of the interactive structure of an ""argument""; that, embodied actions can be forms of arguments. To support this claim, the paper analyzes naturally occurring interaction between plastic surgeons and patients seeking to alter their bodily landscape. Using AIDA (Tracy, 2005) and microethnography (Streeck & Mehus, 2005) as methodological-theoretical lenses, the essay challenges the assumption that making an argument solely is a discursive activity."
2008-0415,Embodiment of Gender and Different Politics: Hillary Rodham Clinton Self-Representation and Iowa Medias Responses,Politics & Gender in the Age of Interactive Mass Media,,,,Paper,Embodiment of Gender and Different Politics: Hillary Rodham Clinton Self-Representation and Iowa Medias Responses,Politics & Gender in the Age of Interactive Mass Media,"As a presidential contender in a predominately masculine political public sphere, Hillary Rodham Clinton walks the line between American social construction of a female and of previous national wartime leadership. One issue is whether she embodies the interests of her gender (Rakow & Wackwitz 2004, 180). Another is whether she engages in politics differently, thereby improving the nature of the public sphere (Squire 1999, 205). The focus here is whether this major 2008 presidential candidate and the media who cover her emphasize gender and a dissimilar political engagement. If so, how?

This qualitative research paper seeks symbiosis and differences between the Clinton November 2007 campaign messages and major Iowa online media as to political distinctions and gender embodiment. With comparative framing patterns, the research examines Clintons self representations compared to the Iowa media coverage that might highlight differences and identify, emphasize, ignore, or neuter her gender. Taken from the Des Moines Register and Channel 13 (NBC) news links via www.iowavotes2008.com, the major expectation is that media will emphasize gender while HRCs office will stress candidacy differences."
2008-0416,Embracing Actionable Uncertainty: Communication in Well-Led Organizations,Theory and Research in Organizational Leadership Studies,,,,Paper,Embracing Actionable Uncertainty: Communication in Well-Led Organizations,Theory and Research in Organizational Leadership Studies,"People who embrace actionable uncertainty recognize that meaningful learning, innovation, and progress can only be achieved when they take action in concert with their doubts and misgivings. Prior research established that employees prefer to work in organizations that embrace actionable uncertainty. Yet the research has little to say about the relationships between uncertainty management practices, leadership and communication. This research project focused on the relationship between these concepts. In particular, this study compared employee perceptions of communication practices in well-led organizations to those in not well-led organizations. Employees from a wide-range of organizations completed a survey composed of communication items and scales from the Uncertainty Management Matrix. The study revealed that: 1) well-led organizations cultivate more uncertainty-embracing climates than their counterparts, 2) effective leaders encourage employees to notice changing trends, new ideas, and situational nuances, 3) effective leaders stimulate discussion, debate, and dialogue, and 4) effective leaders clearly and succinctly articulate goals or the end state."
2008-0417,Emerging Computer Skills: Influences of Young Childrens Executive Functioning Abilities and Parental Scaffolding Techniques,Child and Adolescent Development in the Context of New Media Technologies,,,,Paper,Emerging Computer Skills: Influences of Young Childrens Executive Functioning Abilities and Parental Scaffolding Techniques,Child and Adolescent Development in the Context of New Media Technologies,"The purpose of this study was to examine how four-year-old children learn to use computers and what cognitive factors and parental scaffolding practices are associated with control of the computer via the mouse interface. Fifty-three 4-year-old children were videotaped while viewing two online storybooks. Results indicated that children who had better executive functioning abilities were more likely to control the mouse. When the child primarily controlled the mouse, parent verbalizations were typically related to computer mechanics about how to use the mouse. By contrast, when the parent primarily controlled the mouse, parent verbalizations were focused on storyrelevant questions. Regardless of whether the child or parent controlled the mouse, story comprehension was comparable. The results suggest that executive functioning ability is important in young childrens development of computer skills and that parents adapt their verbalizations to match the abilities of their children and the tasks that their offspring are doing."
2008-0418,Emerging Media in Peril: Iraqi Journalism in the Post-Saddam Hussein Era,Media Beyond the Middle East,,,,Paper,Emerging Media in Peril: Iraqi Journalism in the Post-Saddam Hussein Era,Media Beyond the Middle East,"After the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in April 2003, the Iraqi media have witnessed a remarkable growth in number and diversity. From the Western journalistic perspective, the invasion is often viewed as a form of liberation in terms of press freedom. Over the four years after the collapse of the Saddam regime, there emerged new threats and restraints to ensnare the Iraqi media in various forms of legal, political, religious, and physical dangers against journalists. Based on in-depth interviews with 22 Iraqi journalists working in the country, this study found that various legal and regulatory restraints imposed by the new Iraqi government, political pressures from religious groups, and security-related threats such as murders and abductions by terrorists and militias all work against Iraqi journalists and their yearnings for press freedom. Based upon the classic Four Theories of the Press, and William Hachtens classification of global press systems, this study concludes that Iraqi media system is heading toward an Authoritarian press system model, instead of a free Libertarian press system. The experience of the Iraqi media and journalists parallels that of media and journalists in the former communist bloc of Eastern Europe where former Marxist-Leninist press systems have transformed into Authoritarian press systems in less than two decades."
2008-0419,Emotional Expressivity and Social Support Among Adult Daughters of Alcoholic Mothers,Conversations in Families,,,,Paper,Emotional Expressivity and Social Support Among Adult Daughters of Alcoholic Mothers,Conversations in Families,"The current study examined associations between emotional expressivity (happiness, sadness, fear, & anger) and provision of social support among adult daughters of alcoholic mothers. Participants (N = 299) completed a retrospective measure of maternal alcoholism and current measures of emotional expressivity (happiness, anger, sadness, & fear) and five of the six provisions of social support identified by Weiss (1974). Correlational analyses show support for the hypothesized negative associations between maternal alcoholism and emotional expressivity and positive associations between expressions of happiness and support availability (guidance, reliable alliance, social integration, attachment, & reassurance of self-worth). Results of the analyses employed to answer the research question about the associations between negative emotional expressivity (fear, anger, & sadness) and provisions of support appear to suggest that while expressions of sadness likely function to solicit certain types of support (guidance, reassurance of self-worth, & attachment), fear and anger expressions inhibit provision of support through social contagion. More specifically, fear expressions were associated with perceptions of decreased support across all five provisions. Results are discussed in the context of the literature reviewed and the study concludes with a summary of the limitations of the study and some directions for future research."

ABSTRACT
Research indicates that the extent to which one becomes engaged, transported, or immersed in a narrative experience influences the narratives potential impact on subsequent story related attitudes and beliefs. However, researchers ability to distinguish among different cognitive and emotional manifestations of narrative engagement is limited. Scales used to assess involvement in narrative experiences either do not capture affective sensations (e.g., telepresence scale) or combine items measuring affective and cognitive sensations into a single scale (e.g., transportation scale).
This study introduces and empirically evaluates a four dimension scale that can be used to measure emotional engagement, narrative understanding, attentional focus, and a sense of being there as experience while viewing a filmic narrative.
Results of factor analyses appropriate for scale development are presented. Full and short versions of the scale, as well as subscales are compared to Green and Brocks (2000) transportation scale. And, analyses demonstrating the scale and subscales abilities to predict realism, enjoyment, and story consistent attitudes and beliefs are presented."

However, there is a general lack of solid empirical approaches to experience-based products and services. In this paper we present initial results of the role of emotion and mood in the experience of tourists using advanced mobile technologies to facilitate and capture their experiences in mobile contexts. We conducted a study with 15 tourists using advanced mobile media in Philadelphia. A time interval structured experience sampling method (ESM) questionnaire was used to assess the experience of the subjects while on the move. Also, pre- and posttrip questionnaires were administered, including questions about mobile phone use. Initial results show that subjects experienced relatively high levels of joy and pleasant relaxation during their trip. Results for the mobile phone use suggest a relative lack and low importance of MMS-communication in the form of picture sharing."

(both smokers and non-smokers) reactions towards an organizational non-smoking policy which aimed to create a smoke-free workforce (i.e., firing smokers or keeping and hiring non-smokers only). Compared to smoke-free workplace policies (i.e., restricting employees to smoke only in a designated area or prohibiting smoking on the organization?s premises), smoke-free workforce policies have higher severity for noncompliance, therefore, are expected to have deeper impact on the employees? attitudes, perceptions and behaviors. The present study used in-depth interviews (n = 20) to explore the issue from the perspective of those employees who experienced the process of implementing the smoke-free workforce policy. Three coders independently coded all the interviews, and several themes emerged; for example, resistance to change, concern of implications of the policy, and lack of internal buy-in of the policy. It is worth to note that although non-smoking policies have direct and immediate impact on smokers, non-smoking employees also expressed their concerns for the implications of the policy. Other findings, implications for organizational practice, and directions for future research are also discussed."

In 2006, the rock star championed the (RED) campaign, whose mission is rallying western consumers to use their purchasing power to support retailers that donate product proceeds to African aid organizations. Through the appropriation of style, the (RED) campaign branded activist identity in order to sell products and enhance the philanthropist image of corporations that participated in the campaign. This paper critically examines the (RED) campaign as a media phenomenon that ultimately supports existing power structures by promoting capitalism and consumerism as effortless and effective forms of activism. Bono and the (RED) campaign serve as exemplars through which to examine the proliferation, effectiveness, and consequences of commodity activism and the challenges it poses for critical scholarship."

The Boondocks has faced repeated accusations of political propagandizing and has also been repeatedly labeled racist by many of its detractors for its provocative depiction of black popular and political culture. Though largely driven by the economic logics of contemporary media industries, brands like The Boondocks also serve important cultural and political roles in providing outlets for social criticism and community engagement. In this paper, I analyze how the community that has formed around The Boondocks uses the popular entertainment brand to engage in political conversations and articulate a differentiated black cultural citizenship. I argue that the community invests in politics differently than traditionally imagined informed citizens, privileging identity over
partisanship and emphasizing the importance of value-laden, commonsense political actions and language that speaks directly to black American concerns. The Boondocks community tries to resolve particular tensions activated by the brand over the current state of black American cultural citizenship. In so doing, the community often resorts to populist and exclusionary tactics that overemphasize personal responsibility in the face of continued structural inequality in the post civil rights era.

Where do news websites in China stand in terms of Web feature usage? Through a comparative feature analysis of 30 news websites at the provincial level and one at the central level in China, this study found that they had not taken full advantage of the available Web features to engage or empower news audiences online. In their actual usage of Web features, news websites used more engaging than empowering features. Usage of engaging features, however, was limited in scale and scope. What is worth noting is that some news websites did allow their audiences to contribute stories online, to comment on stories and/or to correct errors in stories. Although these empowering features were used in a small scale, they did show the initiatives of news websites in China to try their hands on audience-centric-and-participatory journalism as an alternative practice in the context of government-controlled mainstream media"

In an effort to transcend the ""gendered nature"" of both television and morality all television genres are taken into account and a wider conception of morality than the traditional one, which is situated in rationality, is adopted. A framework derived from the literary culture is employed to research the ways in which viewers appropriate insights into moral issues, moral deliberation and the human character offered by television narratives to engage their own moral imagination. Forty-one in-depth interviews are analysed using a grounded-theory approach. Three modes of moral reflection emerged during the analysis: interpretative, additional and associated reflection. These modes of reflection are illustrated with the moral issues mostly reflected upon by the interviewees: civil conduct, violence, and love. Results indicate not only that people do appropriate television narratives of all genres to engage the moral imagination, but also that transcending the gendered conceptions of both television and morality delivers us with more insight into the complex relationship between both."

This paper reports the results of longitudinal research testing ADT?s ability to predict viewer responses to daytime soap opera. A student sample completed a survey asking them to evaluate characters over 10 successive weeks. Measures of character morality and positive/negative outcomes for behaviors were used to predict both the results of independent, representative viewer enjoyment surveys, and official Nielsen ratings covering the same 10 weeks. Consistent with ADT logic, the interaction of character morality and behavior outcomes predicted higher Nielsen ratings and increased viewer enjoyment when benefaction/debasement befell characters morally deserving of these outcomes. Though well supported in short-term studies, to our knowledge this is the first study to support ADT over extended exposure to soap opera and by predicting results in independent data sources."

In an online questionnaire, 161 viewers described a sequence in which a liked, neutral or disliked character was threatened and then rated their reactions on a series of scales. Results were consistent with Zillmanns model of suspense enjoyment and affective disposition theory. When there was no harm done to the character, enjoyment of the episode was positively predicted by the severity of the threat, negative affect, and liking for the character. However, when the character was harmed or killed, negative affect was a positive predictor of enjoyment of the episode only when the character was disliked. Liking for the character positively predicted the enjoyment of the threatening sequence regardless of the outcome. Gender differences in the relationship between negative affect and enjoyment were also observed. Negative affect was associated with greater enjoyment of the threatening sequence for men only, but was related to more enjoyment of the episode for both genders."

The weblog is a medium through which authors (bloggers) can develop an individualized web presence that reflects facets of their personal life, opinions and interests. At the same time, it opens a communicative basis for its readers and writers because of the possibility to post comments on the personal diary. We conducted an online survey with 79 blog authors and 172 recipients in order to investigate the individual motivations for writing, reading and commenting on weblogs in consideration of the gender and age of the participants. In study 1, we assessed via self-report the contents bloggers are writing about, their motives to provide information and their attitudes towards positive and negative feedback. Study 2 focused on the audience of weblogs whose motivations and preferences are underresearched. We were interested in their motives to read and to react on the digital diary of people they do not know personally. Altogether, results indicate that male readers are primarily interested in informative weblogs and that especially male bloggers serve this need while female bloggers prefer to write about personal experiences. Also, female bloggers were shown to be especially sensitive towards negative feedback. Young people tend to write more about personal experiences than older people do and make more extensive use of the interactive features."

If an infant or young child is experiencing physical distress, caregivers want to know how to respond quickly and appropriately, and are eager to learn more about childrens health as it is available. The current presentation provides results from a study of an exploratory pediatric website in which parents were asked to visit various doors, which led them to one of three areas: (1) childrens healthy eating habits, (2) newborn issues, and (3) what to do if a child is sick. A battery of literacy instruments, including the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) were administered in addition to knowledge retention instruments. These exercises were provided both before (pre) and after (post) the respondent explored the website in order to determine if parents retained the information provided. Results and implications of this study will be thoroughly explored throughout the presentation as well as avenues for larger research endeavors."

A Prolonged-Exposure Experiment,Is Entertainment Better Information? Wrapping Health Messages With a Smile: The Potential of Entertainment-Education Programs for Children and Adolescents,"The number of HIV-infections is still rising ¬ worldwide and in Germany. In 2005 about 2.600 Germans contracted the HIV-virus, which has been the highest infection-rate since 1995. At the same time peoples awareness of AIDS and HIV declines. Especially adolescents seem to neglect the threats of the virus. Information-based education programs (e.g., lessons at school) obviously fail to reach the adolescents.
Entertainment-Education programs provide an opportunity to reach target groups, information-campaigns fail to reach. Based on this approach we assume that a soap opera presenting an HIV-plot contributes more to the adolescents knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions than pure information programs. In order to test this hypotheses a prolonged-exposure experiment was run, in which students aged 12-15 were exposed to stimulus material on five consecutive days. Three experimental groups were run: Group 1 was exposed to a soap opera with HIV-related content, group 2 was exposed to pure information programs, group 3 (control group) saw the soap opera without HIV-related content (n=87). Three days later the students filled out a questionnaire about their HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. The results confirm our assumptions: HIV-related soap opera content contributes more to the students knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions than pure information programs. The latter in turn have a stronger impact than programs without HIV-related content."

Internet Use at Homes of Couples,Feminist Voices in Media Analysis,"Reports about the Internet use over the past years show that the number of male and female Internet users is adjusting (Groebel/Gehrke 2003:144). At a first glance one could think that the most popular digital divide , the gender divide, is dissolving. In this context Liff and Shepherd (2004) put the question: Do digital divides still matter? By only looking at the quantity of Internet users this approach is a limited analysis in terms of numbers if one likes to do research on the digital divide. For example reports from Great Britain show that the gender divide is not only represented by the data of being an Internet user or not but also the amount of the use and the way of using as well as the confidence in the own Internet use has to be considered (Liff/Shepherd 2004). Researchers who already analyzed and discussed statistical data of the Internet use, are demanding more qualitative studies, giving answers about the way males and females use the Internet (Liff/Shepherd 2004, Hargittai 2004). I argue that although the statistics indicate the diminishing of the gender gap it is still important to look with ethnographic studies how females and males are actually using and integrating the Internet into their everyday life. One important question is, does the progressive Internet use of couples lead to a dissolution of the traditional gender roles? A qualitative research design was employed to study based on in-depth interviews in Germany and Australia the Internet use of couples

Australian women tend to use the Internet in a time-saving way, getting household and children organization done, weather men are using it more to have time on their own or even to escape from the family while physically still being there. For men the Internet is being used in terms of their own work purpose or it is seen as a hobby. Women especially those with children dont have time to play with the Internet. The use is straighter forward and there has to be a purpose for going online. In Australia women with children often see the Internet as a household appliance, weather Australian men tend to put it to the group of media and communication technologies. In Germany the Internet is at this point not used for many household activities. Gender differences are more shown in the length of use, males being the ones who using it more and the competence in use, women being more reserved with new online activities."

It presents an auto-case study to argue that the inequities are rooted in institutional structures, practices and policies that support the academy as a masculine speech community that privileges white males at the expense of women and minorities, and it posits alternatives that draw on feminist values embedded in feminine speech communities. It concludes that two tactics that women and minorities can take to achieve justice and equity within the academy are: (1) conduct auto-case studies to document and create a broader understanding of the systemic nature of discrimination; and (2) engage in class action lawsuits and other collective action"

The racialized form of this branding results in a type of post-racial posturing and the gendered form of this branding becomes a post-feminist positioning. This paper examines how African American media mogul Tyra Bankss T-Zone foundation and camp, both does important work in the area of developing young womens self-esteem, and helps further Tyra Banks, and the Tyra brand, as a post-racial, post-feminist idol. In other words, I will examine the significance of Bankss philanthropy being dependent upon her articulation as a post- icon."

In these scenarios, video views and other visual information have been shown to be useful in the ongoing negotiation of common ground, but their actual impact on performance has been mixed. We argue here that one reason for this is that some means for providing visual information are more error-prone than others. One source of error is coupling, which we define as the extent to which changes in behavior are tied directly to changes in visual information. We present data from two laboratory experiments comparing three video-mediated communication systems that differ in the degree of coupling they exhibit. Results indicate that the moderately coupled system resulted in superior performance overall, but that participants had a slight subjective preference for the tightly coupled system on two dimensions of assessment."

To provide communication explanations on the politics of food which construct health discourses and affect peoples health status, the researcher have worked with South Korean peasant-activists and studied their communicative practices within the anti-globalization movement. Her approach was that of critical communication studies informed by the subaltern theory. Philosophy of solidarity in the subaltern theory presents a methodological concern: How do researchers go about enacting solidarity through their research? The biggest challenge for her was the position of privilege that she took for granted as an academic researcher. The issue of positionality implies distance between the marginalized and researchers. With this distance in between, how can we establish solidarity with the marginalized public? And how can an academic researcher work for progressive social change that leads to more sustainable and just food economy? This presentation will discuss how the peasant-activists and the student researcher are tackling these questions together."
2008-0439,Ethics Gaps and Ethics Gains: Differences and Similarities in Journalism Students Perceptions of Plagiarism and Fabrication,Journalism Ethics,,,,Paper,Ethics Gaps and Ethics Gains: Differences and Similarities in Journalism Students Perceptions of Plagiarism and Fabrication,Journalism Ethics,"Survey data on journalism students perceptions of plagiarism and fabrication indicate an ethics gap in which students with an interest in journalistic areas (newspaper, magazine, broadcast, photojournalism, and online) are more concerned about journalistic ethics than students with an interest in nonjournalistic areas (public relations, advertising, graphic design, and other). In addition, students interested in journalistic areas also suggested harsher penalties for plagiarism and fabrication than did students who expressed an interest in nonjournalistic areas. Further analyses, however, also found that the ethics gain among nonjournalistic students increased to a nearly equivalent amount as journalistic students over the course of their respective university educations and training experiences, including student media work and internships. Results from the study reported here demonstrate that while ethics gaps do exist between journalistic and nonjournalistic students, the ethics gains by students from both groups across levels of concern and the severity of penalties indicates that students ethical beliefs are malleable and show considerable growth during university education. Thus, student areas of interest are important pedagogical considerations and journalism curricula could be sharpened to better meet the needs of its many students with areas of interest outside of journalism careers. Nonetheless, the progression of students through their coursework demonstrated a positive effect on both journalistic and nonjournalistic students beliefs regarding fundamental journalistic ethics, which bodes well not only the future of journalism but also other media careers such as advertising and public relations."

This shift has given rise to a host of new media practices and products, such as mash-ups, remixes, mods, and machinima. However, cultural discourse about media practices are still mired in the black and white ethics of 20th century media distribution, and often framed in terms of piracy and theft. In this paper, we examine the self-reported attitudes of nearly 1,800 American adults, to discover what a new, and more appropriate, ethical discourse of configurability might look like."

Of the 629 reviewed public relations agencies, 234 (37%) provided an ethical statement. Among the ethical statements provided by these 234 public relations agencies, respect to clients, expertise and results were the values most frequently emphasized. On the other hand, balance, independence, fairness, social responsibility, and honor were the least frequently mentioned in the ethical codes. Also, none of the sampled agencies included any sanctions regarding enforcement of their particular codes of ethics."

The overall results showed that attitudes and subjective norms from the Theory of Planned Behavior were significantly related to intention to enroll while perceived behavioral control was not. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were significantly related to intention to talk with family. The differences among ethnic groups were small, but the relationship between attitudes and intention to enroll was stronger for Asian Americans and weaker for African Americans than for Caucasian Americans. The implications of these and other findings are discussed for organ donation campaigns."

A total of 1198 Muslims and non-Muslims participated in the study. The analysis reveals Muslims have higher levels of ethnic identification and religiosity than non-Muslims do. Furthermore, the results yielded a significant correlation between ethnic identification and religiosity in both nations (r = .777 in France and r = .721 in Britain); demonstrating individuals with high religiosity tend to have high ethnic identification. The article concludes by arguing religiosity and ethnic identification should be included in communication studies attempting to analyze culture on an individual level."
2008-0444,Ethnic Minorities in the Mass Media: Always the Same and Always Negative,Media Spectacles of Race,,,,Paper,Ethnic Minorities in the Mass Media: Always the Same and Always Negative,Media Spectacles of Race,"The perception of the other is a core aspect regarding the integration of ethnic minorities and migrants. It also includes the perception of ones own group and the feeling of being a part of this group. Group identities and stereotypes are important terms in this context. In most cases the perception of ones own group and other groups is communicated by representatives of the mass media. Perception and representation firstly mean the adequate or inadequate con-sideration from the respondents point of view. Furthermore it deals with the question whether - and how - identities and stereotypes of particular population groups are communicated. These questions have been examined in a qualitative analysis for which a total of six group discussions among immigrants and Swiss citizens with immigrant background were held in the German (Zurich), French (Geneva), and Italian speaking part of Switzerland (Lugano)."
2008-0445,Ethnographic Relay,"Culture, Media, and New Ethnography",,,,Paper,Ethnographic Relay,"Culture, Media, and New Ethnography","Fifteen years of multi-sited fieldwork have revised the tradition of ethnographic boundedness in place and time. Still, I am left to work out ethnography in cultural locations that cannot be pinned down in one place or many, where cultural producers act continuously as producers but also as citizens, as specialists and lay subjects, as prospectors and agents but also as objects, fans, community members and uncertain consumers. I do not want to ignore the specialty and privilege of cultural production, but I do want to find ways of imagining and studying culture as its practitioners move back and forth across the established dominions of producers, audiences, critics and agents of cultural change.

My stake in such conceptualizations is to soften fraught oppositions between insiders and outsiders, particularly in queer cultural production, and thus to soften the political rhetorics that attach to inside versus outside. The goal is not for queer and non-queer worlds to get along in a new politics of indifference, but to see and study queer/nonqueer encounter in cultural production in the present, asking about mutual influence and the hunger of dominant forms for subcultural energy and artistry. I have used the language of relay to articulate this critique. Relay refers to an ongoing, uneven process of cultural passing off, catching and passing on, if not always among members of the same team. It is not assimilation, hybridity, bricolage or even appropriation, though it shares with those ideas a mediating impulse and a lively aversion to hardened categories in cultural analysis. I intend it to mark cultural-economic difference and relation, a politics of recognition that sees both insider and outsider, and the materiality of practice, the idea that practice matters in non-dominant cultural production.

My method for studying queer cultural relay is ethnography of the traveling kind, moving in time and place, triangulating among various cultural sectors, treating ethnography itself as a practice of cultural relay and decompartmentalization among fieldworkers and cultural producers. My purpose in this paper will be to connect queer and ethnographic relay as conceptual and methodological counterparts, with the goal of cultural-political fruitfulnessthe identification of existing and future possibilities in cultural scholarship and cultural politics."

However, the process of transforming a mass-mediated campaign into one linked to interpersonal communication is not well understood or documented. Against the backdrop of a traditional model of campaign development, this paper explores how post-campaign actions, based on survey findings from an evaluation of a mass-mediated HIV/AIDS campaign, have led to the evolutionary redefining and reformulation of a mass-mediated campaign into one with an interpersonal dimension. The evolution of the second cycle of this campaign suggests a rethinking of the traditional model of health communication campaign development."

Thus, exposure to messages has become more and more important since advertisers recognize that without exposure to their messages persuading audience members about new products will prove tremendously difficult (Cho, 1999). This is especially difficult when the goal of the advertisement is to try and dispel widespread myths about the product, as is the case with the recent Get a Mac campaign by Apple computers. The advanced attention and comprehension that is often required by many of todays marketing campaigns are regularly mediated by a receivers previous attitudes or beliefs (Best, 2005). McGuires (1968) Information Processing Theory and Azjens (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior are used as a theoretical base for modeling antecents to attitude and behavior variables. Using advertisements from this campaign we found evidence of a re-emerging Apple culture. We address the role that myths may be playing in the purchasing intentions of consumers, and the potential halo effect being created by iPod ownership."

Results suggest that students receiving lecture/discussion and guided practice activity instruction show greater pretest to posttest gains in listening performance than students in a control group when evaluating emotional meaning. Students receiving lecture/discussion instruction showed greater gains than either control or guided practice activity students in understanding meaning in conversations. No differences were found across instructional groups for tests of following instructions, understanding lectures, or evaluating message content. Implications of these results, including implications for instruction, are addressed in the discussion section."

Visual archives such as Getty Images and Movietone Newsreels provide historical footage of WWII, while material from news organizations like CNN and ABC illustrate contemporary conflicts. The most deliberate use of reality footage is the series created by Kuma Reality Games. These game simulations are based on actual missions conducted by U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq, and are often available to the public within a few months following military action. As a result of this storytelling technique, games become an intertext to the Great War and the War on Terror. This paper examines how audiences respond to games with archival and current events news footage, exploring notions of authenticity and realism, and games as educational and supplemental news sources.

These data were then used to test the hypothesis that the information value for content words would be positively correlated with skin conductance change scores across variable time lags (1-4 seconds). Results support this prediction for six of the nine messages. Furthermore, support was found for the prediction that the duration of the optimal time lag would be positively correlated with the average information value of function words within the message after controlling for word rate in the message."

Legal anthropology informs us that congruence between general policy and its implementation is typically difficult to achieve. This has significant implications for policymakers everywhere as they try to adhere to assumed policy principles. This paper will use the Indian experience with the principle of technology neutrality to demonstrate that not only do larger policy objectives such as convergence depend on the operationalization of such components, but they too might evolve over time. Hence, we need to be concerned with not only the larger program and its outcome, but also its constituents. Understanding these processes of adjustment and evolution will help us predict better the outcome of important policy projects."

Patients may bring unreliable information to the physician and complicate physician-patient communication; or outside information seeking may complement physician information provision and reinforce patient responsibility for their own health. However, the descriptive evidence base is weak, and focuses primarily on the effects of the Internet on physician-patient relations, without addressing other sources of information. This study describes how often cancer patients bring information from a range of outside sources to their physicians; and the personal characteristics that are associated with bringing such information. It also describes the extents to which physicians send patients to other sources of information, and patient characteristics associated with referral. Participants are breast, prostate and colon cancer patients diagnosed in 2005 (n=1,594), randomly drawn from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry (PCR), who returned mail surveys in Fall of 2006 (response rate= 64 %.) Patients report that sharing outside information with physicians is common. Over 60% of patients brought information to their MDs, often from multiple sources. The information exchange mostly involves medical-professional and other interpersonal and print sources, with the Internet and other electronic sources playing a lesser role. Physician referral is less commonly reported by patients (44%), and is most frequently to other medical professionals, printed materials, or to other patients, and less frequently to interpersonal sources and mediated sources. Type of source, patient age and cancer type were predictive of sharing information with physician, and referral by physician."

Based on a conceptualization of the self as composed of many possible selves that serve behavior-regulatory functions, it was hypothesized that perceptions of the future self would predict intentions to use marijuana, and that a match between the future self and user prototype in terms of sensation-seeking/risk-orientation would predict intentions to use. Results of a survey of college students (N = 139) supported both hypotheses. Evidence was also found suggesting that one component of sensation-seeking may be viewed as potentially more pro-social than other components. It was further discovered that user-prototype attractiveness was highest among non-White, non-using males, and lowest among White, non-using males. To probe these findings, two focus groups consisting of African-American males and females (N = 12) were conducted. Consistent with findings, results indicated that social attractiveness of users was a common theme among males but not females. Implications for prevention programs and future research are discussed."

Results suggest positive affect state shifted the sufficiency threshold higher than negative affect, and despite no differences in processing depth, negative affect generated greater preference for the new student health plan. Of interest, those in the fear group were more willing than those in the anger group to accept more information. These results are discussed in terms of the nature of discrete emotional states, information seeking, and decision-making, and the implications for the HSM are explored."

A discourse analysis shows increased market segmentation over the years, as age classifications become more specific and targeted. The data show new markets emerging as particular age groups, such as children or older adults, come to be seen as viable target audiences over time. The data continue to show changes in how audiences are constructed by showing how these new markets create new boundaries around these more established markets. Finally, the data show that youth continues to valued over old age and that this is consistent throughout all five decades."

Sociometer theory posits from an evolutionary standpoint that self-esteem functions to regulate our pervasive need to belong. Due to the theory's psychological origins, the role of communication in the sociometric process has yet to be thoroughly discussed and analyzed. Therefore, the current study attempted to explore how communication influences the sociometer. More specifically, it was hypothesized that channel would moderate the impact of relational value cues on state self-esteem. In addition, cue ambiguity and positive face salience were examined as potential mediators of the aforementioned moderation."

This paper examines a unique experiential learning eventOne Homeless Nightoffered in Canada in 2005-2006 and the extent to which that event proved to be an effective way to communicate the complex nature of homelessness. The methods of research were participation by one of the researchers herself, observation, and interviews with participants. Results indicated increased understanding of the problem and increased empathy for the homeless. Based on these results, the authors recommend that similar events be designed and implemented in order to increase overall understanding of homelessness among members of the public, the media, and governmental officials. In addition, policy discussions generated by hosting such events will help institute best practices for reducing the incidence of homelessness."

Specifically, knowledge acquisition was investigated under conditions of medium and low news message arousal, with time delay. Results show the persistence of a knowledge gap, particularly for low arousing messages. In fact, at low levels of message arousal the gap tends to widen, while at medium levels of arousal the gap tends to shrink. Some existing research suggests that message salience explains the knowledge gap. Findings from this study show that information processing aptitude may also be a significant factor. Measures of several dimensions of participant motivation to cognitively engage with news messages were added as covariates to statistical analyses. These were found not to affect the knowledge gap outcomes in this data set."

Lay and intellectual critics alike expressed skepticism about the industrys concentration and power over democratic discourse, while precarious newsprint supplies and production workers unions challenged the press inordinate profitability. In the few years preceding and following passage of the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 the industry fought an intense battle for workplace control against the International Typographical Unions craft unionism philosophy and closed-shop practices. Newspaper publishers in turn used public relations practices and news outlets they owned to complicate public knowledge of labor relations within their own industry. This paper examines the underlying dynamics of this struggle alongside analysis of the specific pronouncements and themes the industry used to misrepresent this nationwide confrontation to the American public."

Across a variety of health domains, self-efficacy has been found to be one of the most consistent predictors of behavior change, but only a few HIV prevention interventions are focused explicitly on improving peoples efficacy beliefs. This paper is based on a formative evaluation conducted in Malawi to understand peoples barriers to enact HIV prevention behaviors. It is based on the assumption that barriers restrict peoples efficacy perceptions and that, in the absence of barriers, everyone would be perfectly efficacious. We have little theoretical guidance, however, on how to study barriers and how they can be meaningfully extracted from people. In this paper, through focus group discussions, we demonstrated the utility of a novel technique  called the Prompts for Eliciting Counterarguments (PEC)  to elicit relevant barriers to action. Barriers that emerged through the use of this technique were classified into three categories: sex as a desire and source of pleasure (at the individual level), difficulties in communicating about sex (at the interpersonal level), and larger societal issues around poverty in Malawi (at the societal level). Implications of this finding for HIV prevention efforts are also discussed in the context of a functional approach."
2008-0464,Exploring Anger as a Mediator of the Hostile Media Effect,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media II,,,,Extended Abstract,Exploring Anger as a Mediator of the Hostile Media Effect,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media II,"An overwhelming majority of Americans say they want their news to be bias-free (Project for Excellence, 2005), yet they believe news tends not to be objective (Pew Research Center, 2005). This perception of bias is thought to be associated with the decrease in trust in news and news consumption evidenced over the past two decades (Pew Research Center, 2006) which, in turn, is associated with less participation in productive democratic activities (Tsfati & Cohen, 2005; Tsfati & Peri, 2006). However, few studies have attempted to verify a causal link between perceptions of news objectivity and news consumption decisions. Of studies that have examined this association, results have been mixed. Some have found news credibility (or lack of bias) positively relates to news consumption whereas others found little correlation between the two variables (Kiousis, 2001; Pew Research Center, 2005; Rimmer & Weaver, 1987; Tsfati & Capella, 2003, 2005). We suggest that the discrepant findings may be due to the overwhelming focus on cognitive, fairly dispassionate evaluations of news stories and sources, without directly considering the effect of emotional responses to such stories on later consumption decisions. As emotions are not simply a response to our environment but also influence perception of situations, information preference, and desire for action (e.g., Lazarus, 1991), we suggest that attention to emotional reactions to perceptions of news bias could clarify the relationship between perceptions of bias, news consumption, and ultimately forms of democratic participation. In particular, we suggest that if judgments of news bias associate with anger, such judgments might result in more, rather than less, news consumption, given the approach, action-oriented response associated with that emotional state (e.g., Harmon-Jones & Allen, 1998)."
2008-0465,Exploring Causal Mechanisms of Other-Oriented Framing in the Context of the Avian Flu Context,High Density: Message Design Research,,,,Paper,Exploring Causal Mechanisms of Other-Oriented Framing in the Context of the Avian Flu Context,High Density: Message Design Research,"In recent years, tobacco prevention campaigns around the country have begun using messages that focus on the consequences to the health of a person other than the smoker. This other-oriented framing strategy could have implications beyond the smoking context. One area in need of new strategies is adult vaccine promotion, for which compliance is typically low (Blue & Valley, 2002). A previous study which randomized subjects to receive either a message about getting the avian flu vaccine to benefit the self, loved ones or unknown others (society in general), found that the society message resulted in the highest intentions to vaccinate and to seek out information (XXX, paper presented at ICA, 2007). In order to explore causal mechanisms of such an effect, the experiment was repeated and three potential mediators were measured. These included anticipated guilt, the amount of processing that occurred as a result of the message, and counter-arguing of the message. Results revealed that the groups did not differ on the amount of anticipated guilt elicited by the message. Nor did counter-arguing of the message by those in the self group (for which it was most personally relevant) explain the difference. However, the society-oriented messages resulted in significantly higher means on the amount of processing measure than the self condition (Mean=3.91, SD=1.56 compared to mean=3.33, SD=1.66). Path analysis reveals central processing is a significant mediator of the relationship between framing condition and intentions. Several potential implications of the findings are discussed."

They may even mean different things to the same person depending on the kind of movie being evaluated. The aim of the research reported in this paper is to explore basic dimensions of movie enjoyment and appreciation and underlying gratifications. Based on theoretical considerations and results of on an open ended pilot study, an item-pool of 86 items was constructed and used in a questionnaire study. Two hundred and sixty-eight participants rated their perceptions of a movie they had recently seen using these items. Exploratory factor analysis yielded the following dimensions: 1) deeper meaning/being moved, 2) fun, 3) lasting impression, and 4) suspense. For each dimension, items were selected for scale construction. Scale statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, and preliminary validation analyses yielded promising results."

In doing so, we also considered three theoretical positions: uses and gratifications, mood management and mood adjustment. Overall, there appears to be more solid support for mood management, although there is some evidence suggesting that all three theories may be operating in different stages of the media choice process. First, we found that high sensation seeking predicts a preference for more arousing movies, but also for sad movies. Low sensation seeking, on the other hand, predicts a preference for low arousal movies and high voyeurism is related to a preference for happy movies. Second those in a positive mood were more likely to choose happy, positively affective and arousing movies, suggesting that mood and movie choice may be congruent in some cases. Third, in testing the relative effect of all the variables on movie choices we found that personality predictors consistently predict movie choice, mood management was somewhat supported but only for those in a positive mood, and expectation for future activity did not consistently predict movie choice, offering least support for mood adjustment."

Based on theoretical considerations from motivational psychology and entertainment theory, two exploratory studies are reported. A correlational study suggests that avoiding failures is more critical to maintaining game enjoyment than achieving success. An experimental investigation (study 2) reveals complex relationships between pre-play and post-play self-esteem (assessed by implicit measures), game difficulty, and game enjoyment. A working model is derived from the findings that suggests differential processes in player performance, self-esteem, and game enjoyment for game experts and game novices. Performance seems to be much more relevant to the entertainment experience of game experts than it is for game novices."
2008-0469,Exploring the Effect of Audience Laughter on Information Processing,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media I,,,,Extended Abstract,Exploring the Effect of Audience Laughter on Information Processing,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media I,"The emergence of The Daily Show has brought about a new way of thinking about how news information can be presented to the television audience. Often referred to as ""fake news"", The Daily Show uses a humorous format to present current events in a substantive manner. This experiment investigates how content features, namely audience laughter, affects the cognitive processing of information. It is hypothesized that audience laughter in response to jokes in mediated messages will elicit an orienting response. This in turn will increase the probability of encoding information directly after a joke due to an increase in cognitive effort. Data has been collected and is currently being analyzed."

The primary focus of the research is attitude change, but issue involvement, attitude strength, perceived knowledge and need for cognition are measured to provide a more holistic analysis. Using one issue each to exemplify high, moderate and low engagement, participants were pre-tested, exposed to article and editorial cartoon pairs and post tested to assess change. Interestingly, a main effect of testing was demonstrated and as anticipated, and there was significant change in variables of interest in the low engagement issue when participants were exposed to on-topic media of any kind. While articles and matched article and cartoon pairs demonstrated more significance than cartoons alone, the existing effects help extend pre-existing theories in cognition and persuasion and also contribute to the growing body of scholarly research on the effects of editorial cartoons."

In particular, this essay will attempt to ascertain whether Race allows for a discursive interaction with the infinity of the face, which Levinas asserts is a process that must transcend the ego?s desire to know and objectify the world, and subsequently subsume it into the landscape of the mind?s terrain of objects to be know. As such, this essay will investigate whether the exhibit succumbs to what most of these theorists have identified as conventional visual culture?s, and science?s, tendency to advance objectifying subsumption logic, precluding the possibility of an ethical encounter with the face."

Abstract


This paper argues that the primary obstacles facing the transition to digital TV involve: (1) administrative infighting, (2) heavy-handed policymaking processes, and (3) the pursuit of self-interest and centralized control by the state network. After profiling Chinas television infrastructure, the paper concludes that the Communist Partys current policy initiative for the development of its digital television industry is not feasible."

Political science research demonstrates that the combination of these phenomena is of interest and is important for political life. The current investigation explores possible associations between exposure to news and entertainment genres and the combination of concern about security and political mistrust, using survey data (N =512) collected in Israel in the aftermath of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict. Results demonstrate that exposure to entertainment talk shows was related to a combination of concern about security and high levels of political trust, while exposure to political comedy was related to a combination of reduced concerns about security and lower levels of political trust."

It uses Benoits (1997) image repair theory. An analysis is conducted of a total of 54 statements, news releases, and reports Duke University released in response to the crisis. Results show the University relied on denial and mortification to defend its students and corrective action, bolstering, and attacking ones accuser to defend the university. Findings suggest a new defense category: expressing disappointment in group members. This new strategy allows the organization to take a ""wait and see"" position."

The article argues that media industry strategists behind such formats have come to rely on extending existing broadcast conventions of liveness and eventfulness, by means of audience participation via digital return channels. It argues that such participation invites a sense of presence, of heightened immediacy and involvement in the live event. The article emphasises how such features are being developed by the broadcast media industry to exploit audience participation for purposes of revenue, competitive edge and strategic expansion."
2008-0477,Face Goals in Conflict Avoidance: A Cross-Cultural Analysis,Top Three Student Papers in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,Face Goals in Conflict Avoidance: A Cross-Cultural Analysis,Top Three Student Papers in Intercultural Communication,"The current study examined how culture, other-positive, other-negative, self-positive, and self-negative face goals influence individuals use of three different avoiding behaviors, avoiding as if nothing has happened, avoiding current conflict and future relationship, and avoiding but seeking future revenge. Participants (US: N = 394; China: N = 259) reacted to created conflict scenarios. Several major findings resulted from this study. First, the main effects of national culture were quite strong in predicting the three avoiding behaviors in interpersonal conflict. Chinese were more likely than U.S. Americans to avoid the conflict as if nothing has happened or avoid future relationships with the other party in the conflict. Moreover, culture interacted with self-positive and other-negative face goals or self-negative and other-negative face goals to influence the use of avoiding future relationship and avoiding but seeking future revenge strategies. Self-negative and other-negative face goals were found to affect the use of avoiding as if nothing has happened and avoiding future relationships, whereas the other-positive face goal was found to affect the use of avoiding future relationships and avoiding but seeking revenge."

The facial expression of forty-two undergraduate and graduate students were recorded while they participated in an online shopping experiment where they rated twenty-four products pretested for humor and involvement levels and chose five final items to purchase. Datasets were then created by postprocessing the videos to extract the students facial features and the movements of these features were calculated using computer software. Finally, collected datasets were analyzed using two learning algorithm classifiers. The results were promising in that classifiers were able to predict buyer intent substantially above chance. Some of the best predictions were made regarding purchase likelihood of subjects, more specifically on humorous and high-involvement product datasets. Theoretical implications and possibilities for practical applications using facial expressions as predictors of online buying intention are discussed based on these results."

Social facilitation theory is used to explain the potential for audience presence to influence the gaming experience. To this end, a 2 (game skill) x 2 (game challenge) x 2 (audience presence) mixed-factorial design was used to test the potential for dominant game skill and game challenge level to moderate the influence of audience presence on performance and enjoyment in a video game context. The pattern of findings associated with a three-way interaction closely mirrors hypotheses predicting that when game challenge is low, the presence of an audience benefits the performance of high skill gamers significantly more than low skill gamers, but when game challenge is high the added benefit to high skill gamers is lost."

Based on the previous research of other authors and the process of collecting the rules that young adults use in their friendship relationships, an IR-1 self-assessment measure was developed that consisted of 141 friendship-related rules which was applied on a large set of subjects (N=501) in the age of early adulthood. A factor analysis of the IR-1 items revealed five dimensions of rules in friendship relationships that were labeled benevolence, sociability, appropriateness, self-control, and self-directedness. The NEO PI-R inventory, which measures the personality dimensions according to the five-factor model of personality, was applied on a smaller subset of subjects (N=114) together with the IR-1 measure. Many statistically significant correlations were uncovered between the dimensions of interpersonal rules on the one hand, and the personality dimensions and their facets on the other hand, most of which were related to extraversion and agreeableness. The five uncovered factors of interpersonal rules were used for the development of a self-assessment instrument IRF-2 with 60 items. In an additional study (N=61) the variables measured with the IRF-2 instruments were correlated with measures of friendship quality and the results indicated that the use of positive rules in friendship associated with the dimensions labeled benevolence and sociability had the largest positive influence on the quality of friendship with a best friend."

An exploratory factor analysis yielded 8 Chinese culture value orientations, labeled as ""self discipline,"" ""temperament,"" ""hierarchical responsibility,"" ""moral values,"" ""social stability,"" ""professional ethics,""relational reciprocation,"" and ""affective neutrality."" The findings also revealed that culture did have impacts on perceptions of the relational cultivation strategies in the Chinese organization-public context, although the maganitudes are not large. Hierarchical responsibility affected four out of the seven cultivation strategies. Relational reciprocation affected the perception of networking, openness, and sharing of tasks; while professional ethics significantly contributed to the perception of being unconditionally constructive. A discussion of the cultural value scale and findling implications is provided."
2008-0482,Factors Affecting Attitude Toward Shopping for Real and Virtual Items on Social Networking Websites,Online Persuasion,,,,Paper,Factors Affecting Attitude Toward Shopping for Real and Virtual Items on Social Networking Websites,Online Persuasion,"Academics and industry people have singled out social networking websites for having vulnerable business models. In that regard, it is imperative for social networking websites to establish stable revenue structures. This study suggests shopping services as a possible service area that social networks could enter into. Integrating a technology acceptance model with other perceptions and user characteristics, this study identifies factors affecting attitude toward real items (e.g., books and computers) and virtual items (e.g., profile layouts and avatars) on social networks. The findings show that younger people with positive perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, security of shopping services on social networks, and fit between social networks and the items being sold have a more favorable attitude toward shopping for real items. On the other hand, females who use social networks less but who have a positive perception of ease of use and fit have a more positive attitude toward shopping for virtual items."

However, national surveys indicate a trend of consumers declining trust in DTC advertising. What kind of impact can these messages have if the information they present is not deemed trustworthy by consumers? In this paper, we report on exploratory research to examine how general trust of DTC advertising is connected to such key factors as consumer attitudes toward this category of advertising and interactions with physicians as well as other behaviors related to health information seeking. Our findings indicate high awareness of DTC advertising but neutral attitudes and trust toward these ads. Attitudes toward DTC advertising were the primary predictor of trust while attitudes towards the usefulness of information presented in these ads revealed the most impact on trust. Future research should investigate how the impact of consumers perceptions of trust regarding pharmaceutical companies influences their perceptions of the trustworthiness of DTC ads and the impact on advertising outcomes."

One reason might be that these participants judged deception materials featuring lots of felt emotion. This presentation will discuss a study that will look at a group of British Police officers, from the homicide, fraud, pedophile, and patrol squads, and compare their accuracy at detecting deception. It will also examine whether their abilities to detect subtle microexpressions of emotion are correlated to their accuracy judgments. The results showed that the Homicide squad outperformed the other police squads, and all 3 of the detective squads outperformed the patrol squad. These findings will then be further discussed in terms of subtle nonverbal signals and how officers job requirements may help or hinder their abilities to detect them."

It seeks to establish a baseline of what groups are portrayed in staff-written articles and finds that some changes reflect critics concerns while others might appear to amplify them. Of particular interest is the growth of an instrumental values coverage with little or no overt connection to the religious precepts that underlie its topics and a conflation of religion and political news.

Tracing the Assumed Links Between Interpersonal Contact and Intercultural Tolerance",Intercultural Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"Interpersonal contact is increasingly seen as one of the key tools for generating social cohesion and reducing racism in urban settings. However, while the interpersonal encounter is often an essential conduit in the imagination of sociocultural change, a thorough understanding of the concrete negotiations that individuals engage in within such encounters is still lacking. This paper analyzes the discursive, social and historical practices that take place within the interpersonal encounters that were organized through a campaign for urban social cohesion in Amsterdam called we Amsterdammers. The analysis shows how interpersonal contact at these projects implicitly sought to bring the white Dutch majority into contact with its cultural others in order to debunk the stereotypes of the former. However, this often failed because of a predominance of white Dutch participants. In those situations where cross cultural contact was established, members of cultural minorities were positioned as representatives of their cultural communities and expected to demonstrate the harmlessness and inconsequentiality of their cultural difference. An unequal relation was thus created between participants from different groups and existing group identities, boundaries and relations were reproduced in the name of social cohesion and cultural tolerance. Suggestions are made for a theorization of interpersonal contact in such contexts from a discursive socio-historical perspective in order to bring issues of subjectivity, power and ideology more clearly into consideration."

Specific aims of the paper are to 1) examine use of three distinct types of interactivitymedium, mediated-human and human interactivity; 2) assess and compare interactivity scores between 2002 and 2006 nominees; 3) analyze repeat nominees and winners, and 4) assess whether the ONA is properly rewarding interactive efforts by online news publications. Results reveal that implementation of medium interactive features increased while mediate-human interactive features decreased and human interactive features remain nearly absent. 2006 nominees and repeat nominees scored higher on the interactivity scale. Implications of the findings are discussed. (114)"

The objective of this study was to learn more about how users feel about their online privacy while using Facebook, as well as to understand user reaction to the introduction of a new and controversial feature on Facebook known as ""the feed"". The study found that while some users may be concerned about their personal privacy, the majority will continue to disclose personally identifying information as a signaling tool to their peers. It was also determined that most users did not change their privacy settings after the introduction of ""the feed"" despite what appeared to be widespread unrest among the user base."

It was found that, overall, thin females were overrepresented in the videos. More interestingly, the body sizes of the female characters varied by three of the four video themes. When the music videos were high in sex, or high in materialism, women were more likely to have smaller body sizes. In contrast, when the videos were high in political awareness, women were more likely to have larger body sizes. The implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed."

This study analyzes news articles about Ms Lokko through feminist epistemologies of ignorance. A textual analysis of the media articles within the theories of feminine representation in the media and the epistemologies of ignorance in the frames of stories about Ms. Lokko were employed. The purpose of this study is not to prove the rightfulness or wrongfulness of the administrative capabilities embedded in the discussions. Instead, it discusses the frames of ignorance that directs her representation in the media by deconstructing the medias use of words in discussing her case and how her gender influences the meanings of these words."

They are accompanied by merchandising items, tie-ins, spin-offs and product placement joint-ventures. Finally, a blockbusters life cycle stretches well beyond theatrical exhibition in first- and re-run cinemas, involving home video distribution and retail, DVD-releases, and TV-premieres. At the core of the blockbuster concept thus seems to lie the appeal to already existing, and therefore definable, target audiences. Conglomerate ownership of talent and material across a wide range of media has played a crucial role in this cross-fertilisation and multi-media exploitation. My paper aims to provide insight into the cultural logic and significance of the movie blockbuster within contemporary entertainment, both in relation to the conglomeration of production and marketing and in respect to trans-national patterns of reception and audience appropriation.

Yet because that it is taken for granted as already critical, the idea and benefits of meta-criticism might not be foreseen with ease. Through criticizing the way that film criticism is exercised today and emphasizing the preclusive effects of an objectifying and deterministic way of writing on the utility of criticism, this presentation will reconsider the relation of criticisms to the films they are analyzing and offer a new way of writing that would try to render this relation a more prolific and communicative one.

Moving from John Austins analyses of language in speech situations under the name of performative uttereances where we not only say words but act through them, this study considers the filmic experience as a contingent language situation in an Austinian sense where film performs with and through the audience. As a second step, this study tries to see how critical writing itself can be performative as well in relation to the work it is analyzing. Therefore performative writing is employed as a new way of criticism for the film Possible Worlds which was directed by Robert Lepage and which was an inspiring experience for me to formulate this study since that I consider this movie as resistant to any transcription in a criticism as in the way it has been executed so far. In the final stage of this presentation, performative writing and the play-space that it could offer for a more communicative criticism will be pondered on."

Both visions for journalism are built on tensions and aspirations concerning the gap between community living and public deliberation, a better interaction between the modern systems of governance and the daily life of citizens. This paper offers theoretical, empirical and methodological lessons of public journalism experiments in print newspapers in order to highlight important insights for the study and development of participatory journalism practices on the web. The paper argues for a contextually sensitive framework that makes sense of the new possibilities and considers the demands placed on the mediated public sphere constructed in journalism.

Theoretically, the paper explores roles assigned to professionals, citizens and news sources in these experimental visions. Empirically, 1) the in-depth interviews of newspaper journalists shed light to the way professionals view the challenges; 2) focus group sessions with newspaper readers illuminate the ways in which readers everyday life can be seen as networked existence and 3) various journalistic experiments point out to the difficulties of creating genres for participatory journalism. All these lessons from public journalism inspired projects can offer valuable insights for the debates that inform the reflective development of journalism (professional and not) in the era of Web 2.0."
2008-0494,Fixing the Meaning of Change: Analysis of Change Management Meeting Excerpts,Multiple Perspectives on Organizational Crisis and Change,,,,Paper,Fixing the Meaning of Change: Analysis of Change Management Meeting Excerpts,Multiple Perspectives on Organizational Crisis and Change,"Although research on organizational change has achieved significant growth in developing variable-analytic models with the purpose of predicting change outcomes and stage-models in mapping change trajectories, our understanding of how change is implemented in micro-practices and managed in situated interactions is very limited. Recent development calls for a performative and discursive approach to organizational change. Responding to this call, this study investigates how organizational change takes place in discourse as attempts to fix the meaning of change. Specifically, this paper examines several excerpts of a change management meeting among the CEO, his top management team, and middle managers in the headquarter of a large U.S. insurance corporation. Drawing upon Laclau and Mouffe (1985) and Foucault (Foucault, 1972), the study demonstrates the process in which organizational members fixed the meaning of change by articulating change into preferred larger discourses while (re)producing specific control relationships through talk in interaction. The study also demonstrates how managerialism was enacted in discourse that suppressed conflict and genuine dialogue."

Flexibility circulated as a means of production, a requirement for workers, and a means through which employees could receive better benefits. Particularly, flexible working conditions became publicized as a way that wives and mothers could be better accommodated in the workplace. Workplace flexibility was articulated to feminism throughout public discourse. Yet by the end of the 20th century, flexibility had failed to uproot standard time-intensive models of work, and seemed to have excluded some women from job opportunities and job security. Then, when flexibility appeared to be unable to live up to its promises of relief, feminism was blamed for many womens difficulty balancing family and work. The papers three sections work through this trajectory, starting with analysis of academic and mainstream texts that discussed flexibility as a mode of work. I then move to flexibilitys articulation to feminism in current events writing as well as the film 9 to 5, and conclude by analyzing public blame placed on feminism for flexibilitys unfulfilled promises."

Comparing Local Food Activism Across Three Regions,The Social Impact of Strategies and Tactics in Activist Organizing,"Contemporary movements aimed at re-localizing food systems reflect the growing realization that global forces such as neoliberalism only achieve concrete existence at local scales. This study explores how community activists located in the Northeast, Southeast, and Northwest regions of North Carolina, USA are organizing around food as a glocal economic justice issue. Although each region has distinct geographies, histories, and cultures, they each also encompass counties defined by the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service as persistently poor, i.e., for the past 30 years, 20 percent or more of their populations have been living in poverty. Drawing from a combination of participant observations, interviews, and discourse analysis, the study discusses how attempts to organize around food issues engender a politics of scale that reflect, and are variously impacted by, each regions unique economic, social, and political characteristics."

However, in line with Forbidden Fruit Theory, we argued that such labels might increase the games attractiveness for youth. Therefore, a 3 (age groups: 7-8, 12-13, 16-17 years old)*2 (sex)*5 (PEGI age labels)*3 (violence vs. non-violence content labels) mixed design experiment was conducted. Three personality traits (i.e. Reactance, Trait Aggressiveness, and Sensation Seeking) were also included. Participants (N = 310) rated fictitious video game descriptions accompanied by one or no PEGI label. Results revealed that higher age labels as well as a violent label made the games more attractive than the no label control condition. A violent content label evoked similar likeability effects as 18+ age labels by all age groups (even the 7-8 aged and the girls). Thus, while the PEGI-system was developed to protect youth from objectionable content, our results in fact show that age labels and violence content labels increase the games attractiveness in youth, even in the very young ones."

First, information such as genres, origins, and proportion of foreign films in the American film market is given out to describe the overall situation of foreign film consumption in the U. S. The advantages and limits of Uses and Gratifications and Cultivation in explaining film effects among audiences are discussed as theoretical background of this study. Following the overall discussion, I will specify research questions and research design in the methodology part, including measurements of foreign language film exposure. Finally, I will discuss the relationship between foreign language film consumption and audiences beliefs about them, together with the impact of such consumptions on perceptions of social reality."

Traditional efforts to engage young people in democratic life have largely been relegated to Government and Political Science courses and have primarily focused on teaching large amount of historical and political information. Infocentric approaches, ironically, have done little to motivate young people to care about their systems and tend to deny three realities of college students, including how many of them: do not like politics, are not easily inspired by sanitized civic discourses, and have a difficult time learning empowered citizenship in the hidden (hierarchical) curriculum of the schools. This paper reports on a program that uses narrative theory, role models, a group assignment and documentary filmmaking to re-engage university level Communication students in civic life. Specifically, we detail how the American Trustees project makes civics instruction more concrete and meaningful, how it gives students opportunities to exercise agency and engage in self-reflection, and how it provides cues to a new, more youthful language of citizenship (as these films are created by and for young people). An evaluation of the course provides encouraging findings as well as questions for future research."
2008-0500,For Us Only?: Perceiving Bias in Black Entertainment,New Directions in Third Person Effects Research,,,,Paper,For Us Only?: Perceiving Bias in Black Entertainment,New Directions in Third Person Effects Research,"Whereas existing research on the effects of media portrayals of African-Americans suggests that negative portrayals reinforce implicit racial attitudes, other findings suggest that African-Americans highly identify with Black media characters, even ones that may be considered stereotypical. Further, research reveals that stereotypical portrayals can be perceived to be enjoyable. Applying hostile media and third person theories, the purpose of this study was to explore African-Americans enjoyment of stereotype, as well as locate the context in which Black audiences may perceive bias. Findings reveal an effect of race of co-viewer on enjoyment experience. Further, yielding a third person effect, findings revealed Black audiences ambivalent attitudes toward Black entertainment embedded with negative portrayals. Black audiences reported concern for the effects of Black entertainment on White audiences."

Overall, this studys findings suggest that the governor group was most successful in shaping coverage of the issue; its message frame was most frequently and dominantly reflected in news stories. The governor group also contributed the most direct quotes to news stories. The federal government group failed to be as influential as the governor group in shaping news content, particularly in the dominance aspect. The industry and consumer groups had little influence over news stories, in that their message frames were rarely presented via news coverage."

The notion of framing is explored as a vehicle for public argument, including strategies of representation, modes of inference, and justificatory reasoning. This perspective is used to illustrate the differences in framing across Arab media outlets, in particular between Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya, as representative of differing norms of media framing - especially pertaining to coverage of the United States. Frames are presented as ""argument"" practices, which suggest specific strategies for the design of messages to be circulated in U.S. public diplomacy efforts in the region. Comparative analysis of argument patterns in media framing elaborate the challenges to international communication interventions that transcend reaction to unpopular foreign policy and address the media as a distinct arena of conflict."

Overall, the content analysis revealed that negative frames dominated the news coverage of the educational crisis, especially at the first stage of the crisis. The survey indicated that attention to media coverage about the educational crisis affected teachers' perception of the educational reform. Taken together, the content analysis and survey complemented with each other and mildly extend the framing analysis by showing that episodic-thematic coverage differed by the valence of news frames"

We are trying to answer two questions: (1) How did American elite newspapers cover these two Head-of-state visits? (2) How did the image of China in American newspapers change historically from 1972 to 2006? Through a qualitative framing analysis, this study found that the dominant ideology in American society functioned as the main source of framing in the coverage of the Presidents visits. Both of the two newspapers coverage reflected the ideology of anti-communism in the 1970s and Chinas threat as a superpower in late 1990s. However, the analysis also demonstrated that the contingent ideology and journalistic ideology in the newsroom also played an essential part in news judgment."
2008-0505,Framing Corporate Social Responsibility for Capital Market Communications,"Public Relations Unplugged: Crisis, Reputation, and CSR",,,,Paper,Framing Corporate Social Responsibility for Capital Market Communications,"Public Relations Unplugged: Crisis, Reputation, and CSR","The empirical findings presented in this paper were gained from interviews with equity analysts at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The interviews sought to identify how mainstream equity analysts, that are not particularly involved in Socially Responsible Investment research, perceive the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility. On the one hand, the evidence suggests that ecological, social and governance issues are increasingly becoming part of mainstream investment analysis. However, in order to gain legitimacy among capital market participants, sustainability issues have to be communicated and framed according to the financial communitys perspective. In particular, the impact of CSR measures on a companys strategic development, its corporate governance, image and employee relations seem to be most relevant to the financial community. Based on our findings, we propose that CSR issues could become a greater component of investor relations activities, if framed appropriately."

In order to regulate the press market and bring about equality of press competition, the Act to Guarantee Freedom and Functions of Newspapers (Newspapers Act) of 2005 was enacted.
This study aims to investigate how newspaper organizations frame the Korean Newspapers Act in their news coverage over three time periods  the enactment, the petition, and the Supreme Court decision. From two mainstream newspapers and two reform newspapers, total 282 news articles were qualitatively analyzed. In mainstream newspapers, two dominant frames, such as Governmental Control of the Press Frame and Oppression Autonomous Market Frame, were found. Reform newspapers have Press Reform Frame. In minor frames, mainstream newspapers framed this law as Evil Law and exaggerated Freedom of Press Frame, whereas reform newspapers have Fair Law Frame and Legitimate Law Frame focusing on Social Responsibility of the Press. In this study, differences in news frames between mainstream and reform newspapers were clear. Since news organizations framed the new law according to their interests, ideological orientations of news organization reflected representation of the issue."

Critics have argued that the medias representational strategies have deteriorated, going from more moderate approaches to a classically Orientalist framework.
In this system of thought, the world in divided in Manichean terms: on the one side are the forces of destruction represented by terrorism, rogue states, and Islamist extremism, and on the other are the champions of democracy and freedom, represented by the US and its allies.Thus, when Muslims protested the cartoons published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in September 2005 that caricatured Islam, they were denounced for not appreciating western values of free speech. When a United Arab Emirates company was to take over the running of six U.S. ports from a British company in early 2006, a xenophobic backlash was unleashed and it was argued that those people cannot be trusted with the security of our ports. The Pope, in a speech in Germany in 2006, suggested that Islam was violent and that reason was more at home in the West.
The stunning internal consistency of these and other arguments deserve scholarly attention. In this paper, I draw on existing literature on Orientalism to analyze the old and new ways in which Arabs and Muslims have been demonized post 9/11. I offer five discursive frames that have been employed to represent Muslims, Arabs, and the Middle East post 9/11."

Based on the framing theory, this study content analyzed 1,197 postings on twenty South Korean legislators blogs. Variables included how often the blogs were updated, the length of postings, the author of the postings, the tone of the postings, and the issues discussed. Results showed that the leading opposition Grand National Party (GNP) legislators were more active in blog communication than their counterparts, the ruling party Uri legislators. Overall, the legislator blogs were updated approximately once a week by posting one or more new content at the length of three pages on average. As for bylines of postings, the two major parties blogs showed both common and different points. The opposition partys legislators showed more negative postings on blogs than their counterparts. The ruling partys legislator blogs posted slightly more personal stories/interests than policy/political issues, while the major opposition partys legislator blogs showed more policy postings. Finally, practical implications were discussed based on similarities and differences in the two major party legislators blog communication."

Extending research propositions from the decision sciences and political communication, the current research tests the influence of different types of emphasis frames on increasing consumer willingness to pay for the PHR. Using a randomized experiment embedded within a probability survey, the effects of three different types of emphasis frames (episodic, thematic, and joint) along with no frames control group are tested on a sample of early and later technology adopters. The results indicate a significant relationship between the type of frame and the type of adopter. Early adopters were more susceptible to episodic frames that made causal attributions at the individual level, while later adopters were significantly influenced by thematic frames that made causal attributions at the societal level. Interestingly, the framing effect continued and significantly influenced both early and later adopters willingness to pay for the PHR. The findings demonstrate the need to carefully communicate the value of a technology to adopters and suggest the possibility of using frames to spur the diffusion of PHRs."

The authors conducted a content analysis of bilingual education coverage in the states two largest newspapers: the Los Angeles Times and the San Francisco Chronicle between 1998 and 2002. Utilizing agenda setting theory and a two-dimensional definition of salience (McCombs & Shaw, 1972; Nelson & Kinder, 1996) the authors explored the ways in which Latinos as a racial/ethnic referent became a working routine for journalists covering bilingual education. A second research question examined the possibility that local-level coverage mediated the conflation of Latinos with bilingual education by showcasing racial/ethnic diversity of people affected by bilingual programs. Analyses indicated that local coverage may be substantively different from macro-level coverage, but that future research is needed to discern the mechanisms of this difference."

In our larger and continueing investigations around the handloom as technology, we examine the epistemological conditions that define notions of Innovation of Technology within Modernity and Enlightenment discourse driven economic Development. We reflect on the questions raised, not so much from an intervention angle, but for positioning traditional knowledges and epistemologies in contemporary times while problematizing the very conceptual categories of traditional and modern. While implicitly and explicitly working against modern day received views about technology (Slack and Wise, 2005, p. 2) we examine the loom as technology, embedded in everyday life where the interplay between economics and culture is inseparable. Thus we take seriously the notion of technological cultures as articulated by Wise and Slack and work through particular contexts of pitt loom and frame loom in rural South India.
Our focus, therefore, will be on examining practices in context in relation to socio-economic and cultural practices around particular instances of weaving fabric in rural South India - the frame loom and the pit loom. Laying out particular narratives and descriptions of how these two developed side by side in a certain time-frame in rural south India, we examine structures and hierarchies that emerge as interweaving and inseparable from practice (of production and consumption)."

Much scholarship has been devoted to both media framing of conflict coverage and the theoretical concepts of war journalism and peace journalism, but little research has empirically tested the concepts as competing frames in the coverage of conflict. Findings, based on a content analysis of 564 articles from the highest-circulation native-language newspaper in each country, reveal differences in the way each framed coverage: the U.S. newspaper demonstrated the strongest war journalism framing, the Chinese newspaper a unanimous peace journalism framing, the Japanese and Russian newspapers strong peace journalism framings, and the South Korean newspaper the strongest neutral framing. The three most salient indicators of war journalism are an elite orientation, a focus on the here and now, and a partisan approach. Peace journalism frames are supported by an avoidance of emotive language, an avoidance of demonizing language, and a multiparty orientation."

Using political economy and Jhallys (1993 and 2000) theories on the way the marketplace structures our relationship to society, this paper examines the impact of capitalist market structure on public dialogues about rebuilding the city. The case study analyzes an event held at Xavier University of Louisiana that involved community organizations, activist, journalist, and the Xavier community in a dialogue about community development. The dialogue was analyzed to assess the strength of a free-market approach that frames rebuilding as economic progress to the detriment of particular communities in the city  those without economic power. While the free-market structures public engagement, participants also criticize unregulated economic and social policies that favor private corporate interests over the public good."

The history of any major modern technological development is shadowed by the infrastructure that supports it. As technics of motion, automobiles take up twice their volume in space, as any single automobile that is put to use requires two spaces to occupy: one for there it is at the moment and one for its eventual destination. Any intervening space is almost incidental - automobiles spend 95% of their time stationary. The road permits the car to fulfill its function; the parking space permits the car to exist at all. In exploring the impact and implications of parking, it is possible to separate the concerns into what may be seen as the five great issues: aesthetics, practicality, efficiency, safety, and sociability. This paper is an exploration of where parking intersects with these concerns, and the insights that parking offers into modernity at large."

Activist Encounters With Old and New Media Technology * (TOP STUDENT PAPER IN CAT)","Self, Society, and Technology","This paper contextualizes discourses surrounding new media technologies by examining activism around independent media, using as a case study an activist group who since the mid-1990s have advocated for greater citizen access to low power FM (LPFM) radio. The continuing interest in the viability of FM radio demonstrates the need for a nuanced understanding of the uses and impacts of communication technologies. I argue that the significance of new media technologies can be grasped most effectively when considered in a dynamic field that includes older technologies; emerging technologies are often viewed through the lens of patterns of use and interpretation of older technologies, at least initially. I follow the activists assessments of not only FM radio but emerging digital technologies, including webstreaming, smart (or software-defined) radio, and wi-fi networks. In practice, the activists circumspectly negotiate expanding their efforts to encompass community wi-fi networks, while trying to retain the vision, flavor, and organizing strategies from their LPFM campaigns. I trace the tensions they experience as they consider the implications of this shift for their emphasis on a grassroots mandate, for their policy work versus hands-on technical work, and for their identification with FM radio technology versus the inclusion of computer and wi-fi technology in their conception of their work. By attending to the interplay of old and new technical options, it is possible to better understand the trajectory of technological adoption without relying on deterministic or revolutionary explanatory mechanisms."

My paper based on the work of the early German sociologist Georg Simmel in identifying the ""Fremde"" (foreigner, other) in the socialization process looks at the negotiation of the borderlands.
In one of its cyclical efforts to combat domestic xenophobia, the German government coined the slogan: We are all foreigners somewhere. It begs the question of indigeneity. Where are we indigenous? Germany in all of its various transitions of nation-state identity has had a vast troubled history of relating to tribal roots; this is especially problematic for the German national identity and its sponsorship of the Jewish holocaust. It is further reflected in such primal National Socialistic propaganda as ""The Triumph of the Will"" and traditions of racial purity that demanded racial passports. On the other hand, while deeply conflicted in coming to terms with our own indigenous roots and their consequences, we continue to identify with the mythological American Southwest, especially as reflected in such cultural artifacts as our own literary tradition of Karl Mays work. How can reflections on this cultural displacement of indigeneity lead to new insights in cross-cultural communication and multicultural alliances?"

The study looks at several newspapers within these coutries from the years of 2005 and 2006. Specifically, it investigates coverage during this time period concerning both the 7/7/05 London bombings and the 08/10/06 transatlantic terror plot. The study will employ CRA (Centering Resonance Analysis) to evaluate the frames chosen to present the incidents in British and American media. The content analysis findings are extended to actual political elite statements and opinions in an effort to support Bennetts indexing theory and further it to a context of framing and terrorism."

As noted advertising critic Judith Williamson might suggest, Goodwills advertising strategy leads us to think that the donation process shown in the ads is how we should view charity: a sanitary experience completely removed from those who benefit from the charitable act, and thus different from experiences with charities that bring the donor closer to the poor. The ads suggest that they just want the satisfaction, not to mention the congratulations, that come with the charitable act, at least as it is configured in this campaign. The closest the viewer gets to the poor is in the character of the Goodwill driver. He unmistakably represents the working poor. He has a good, if unglamorous job. While the ads are not necessarily aimed at poor individuals, the drivers presence suggests to them the value of working hard so that they keep their jobs, and stay off of welfare. Moreover, the donors and shoppers in the ads never come in direct contact with him. The poor can be kept at arms length. Yet at the same time, the driver is positioned as the expert, the keeper of the knowledge that Goodwill donors and shoppers must master in order to take part in this more commodified version of the Goodwill experience. But they do so totally oblivious to the plight of the people helped by the application of their expertise through giving or shopping."

As social networking cases begin to appear in court, the body of law on student expression suggests the outcome of these cases. The purpose of this paper is to examine the courts positions on protection of off-campus online speech for public high school and university students and how this jurisprudence applies to the way schools monitor, restrict, and punish students use of social networking sites. Precedents suggest that a public universitys restriction of Facebook for its students almost always would violate their First Amendment rights, and a public high schools restriction of Facebook use for students often would violate their First Amendment rights."

Not hesitating to affirm and strongly reiterate a deliberate conservative program, Nicolas Sarkozy thus pushed Far Right Politician Jean-Marie Le Pen to a distant corner of the political arena. He then skillfully cut the ground under his Socialist opponent, Ségolene Royal, by a clever switch to his left, visiting workers in factories and pronouncing some speeches which a socialist candidate could have endorsed. A tactics of daily announcements to the media also helped putting him ahead.
Now President, he seems to maintain the same strategy, not hesitating to overwhelm journalists with a seemingly permanent activity, in the line of Tony Blair spin-doctoring. But he is also innovating by calling disappointed high ranking left leaders to come and help him, making his opponents nearly inaudible. He is also preserving a political agenda which cleverly includes some matters also taken to the left ""traditional"" values, like for instance a strong environmental reform even staged with grandeur with Al Gore support."

The embedding of televisual texts in the everyday life patterns of their audiences has thus long been a focal point of television studies (cf. Silverstone 1994).

However, recent studies of audiences of popular televisual texts and of fan audiences in particular have suggested that the multiplicity of texts in multi-channel television and in a multi-mediated environment have led to the erosion of textual boundaries set by producers and to an overflow of textuality in which audienceship automatically involves acts of authorship in the selection of texts and paratexts creating textual fields corresponding with viewers horizon of expectation. This paper considers the conceptual and methodological consequences of the changing nature of textual (over)flow based on a qualitative study using continuous hard-disc recordings of television viewing by viewers in UK households in order to trace the construction of textual boundaries in television consumption.

2008-0523,From Media Events to Computer Games: Mediatization as Branding Religion,Media Cultures and the Mediatization of Religion,,,,Paper,From Media Events to Computer Games: Mediatization as Branding Religion,Media Cultures and the Mediatization of Religion,"During the last years religion went a more and more important topic in German media culture. A break for this was the election of the German pope and the catholic World Youth Day  both impressive media events. But also looking at the Internet and computer games religion is a topic again. Based on large scale empirical studies on the World Youth Day (2005) and present digital religious worlds (2007), the paper argues that we can understand branding as one dominant pattern of the mediatisation of religion: Firstly, mediatization implies a pressure on different religions to communicate themselves in a quantitative perspective across different media. Only if a religious offer exists like a brand across the different media it has a chance to present itself in the centre of media cultures. Secondly, mediatization means that religious contents do lose their sacred, exclusive space of communication. The communicative space of the present media is increasingly a commercialised space of product competition. Therefore branding refers to the necessity of a self-presentation in the present media. In discussing this, the paper contextualises the process of mediatization of religion critically in its interrelation to a commercialization of religion."
2008-0524,From Media Response to Mediated Practices: The Challenges to Ethnographic Methodology,"Culture, Media, and New Ethnography",,,,Paper,From Media Response to Mediated Practices: The Challenges to Ethnographic Methodology,"Culture, Media, and New Ethnography","In the last 15 years, cultural scholarship on media ""audiences"" has moved away from studies of direct engagement with texts towards a consideration of ""mediated practices,"" recognizing the artificiality of attempting to dissect media out of the complex web of culture. From this perspective, the relevant questions about media are no longer what do media do to people and cultures? or even what do people do in direct response to media? Rather, as Nick Couldry suggests, If recent media research has foregrounded media culture, practice theory translates this into two concrete and related questions: what types of things do people do in relation to media? And what types of things do people say in relation to media? (2004, p. 121). To these two questions, I would add a slightly different, if related, issue: how are media incorporated into everyday communicative and cultural practice?

In this paper, I discuss examples of the kind of activities that may be fruitfully studied as mediated practices, but focus more on the methodological challenges the study of such practices poses. Building on the work of anthropologists, I suggest that a more wholistic perspective requires that we develop ethnographic methodologies that dissolve still-current distinctions between cultural interpretations derived from criticism and from reception study. Yet this imperative to get the whole picture poses significant practical challenges. What kind of methods can help us reach a truly multi-dimensional understanding? Is there still a place in audience studies for more focused analyses of specific texts and genres? I join the other panelists in exploring how the empirical study of media might continue when distinctions between media and culture are ever harder to make."

Cable operators largely maintain the status of First Amendment-protected speakers that conceive the public as individual paying consumers under neoliberal commitments to free markets, though the fraction of set aside public access channels prioritize citizen access, municipal governance and corporate-mandated public subsidy. A commons movement of internet enthusiasts has advocated for the government facilitation of nonproprietary control over software, the physical wires/airwaves, and content so that commerce and voluntary nonmarket social production can bloom. The conference proceedings focused on how each framework constructs idealized cultural citizens and promotes particular socioeconomic structures to maintain them.

The findings indicate that male characters are more likely than female characters to talk about themselves, to make self-enhancing comments, and to use humor when doing so. The employment of at least one woman creator, writer or executive producer is related to the more egalitarian use of self-enhancing and self-effacing comments by female and male characters."

Through a comprehensive survey of the recordings, liner notes, performances, and films of Sun Ra and the 1960s jazz avant-garde and the documents, art, and writings of Black Panther Party members this paper presents an African American uptake of cold war information science and technology. While a number of studies have explored the cultural use of cybernetics and technology in the 1960s among primarily white cultural and political movements, this paper demonstrates how Sun Ra, the jazz avant-garde and members of the Black Panther Party appropriated technologies and made them central to their identities as core components of their fundamentally performative projects to change consciousness in response to the psychological alienation caused by racism and the workings of a technocratic, capitalistic society. As such, their work represents a cultural proto-informational imagining that runs parallel to much of the cybernetic research of these two decades. Yet, the different artifacts they appropriated and contrasting ways in which they redeployed and reconceived technologies reveals competing ideologies and broader conflicts during the 1960s over the meanings of black consciousness, politics, and social change. This paper concludes by suggesting how a re-signification of technologies occurred as they circulated outside of the communities that had access to the science itself."

In his analysis of media societies, he singles out the Italian case as an example of unprecedented concentration (Habermas 2006).

Industry representatives and some policy makers hope that the transition to digital television (scheduled for 2012) will put an end to this situation. Consumers, they argue, will have more choices. Media concentration will naturally disappear: the technology will make the existing duopoly obsolete.

Is this true? Is it true that the abundance of channels will discourage the formation of monopolies? Is it true that more choices will be better? Better for whom? Who will benefit from the digital transition? Who, in the public arena, is taking the time to explain what the digitization process entails, and how it might have any relevance to strengthening participatory democracy? Who has ever really explained digital media aside from quantitative technological output issues framed in broad terms? The paper explores these questions by mapping the history and nature of public debate on the digital transition in Italy.

I rely on primary sources (legislation, interviews with key players in the industry and policy makers, textual analysis of the public service broadcasters coverage of topics related to the digital transition) and on the existing literature.

The current research takes a different approach and focuses on the content of software websites, and evaluates it from a diffusion perspective. Content analyses of 218 software websites reveal significant differences in the application of diffusion theory. Though diffusion and information systems (IS) principles are applied in the design of most software websites, business software sites tend to provide comparatively more image and trialabilty information, while consumer software sites focus more on the softwares compatibility. Moreover, business software sites dedicate a proportionally greater percentage of their site space to providing ease of use and social influence information, while consumer software sites provide more usefulness information. The findings of differences in website content, emphasis, and presentation are unique, and demonstrate the actual application of diffusion theory in the promotion and dissemination of innovations."

This study used an experimental design to examine the effects on HIV-related stigma of a radio program featuring people with HIV, in the setting of rural villages in Malawi. The study design migrated from an individually-randomized, pre- and post-test design with self-recorded responses, conducted in classrooms or churches to a village-randomized, post-test only design with interviewer-recorded responses, conducted on grass mats outside in the middle of the village. This presentation will discuss how these changes occurred along with issues such as translating social science scales to another language, gaining local permission to recruit participants, adjusting to physical characteristics of the study setting, collecting data in low-literacy populations, adapting to surprises in the field, and contending with unexpected power and social status differences between researcher and participant."

It finds that the culture of pairs figure skating, this team, and Gordeeva's memoirs were earmarks of a neutrosemic condition within which fans who held a conservative worldview steeped in patriarchy, piety, and American exceptionalism could derive validation. These fans consequently scrutinized and policed Gordeeva's public widowhood, expecting her to operate within narrow parameters that kept sacrosanct their original modes of identification and, therefore, to remain frozen in time along with her departed, idolized spouse."

Sangho Lee was the first case in Korea, in which the reporting of wiretapping was argued in the courtroom. However, the Korean High Court, rejecting the journalists immunity from liability, gave more value to the right of privacy than to freedom of the press. In contrast, the U.S. Supreme Court protected the journalist, who disclosed secretly and illegally wiretapped telephone conversations, under the shield of the First Amendment. Even if both countries have different laws and legal systems, these conflicting judgments mainly result from how the court understands the role of the media as a watchdog. I argue that the Korean press cannot have more freedom until the Korean court realizes the press watchdog function as an important value in society."

We conducted an exploratory Internet survey (N=942) in order to gather information about what motives people have to play a particular genre of games. Results show that playing because of the competition in the game is least important for people playing RPG and MMORPG, but most important for people playing FPS. For the challenge motive, a reversed pattern was found: for FPS players, challenge is less important than for (MMO)RPG players. Escapism and fantasy are no important reasons to play FPS, at least not compared to people playing action games or (MMO)RPG. Finally, the desire to socialize with others is least important for people playing RPG. Furthermore, this study shows that the importance of these motives are related to game-use characteristics such as the average time people spend on gaming, the period of time they have already played the specific video game, and whether they play in solitude or in the company of others."

However, research has not yet specifically addressed the ways in which these media texts have incorporated homosexual content. The present study seeks to fill this gap in the literature through examination of Details, one of the genres leading publications. By combining a textual analysis of editorial content since 1990 with an examination of how each of the magazines editors has constructed his audience in terms of masculinity and sexual identity, I find that Details has not, in fact, always distanced itself from gay content. Rather, the editors have actually incorporated different discursive constructions of gayness that have, in different capacities, served the magazines commercial interests."

The analysis studied the primary racial minority that has both a U.S.-resident and international component: Asians. It identified 378 Asian models from 8,319 human models on the homepages and admission pages. Genders differed significantly in representing stereotypes of Asians. Asian females appeared more active in interacting with others and more often to be the visual focus than Asian males. On the contrary, Asian males were more likely than Asian females to appear alone, submissive, as a background role and as an action receiver."

I show that through Heidegger?s conceptions of Discourse and Assertions, the assumed ontological categories and distinctions that are commonly applied to gender can be disrupted, or de-naturalized. Through this, Heidegger?s work can seen as raising the possibility of understanding and performatively resisting normative explanations for items such as gender by confronting them for what they really are: ontic social constructs. The importance of this work is two fold: first, it opens the door to re-approach Heidegger?s work in the field of communication through his conception of Discourse, and second, it endeavors to provide a Heideggarian grounding for feminist and queer theorist inquiries into the ontological and social status of gender."

The most popular social network websites in Korea (Cyworld) and the United States (MySpace) were employed. Fifty male and 50 female American profile pages were collected from MySpace, and 50 male and 50 female Korean minihomes were collected from Cyworld. The results show that: (1) gender is not a significant predictor of self-disclosure in social network websites across two cultures. Few gender differences were found for Korean self-disclosure in Cyworld and American self-disclosure in MySpace. (2) Culture was a significant predictor of self-disclosure in social network websites. Americans in MySpace self-disclosed more than Koreans in Cyworld in About Me (Self-description). Koreans had more photos and blog entries than Americans. However, there were no differences for a number of other self-disclosure variables. (3) Few interaction effect of gender and culture were found."

This type of research commonly deals with the media of children's television and books, and until now children's magazines have escaped this critical attention. It is evident that children detect sex-role differences in media and seek to mimic socially constructed and widely accepted gender roles. Therefore it is necessary to look at all forms of childrens media, including magazines, for gender stereotyping. Using a content analysis of four U.S. children's magazines, this research explored the gender of the 1,404 characters and what roles and activities the publications assigned to male vs. female characters. Findings indicate that males are significantly over-represented and stereotypical gender behaviors are prevalent. Across categories such as parenting, working in paid occupations, using tools of production and engaging in strenuous activities, the children's magazines resorted to conventional depictions of masculinity and femininity. This research shows that children's magazines do not differ from other children's media in presenting traditional patterns of gender behavior and maintaining sexist stereotypes."

It also investigates how gendered media use may result in differential voting frequencies and presidential job approval ratings. Evidence shows a markedly differential pattern of media influences on political knowledge, voting frequencies and presidential job approval ratings overall, with stronger influences coming from the news platforms and programs that have more exclusively political content. Lower levels of political knowledge among women reflects their lower levels of using political news media content than do men, but women who do follow news about political figures and events in Washington are even more likely then men to know basic political facts. Women can learn those facts through their exposure to news media, regardless of demographics, marital and parental status, church attendance, and political ideology. This helps to mitigate and potentially reverse the gender gaps resulting from lower levels of media use."

Especially, this study is about the difference between men and women in evaluating others self-presentation styles. The same self-presentation styles might be perceived differently by the gender of presenters and viewers. This study investigated visitors likeability and perceived competence of web-site owners. The results revealed that both male and female visitors had higher likeability of the other gender than the same gender. Besides, as for perceived competence, both men and women perceived the other gender more competent than the same gender, and women perceived the bragging man more competent. According to these results, it is suggested that there are gender differences in evaluating others self-presentation styles in personal web-sites."

Genealogies trace the emergence, transformation, and extinction of organizational forms, which are theoretical constructs applied to the classification and differentiation of populations of organizations. These forms can be viewed as collectively negotiated cognitive frames for various types of organizational identities and behaviors associated with them. The major arenas for this framing process are organizational communities, as they constitute the social environment of organizations. Following the basic tenets of structuration theory (Giddens, 1979) and institutionalism (Scott, 1987), genealogies are conceptualized as communicative artifacts that attests to the essential role of taken-for-granted organizing structures for the evolution of organizational communities. This paper focuses on the transformation of forms and genealogies in the context of coevolutionary processes occurring in a communitys network of populations. Several processes are discussed that are associated with genealogical change within organizational communities: (1) Entrepreneurial recombination, (2) form convergence and overspecialization, (3) network dynamics, and (4) branching as environmentally occasioned opportunity. The paper concludes with exploring the significance of genealogies as longitudinal evidence for the congealment of communicative processes on several levels of sense-making and relating into organizational forms as discursive structures."

The relationship between media consumption and social class among Latinos can be examined with a generational context as language specific media consumption changes from first generation immigrants to third generation immigrants. The specific question being addressed herein is whether language or ethnicity had more impact on Latinos' mobility in terms of educational achievement and occupational prestige. Results presented in this paper imply the importance and impact of the maximization of the accumulation of linguistic capital in order to accelerate the acquisition of educational attainment, which has a relationship with the shift of U.S. Latinos from the consumption of Spanish language media to English language media."

Specifically, this paper draws on literature in linguistics and rhetorical theory to understand why organizations choose to shape post-emergency messages they way they do. In the aftermath of emergency situations, organizational communicators employ discourse genres according to seven possible functions. Examples of post-emergency situations will be used to bridge theory and practice to show what was done retrospectively and, most important, what can be done prospectively."

Results indicate partners in long-distance dating relationships (LDDRs), relative to those in geographically-close dating relationships (GCDRs), engage in more intimacy-focused everyday speech events. Intimacy-focused interaction also comprises a larger proportion of LDDR partners everyday talk. LDDR partners, moreover, were found to dissipate taboo topic and conflict avoidance, as well as positive selective self-presentation, at slower rates throughout courtship. Similarly, LDDR partners appear less likely than GCDR partners to discuss (over time) what relational scholars identify as critical relational issues (e.g., views on marriage, family, and career) for informed relational escalation. We propose many LDDRs persist in a state of suspended partner knowledge acquisition, a kind of uninformed interdependence, whereby knowledge-enhancing talk occurs less frequently, and unfolds less readily over time."

The second aim was to investigate whether and how these uncertainty reduction strategies resulted in social attraction. Drawing on a survey of 704 members of a social networking site, we found that respondents had used active, passive, and interactive strategies to reduce uncertainty about their new acquaintance. Interactive strategies were most effective in reducing uncertainty about the target person. Respondents level of uncertainty about the acquaintance mediated the relationships between the use of interactive uncertainty strategies and perceived similarity on the one hand and social attraction on the other. Finally, respondents perceived valence of the obtained information about the acquaintance moderated the relationship between the level of uncertainty and social attraction."

This paper posits that the appetitive motivation, reflected by a tight linear relation between pleasure and arousal reactions, is a structural characteristic of emotional reactions to commercial advertising. Previous research already confirmed that pleasure and arousal reactions to commercial print ads consistently reflect the appetitive motivation by showing that pleasure and arousal reactions towards a diverse set of print ads, measured by means of the SAM-scale, exhibit extremely high correlations. In the current study participants were exposed to 17 print advertisements and 18 TV commercials from various products and brands. After each exposure, we measured participants' emotional reactions by means of the SAM-scale. Results reveal highly significant positive correlations between pleasure and arousal reactions for both print ads and TV commercials. This study replicates findings from earlier studies and extends it to another type of advertising, TV commercials. These convergent findings for both types of advertising strengthen the view that the appetitive motivation is a general mechanism of commercial advertising."

This essay will argue that apathy and un-involvement may be the most powerful political feats in the contemporary age. For a media-laden landscape criticized for its superficial-ity, there is a seeming surfeit of texts that stress political involvement. How does one cre-ate a politics of apathy in an age when even our most vapid of media texts emphasize par-ticipation? Perhaps a viable alternative for todays voting youth is to simply not: not vote, not blog, not opinionate; in short, simply not participate. And to take this actionand indeed it is an actionin todays world may be the most pressing stance within the American political landscape. To discuss this turn to political inaction I will examine two key texts in the pop culture leading up to the 2004 election: a South Park episode and the feature film Team America: World Police, both created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. These texts represent the simple statement that if one approves of neither candidate in a two-party system, then the most democratic option is to simply not participate. And while Parker and Stone have been highly criticized for sending out anti-democratic messages, they have actually offered what may be the most democratic message ever heard in popu-lar media: anti-mobilization as a viable alternative."

In this paper, I report findings from my participant-observation of a video game design workshop for adolescent girls hosted by the Girl Scouts in Austin, Texas. These findings are part of a larger project about girls and technological literacy. In my analysis, I draw from a situated learning perspective, which sees individual development as influenced by cultural factors A situated approach looks at the context of girls technological learning and asks how girls engagement in cultural practices allow them to take on different types of technological identities, such as computer programmers, Web designers, or videographers. Construction of tech-savvy identities is especially important for understanding gender equality and technological literacy because girls often report that they are disenchanted with the culture of technology. In my analysis of the workshop, I consider the context of girls learning, including how the Girl Scouts created a culture of game design and how girls took on different identities as game designers through their participation. While my analysis is limited to one instance of girls learning video game design, I argue that a situated approach, which looks at the range of ways that girls identify as game designers, can complement available research on gender and video games"

While Summers has since been deposed (to be replaced by a woman), and his position discredited in the media, the fact is that statements like his represent contemporary patriarchal assumptions about gender in the sciences that proliferate across popular culture. In an attempt to consider the symbolic context in which young women come to understand what it means to their futures pursue a particular career path, this study examines mass media discourse about girls and science that have dominated media discussions over the past five years.

The report can be read as a response to recent developments, such as the 7/7 bombings and the awarding of the 2012 Olympic Games, that have added new urgency to defining the global role of a multicultural 21st century London. In this paper, I conduct a discursive analysis of Muslims in London in order to discern how it contributes to existing public deliberation about the future of British national identity, the relationship between the city and the nation-state, and the complicated role of religion in post 9/11 approaches to multiculturalism in the West. My findings show that Muslims in London eschews direct engagement with the complex debates about multiculturalism in Great Britain. Instead, it relies on neo-liberal economic solutions as a central component of managing diversity. Individual economic prosperity is positioned as central to fostering a sense of belonging. Assimilation to the economic norms of neo-liberalism is not presented in the report as concurrent with cultural assimilation. Indeed, Londons success as a world city is described as dependent on its diversity because an emerging global entrepreneurial class requires the languages, skills and connections of a diverse local workforce. Ultimately, the report outlines the perceived economic needs of London and uses this as a justification for calling on the British government to construct national policy that will best serve the needs of this cosmopolitan city."

This study compares 40 Chinese sales emails and 40 English sales emails in direct marketing. These emails were randomly selected from a database of 7,664 sales emails collected from 36 categories of recipients in Hong Kong over a six-month period. Based on a Cross-linguistic Socio-cultural Model proposed by the author, this study attempts to investigate the similarities and differences in the encoding of persuasive messages across the two corpora. It discusses how far the similarities can be attributed to generic considerations, that is, to the contextual configuration of the field, mode, and tenor of the texts. It also examines how far the differences can be attributed to the social and cultural contexts of the texts with regard to the audience, purpose, and content. Depending on the rhetorical goals and viewer-maker relationships that the makers would like to achieve through the texts, and on the social and cultural contexts in which the texts unfold, a sales genre is apt to be adaptive in terms of discourse strategy and textual features as the marketplace experiences not only increased globalization but also increased localization."

This study conducts a content analysis of 317 news articles on globalization between 1996 and 2006 and a discourse analysis of them on their news frames. It finds that economic issues were discussed more often than any other issues, but there was an increase of attention on cultural and civil issues; the U.S. consistently received far more attention than others as important interest to China. A qualitative analysis of functions, themes and actors of globalization helps to explain the patterns in news coverage on the global world. This study demonstrates that a nations domestic interest and local identity was an important determinant of shaping and perceiving of the global world by national media."

Analyzing the most popularly searched terms netizens around the world used in gathering information online, it determines the impact of globalization and cultural imperialism on gendered public interests within the superstructural context of political freedom (politically free, partially free, and not free), socio-economic status (high, medium, and low SES), and cultural differences (masculine, mixed/neutral, and feminine). Most notably, the findings reveal that the cultural difference conditions produced an inverse relationship, with the masculine condition generating significantly more searches for females and the feminine condition generating significantly more searches for males. This, combined with the results related to SES and political freedom, indicates that the condition most likely to be influenced by globalization and cultural imperialism is a feminine, politically free country with high SES."

Through a grounded theory approach, the findings suggest the adoption of a new model when studying international news coverage as it pertains to a specific region."
2008-0556,Global Redefinition of Journalism?: The Influence of Commercialization on Journalists Role Perceptions,"Comparative Research on the Cultures of Journalism: New Studies, Approaches, and Evidence",,,,Paper,Global Redefinition of Journalism?: The Influence of Commercialization on Journalists Role Perceptions,"Comparative Research on the Cultures of Journalism: New Studies, Approaches, and Evidence","Previous research has shown quite considerable differences in the way journalists describe their job and its role in society. Most of these differences can be explained by the historical development of the media, of press freedom and of the professionalization of journalists in a given country. The paper proposes the hypothesis that these differences will decrease and that we will observe a convergence in the professional cultures. In its first part the paper discusses these earlier results on the way journalists perceive their job and make news decisions  including a study by the authors comparing news journalists in five countries in the early nineties. In the second part, the paper will present first results of a repetition of this study in the year 2007. It is assumed that the data will show more similar role perceptions and patterns of news decisions among journalists in modern democracies. The results will be discussed primarily within the framework of how commercial factors in the media themselves and changes in the politics-media relationship have affected these changes."
2008-0557,Global Theatrical Consumption of Hollywood Films: Homogenization and Cultural Determination,Global Issues in Intercultural Communicaton,,,,Paper,Global Theatrical Consumption of Hollywood Films: Homogenization and Cultural Determination,Global Issues in Intercultural Communicaton,"This paper examines the patterns of theatrical selection and consumption of individual Hollywood films by countries or territories worldwide. Drawing on literatures concerning international media flow and media globalization, we hypothesize that world cinematic audiences have acquired increasingly uniform tastes in terms of choosing imported theatrical features, specifically Hollywood films, to watch. That is, the preferences of separate markets over a given set of Hollywood movies become more similar over time overall. It is further posted that a country culturally alike to the US tends to patronize Hollywood titles in a way parallel to the American market. Panel data of film-specific box office revenue receipts in a wide range of countries are gathered for 2002 and 2006 Hollywood releases, respectively, to test the box office consumption homogenization and mediation by cultural relationship."

While eagerly looking for competitive business models, most commercial stations typically rely on HDTV programs during prime time, which are distributed by major networks or syndications. Also, many ambitious trials have been occurring: making a capital pool from local stations or partnering with stations to provide pay-TV services, exploring a cable network model, such as major networks 24/7 news and weather channels, and even leasing spectrum to the third party. Although broadcasters are expected to voluntarily operate under public interest obligations in return for use of the spectrum, the amount of local public affairs programming transmitted on digital channels was insignificant for both commercial and public stations."

Through general film analysis; comparison to other films about higher education and other subjects; and focal exploration of three key episodes, it is shown that the surface, facile interpretation by many reviewers of the film as a condemnation of higher education is premature and insufficiently grounded in the realities of the film's polysemous nature. Likewise, dual reading reveals that the film's purported celebration of rebellious individuality is similarly tenuous."
2008-0560,Government Communication in Fragile Democracies,Exploring Governments' Communication Strategies and Their Implications for Social Impact,,,,Paper,Government Communication in Fragile Democracies,Exploring Governments' Communication Strategies and Their Implications for Social Impact,"The Philippines and Thailand emerged from authoritarian rule within several years of each other and are both considered to have led democratic transitions in Southeast Asia. Both, however, have undergone serious political crises and democratic reversals during the last two years.

In the Philippines, massive protests against corruption led to the ouster of elected President Joseph Ejercito in 2001, disrupting what had been a fairly stable electoral system re-established in 1987. He was succeeded by his vice president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who ran for the presidency herself in 2004. Allegations of election fraud exploded in 2005 with the emergence of secretly recorded telephone conversations between the president and a commissioner from the Commission on Elections in what has been dubbed by the Philippine media as the Gloriagate scandal. The Presidents press office had initially embarked on an aggressive campaign to present the recordings as legitimate conversations between President Arroyo and a staff member at the Philippine senate. With the approach discredited as more information about the recordings surfaced, the campaign to prevent the Philippine media from airing the recordings continued, culminating in libel threats against the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism which had uploaded transcripts of the recordings on its weblog.

In Thailand, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was removed by a military coup in September 2006, following widespread corruption allegations. The military takeover disrupted fifteen years of civilian rule in Thailand. But even during Thaksins administration, media relations between the former prime minister and the Thai press had been strained by public criticisms and legal action initiated by the prime minister against a number of journalists and publications. The most controversial of his attacks was against reporter Supinya Klangnarong, who had published an article in the Thai Post in July 2003 about how the Shin Corporation (then majority-owned by the Shinawatra family) had benefited from government policy. The Shin Corporation filed a 400-million baht libel suit against Klangnarong, which was dismissed by the Thai Criminal Court in March 2006.

In both countries, media remain in private hands and self-regulation remains the norm, despite new restrictions imposed by the Thai military regime in late 2006. The Philippines, in particular, trades on its reputation as a bastion of free and critical journalism in the region. This paper looks at the paradox of liberalized and ""free"" media amidst shrinking political space and eroded civil liberties in these two countries. It will examine the Thai and Philippine governments' use of legal and economic tools to manage image, justify anti-democratic measures and penalize critics and dissenters in the media. It will analyze how the maintenance of a ""free"", commercial media environment is a vital element of government communication strategy in fragile and consolidating democracies."

2008-0562,Graduate Education as Culture Learning: A Research Agenda,Beyond the Classroom: The Social Impact of Intercultural Learning in Higher Education,,,,Paper,Graduate Education as Culture Learning: A Research Agenda,Beyond the Classroom: The Social Impact of Intercultural Learning in Higher Education,"One of the primary goals of graduate education is to transform students into scholars of their discipline. As each discipline has a unique disciplinary culture with distinct norms, values and forms of communication guiding scholarly activity, the process of becoming a scholar involves types of culture learning very similar to those involved in adapting to a new culture overseas. The development of disciplinary communication competence (Spitzberg, 1988; Hammer 1989)  or a lack of it  has a profound impact on the success of graduate students as future scholars, yet very little research has been conducted about how students acquire disciplinary communication competence or how the outcomes of culture learning may be measured in the context of graduate education.
The paper describes a new research agenda for examining the process and outcomes of culture learning in graduate education using a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods in longitudinal studies with graduate students in Canada, and describes how the findings may be used to support the development of disciplinary and cross-disciplinary communication competence in young scholars."

News outlets showing casualties have been accused of antagonizing anti-American sentiments and adding support for the terrorists cause. In this study, video images in television news stories were manipulated to investigate the effects of negative images on recognition memory. Results of a completely within-subjects experiment indicate that graphic negative video in news stories elicit greater attention and physiological arousal. Recognition memory for visual information in the condition including graphic negative images was highest, while audio recognition for this condition was lowest. The results suggest that negative high-intensity video may overload cognitive resources and impact memory for the audio context associated with the images."
2008-0564,Gratification and Disaffection: Understanding Personal Internet Use During Work,Technology in the Workplace,,,,Paper,Gratification and Disaffection: Understanding Personal Internet Use During Work,Technology in the Workplace,"Many contemporary analyses of personal Internet use at work rely on a model of workplace deviance to explain the behavior, concluding that it is primarily motivated by disaffection. Evidence for this approach, however, is weak. This article argues that a uses and gratifications approach, which emphasizes the expected outcomes of Internet use, more effectively explains the behavior. The two approaches are tested using national survey data collected from over 1,000 computer-using workers. Regression analyses show that workplace disaffection factors, such as stress and dissatisfaction, have no significant influence on web surfing or personal email use. In contrast, factors which shape the expected outcomes of personal use, such as generalized positive perception of the Internet, routinized use of computers, job commitment, and computer use restrictions are strong predictors. These results suggest that employees use the Internet for personal purposes at work for many of the same reasons that they use it elsewhere. Theoretical implications are discussed."
2008-0565,Greenwashing: Perceived Information Manipulation in Print Advertisements,High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Advertising,,,,Paper,Greenwashing: Perceived Information Manipulation in Print Advertisements,High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Advertising,This study uses Information Manipulation Theory (IMT) as a framework for understanding peoples evaluations of green advertisements. Participants (N=138) were given either a greened or a non-greened advertisement paired with information describing the company as having either high or low corporate environmental concern or a control condition with no information. Participants then rated the advertisements for adherence to the IMT maxims and for general honesty. Attitudes toward the advertisement and the company were also assessed. When participants perceived adherence to the IMT maxims they had more positive attitudes about the company and advertisement. The results indicated that a green advertisement from a company with high environmental concern is perceived as more honest than an advertisement from a company with low environmental concern. A green advertisement from a company with high environmental concern is viewed more positively than a green advertisement from a company with low environmental concern.

Results demonstrate that heavy viewers of Greys Anatomy perceive this television show to be credible. Perceiving Greys Anatomy to be credible was positively associated with a perception that doctors in general are brave. A positive association emerged between doctor bravery and competence while an indirect effect connected Greys Anatomy credibility with doctor competence as mediated through doctor bravery. Doctor competence was negatively associated with patient non-adherence and positively associated with patient satisfaction. Lastly, patient non-adherence was negatively associated with patient satisfaction. Results are discussed with an emphasis on the role of entertainment programs within the ecological model."

This community originated as a suburban development with white working and middle class homeowners. In the past decade, it has shifted to a neighborhood of predominantly Latino immigrants. The increased diversity of Panorama City is made more interesting by a recent redevelopment plan, which incorporates characteristics of the immigrant community. Considering the powerful anti-immigrant sentiment expressed in the recent attempt at federal immigration legislation, the plan to redevelop Panorama City might suggest Southern California is more welcoming than elsewhere. However, the uncertainty of the plan's implementation leaves no guarantee that immigrants will benefit. The paper assesses the significance of Panorama City's transformation and its redevelopment plan to reveal the complexity of symbolic struggle over the future of contemporary global cities like Los Angeles."

The work of one philosopher in particular seems to dominate the discourse. Jurgen Habermass conception of the public sphere serves as a model that receives both criticism and praise. By first outlining Habermass conceptualization of the public sphere, and then surveying several responses from other thinkers, we can move towards establishing future possibilities for critiquing the exercising of democratic practices."
2008-0569,"Hands on Hips, Smiles on Lips!: Emotion and Identity in Cheerleadings Performance of Spirit",The Gender Politics of Emotion Management in Contemporary Media and Performance,,,,Paper,"Hands on Hips, Smiles on Lips!: Emotion and Identity in Cheerleadings Performance of Spirit",The Gender Politics of Emotion Management in Contemporary Media and Performance,"We trace the practices, performances, and discourses of spirit in cheerleading, based on ethnographic field work with college squads. The institution of cheerleading trains participants to feel, or at least display, the emotion of spirit. This cultivation of emotion does not occur in a cultural vacuum, but rather draws on assumptions and ideologies of how emotion is articulated with different axes of identity, particularly gender, race, and sexuality. We argue that the emotional performance of cheerleading has been denaturalized by the increasing participation of men and people of color. This development leads to the question of whether cheerleading is a pure performance frame, within which everything is play, or whether it is merely a structured, ritualized channeling of emotion that is genuine. The introduction of competition into what used to be solely a sideline, supportive activity is an important factor in the resulting emotional ambiguity of cheerleadings performance of spirit."

In particular, it focuses on the dilution of established brand association networks in happy and sad respondents exposed to (in)congruent sports sponsorship information. Results show that in respondents in a positive mood association networks diluted more after exposure to an incongruent sports sponsorship, whereas in respondents in a negative mood association networks diluted more after exposure to a congruent sports sponsorship. Dilution was assessed  implicitly  by administrating a brand specified word fragment completion task. The results suggest that (1) a positive mood enhances respondents potential to assimilate (moderately) incongruent information, and that (2) such assimilation goes at the cost of the accessibility of established brand associations."
2008-0571,Happy Deal With Fatty Meal: Targeting Strategies in Food Advertisement for Children,High Density: Media Influences on Health,,,,Paper,Happy Deal With Fatty Meal: Targeting Strategies in Food Advertisement for Children,High Density: Media Influences on Health,"A content analysis of 11613 from 6 Swiss, 1 German and 1 Italian station was conducted to investigate advertisers strategies targeted to children in television advertising. The ads were collected over a 6 month period in 2006. To examine whether advertisers use different gratification types as a method of targeting their TV commercials directed at children, gratifications are subdivided in product-related primary gratifications and effect-related secondary gratifications. The secondary gratifications are further regrouped into internal external gratifications. In respect to primary and secondary gratifications, no difference had been found among ads targeted to kids and ads targeted to adults. However, ads for adults employ more taste, internal gratifications like reputation or mental balance, and harmony with friends. Children are promised fun, external gratifications like sport or toys, adventure, and harmony with friends. Most promoted food categories among children are fast food, cereals and candies, all high in sugar or fat. They differ in the use of gratifications: while fast foods point out the gratification harmony with friends, cereals highlight adventure. All in all, if we look at the gratifications weighted by their frequency of broadcasting, the used gratifications are perfectly consistent with the obesity problem: no health claims but a huge amount of promised toys, followed by fun appeals, and harmony with friends."

The present article investigates whether such neglect is warranted, through a questionnaire and in-depth interviews with 32 journalists and editors from the three main Israeli dailies: Yediot Ahronot, Maariv, Haaretz. The findings argue strongly for a third, intermediate category of news  'general news'  as well as for a more rigorous and comprehensive definition of 'hard' news and 'soft' news that are here supplied. These three news categories were then tested on 465 news items of the above dailies which led to the categorization of a new newspaper type, lying somewhere between the elite and populist press. Methodological and substantive ramifications of this addition are discussed."

Hegemonic Masculinity and Neo-Homophobia in Sports Coverage of John Amaechi",Masculinities,"In February 2007, retired NBA player John Amaechi returned to U.S. sports pages when he publicly announced he was gay. Former professional athletes such as Glenn Burke and Billy Bean, who also came out after their playing days were over, cheered Amaechis announcement. Some active NBA players reacted negatively, however, and became part of the news coverage about Amaechi. This study analyzes newspaper columns by prominent sportswriters in the U.S. about Amaechis announcement, focusing on how assumptions about sports and sexuality were embedded in the columns and how the ideology of hegemonic masculinity was able to absorb challenges to the gender order. Textual analysis found that columnists minimized homophobia, individualized its prevalence in mens team sports, and ultimately discredited Amaechi as a player and pioneer. These strategies reflect a form of neo-homophobia, similar to the tactics of new racism, that allowed journalists to reinforce that status quo while simultaneously condemning individuals who expressed overtly homophobic views. These rhetorical strategies rendered Amaechis announcement as having little or no value in addressing homophobia in the sports/media complex."

These included a company-sponsored public advisory group, a governmental task force, and regulatory intervention by the EPA. This ethnographic study spanned more than two years, and involved observation and participant-observation of Ohio Citizen Action organizing, activist meetings, public forums, and task force sessions along with formal and informal interviews with participants. The critical analysis evaluates these forms of participation primarily in terms of their role in achieving organizational changes. It also considers how these different tactics facilitate voice among stakeholders, encourage political involvement, and develop overarching critiques of corporate social responsibility particularly in health and environmental performance."

Grounded in Slaters (1997, 2002b) hedonic processing model, this study examined a popular Korean drama Dae Jang Geum as an incidental entertainment-education intervention embedded with gender equality and Eastern medicine themes. Data were collected from 258 individuals worldwide via a web-based survey. Viewers of the television serial reported significantly higher pro-social attitudinal ratings than non-viewers, but differences varied across gender and cultural groups. Overall, absorption and identification each accounted a significant amount of variance in peoples attitudes toward the two social issues in most cases. Absorption did play an important role in spurring discussions, but whether interpersonal communication would significantly influence peoples attitudes was not clear in this study."

This effort also represents a first look at a distinct form of music videos seen on BETs late-night program, BET Un:Cut. The results from Study I showed that music videos performed by African American artists depict significantly more sexual content and display significantly more background characters in provocative clothing than videos performed by White artists. The results from Study II showed that music videos found on BET Un:Cut might be emblematic of a change in the landscape of music videos. Un:Cut videos, primarily performed by hip-hop and rap artists, contained significantly more sexual content and background characters in provocative clothing than videos found in regular programming on the five major music video channels (MTV, MTV2, BET, CMT, VH-1). A gender bias also emerged in both studies. This content analysis of televised music videos (N = 140) uses a combination of the Social Cognitive Theory, the history of African Americans in the media, past research, and current findings to better understand the ways race, hegemony, and capital pressures contribute to differences in the treatment of gender and sexual content in music videos as well as what those differences might mean for an adolescent audience."

It seems ironic that such images are so closely aligned with the signs and practices of technoculture. This paper addresses this alignment within the theoretical contexts of biopower and technological risk. I take as my starting point the current advertising campaign using pictures of animals to market cell phones and other mobile digital communication devices. To analyse the language of this event is to resituate the rhetoric of the image as a form of triangulation: human, animal, phone. What are the implications of this menage a trois? My paper examines this campaign as a pedagogical event which follows and echoes events like Hurricane Katrina, while conveying paradoxical messages about nature and sescurity as part of a campaign to naturalize the compulsion to connect.

I offer a ""reading"" of this campaign and then reflect on the limits of conventional textual analysis posed by the cultural technologies of risk society. The study of technologically mediated communication needs to elaborate and complicate its perimeters to accommodate the competing challenges of digital waste, cultural anxiety and technological security. Drawing on animal studies, event theory and the concept of risk society, I discuss the conceptual and political challenges to digital cultural studies posed by the environment, and situate my analysis of cell phones and animals in relation to interdisciplinary resources that committed scholars are bringing to understanding and intervening in the changing cultures of nature."

The current study took a unique approach to examining video games. This study looked at social aspects of video game play. Specifically, the current study targeted an area associated with video games that has been long overlooked: helping behavior within the context of video game play. The findings indicated that helping behaviors are present across a number of social situations in which video games are played. Helping behaviors tend to be most common in situations in which a video game player was watching someone else play a game or when another individual was playing the game with him or her. Furthermore, the findings suggested that more experienced video gamers were likely to offer helping behaviors to someone whom they were watching play a video game. Altruism was positively correlated to helping behaviors across video game situations. Video gamers who rated high on cooperation or extraversion were found to receive higher amounts of helping behavior from other individuals during video game play."

Specifically, this study relies on hypotheses derived from the empathic communication model of burnout to examine new methods of increasing caregiver communicative responsiveness. A questionnaire was filled out by 159 caregivers from a moderately sized human services agency that explored the role of self-monitoring and emotional intelligence in enhancing caregiver performance. Results indicate that those caregivers who can control their expressive behavior and manage their moods to maintain a sense of optimism are in a better position to respond emotionally and communicatively to distressed clients. The data also yield a work experience explanation for caregiver emotional response to client distress. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."

Reasons for the MUM effect include self-presentation concerns and a sensitivity to the receivers emotionality. An experiment tested these reasons in the context of interactions between friends and strangers. Undergraduate females (N = 330, 165 dyads) were paired with either a close friend or stranger, and one member of each dyad gave either good or bad news to her partner. Results replicated the MUM effect. Across both levels of closeness good news was shared more rapidly than was bad news. No main effect for closeness was found, nor was any interaction between closeness and news valence. These data were more consistent with a self-presentation explanation. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed."

They may want to develop their own writing skills or share an extracurricular activity with friends, or they may wish to see their names in print. Once involved, high school journalists become socialized into an understanding of the role of journalism within their immediate school setting and, to some extent, they are socialized into an understanding of journalisms role in society at large. But what do they gain from this socialization? Based on in-depth interviews with 15 young people actively engaged in high school journalism at four different schools, this article provides a preliminary report of how young people from differing socio-economic backgrounds define their journalism work in relation to ideals of journalism, citizenship, and the public realm. The article explores the ways in which young people discuss the motivations that make high school journalism a meaningful pursuit for them, concluding that high school journalism provides an excellent source of preparation for engagement in citizenship and public good."

This study examined whether Kools cigarette packaging featuring hip-hop cultural images are as effective as more traditional cigarette packages in positively influencing smoking-related attitudes among both White and Black audiences. An experiment was conducted on 260 Black and White participants who were exposed to either a traditional Kool cigarette package or a non-traditional hip-hop cigarette package featuring a Black or a White character. Ethnic identity was also measured to determine whether strength of ethnic identity could be a defense against tobacco marketing. Results showed Blacks and Whites responded more favorably to hip-hop cigarette packages featuring Black characters than they did cigarette packages featuring White characters. It was also found that Blacks with strong ethnic identity had less favorable attitudes toward the cigarette packages, less favorable attitudes toward smoking, and were less likely to intend to smoke than Blacks with weak ethnic identities."

Specifically, the paper questions traditional concepts used to determine social impact within commercial culture and genuine identity-authenticity, independent, mainstream, consumer, producer-and theorizes new ways to account for practices of cultural production in the contemporary political economy."

Despite the high prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS among African American women, little is known about stigma and risk perception in the context of African American women. In particular, a critical component of African American culture, religion, has received scant scholarly attention. An exploratory study of 112 African American women revealed that their level of stigma was positively associated with their religiosity, after controlling for other demographic, motivational, and media exposure effects. That is, those with high religiosity showed more stigma toward HIV/AIDS. However, level of religiosity was not linked to perceived risk of HIV/AIDS"

Drawing upon the psychoanalytic theory of scopophilia, put forth by feminist film scholar Laura Mulvey, hokum, challenges the idea that the cinematic gaze belongs to the heterosexual-white-male spectator. Using tableaux vivants, archival footage, and other experimental cinematic practices, the piece compels the spectator to ask: What does it mean to look at the black lesbian body?"
2008-0592,Honing the Tools of Journalism Research: Herman and Chomsky Versus Bourdieu at Naspers,"Journalism, Citizens, and the State",,,,Paper,Honing the Tools of Journalism Research: Herman and Chomsky Versus Bourdieu at Naspers,"Journalism, Citizens, and the State","Different approaches to journalism research can often lead to diverging and even conflicting results. In this paper, which enters the debate between critical political economy and cultural studies, findings from an analysis using elements from both theoretical approaches are compared in order to shed light on a current South African journalism research problem: the positioning of Afrikaans language and culture at the international media conglomerate Naspers more than a decade after apartheid ended.
As a pilot research project this paper analyses Afrikaans arts and culture journalism at two of Nasperss oldest and most prominent Afrikaans print publications, Die Burger and Huisgenoot, by using Edward Herman and Noam Chomskys propaganda model (from critical political economy) in conjunction and comparison with concepts from Pierre Bourdieus field theory (from cultural studies) as theoretical framework. Research methods include a qualitative content analysis of the above- mentioned publications (20042005) and corporate publications and literature, as well as unstructured in-depth interviews with managers, editors and journalists.
In the first part of the paper, the propoganda model is adapted and applied to the current South African environment. This includes a reworking of the dated fifth filter  anti-communism  to describe the positioning of the Afrikaner-dominated Naspers vis-à-vis the ANC-led South African government and its nation-building policies. Bourdieus field theory is then introduced and discussed in terms of concepts such as (mutually transferable) cultural and symbolic capital, as well as habitus, which is adapted here to describe the historic content, role and function of Afrikaans in the development of Naspers.
In conclusion, where findings from both approaches are compared, this paper argues that field theory seems to be particularly compatible to models and methods stemming from the critical political economy approach. In terms of the argument of this paper, field theory (although arguably not the foremost example of an approach stemming from cultural studies) thus also provides a way of narrowing the gap between critical political economy and cultural studies."
2008-0593,Hope and Despair: Representations of Europe and Africa in News Coverage of Migration Crisis,Media Spectacles of Race,,,,Paper,Hope and Despair: Representations of Europe and Africa in News Coverage of Migration Crisis,Media Spectacles of Race,"Media coverage of immigration has played an important role in the creation of national imaginary and identity. However, since immigration and asylum policies are increasingly shifting to supranational decision making in the European Union, the issue should also be analyzed from the perspective of Europeanization. What are the old and new ethnic and cultural identities and versions of community that are being constructed in news coverage of African illegal migration to Europe? What types of positions are offered for various social agents?
This paper aims to make sense of the representations and identities that are being constructed in the Finnish news stories of African migration to Europe. The coverage of a Northernmost European newspaper of a Southernmost event offers an opportunity to analyze discourses of Europeanization and identity constructions of Europe and Africa.
Previous research on news of asylum seekers and undocumented migrants stresses frame of illegality. However, a closer textual analysis shows the diversity in news journalism. Illegality is no doubt the most recurrent frame, but the migrants are also framed as victims and as heroes  particularly in reportages made in Africa where the migrants have names and social status compared to the routine news coverage where they are left as non-persons. Divisions are made firstly between poor Africa and rich Europe. Africa is presented dirty and diseased, and since Europe is imagined as the opposite, it is loaded with good qualities. However, Europe is not understood as one entity, but distinctions are made between the organized North and inefficient South."
2008-0594,"Hospice Volunteers: Communicating in Relationships Between Patients, Family Members, Providers, and the Larger Community",Communicating With Healthcare Consumers in Organizational Contexts,,,,Paper,"Hospice Volunteers: Communicating in Relationships Between Patients, Family Members, Providers, and the Larger Community",Communicating With Healthcare Consumers in Organizational Contexts,"Volunteers occupy a unique space in the constellation of health care. They are not considered as full members of a health care organization nor are they outsiders; rather, they serve as system representatives who are guided by their own intrinsic motivations and understanding of their work. In the end-of-life context, many thousands of hours of care are provided each day to patients in their homes, in hospitals, in nursing homes, and residential hospice settings. In many cases, volunteers spend more time with the patient than any other provider in the patient-care team and, for this reason, serve as key intermediaries in communication among the patient, the family, and other team members. At the same time, volunteers may be seen as peripheral to the work of providing clinical care and thus their contributions (while almost universally appreciated by the organization) are undervalued from the medical perspective. Drawing from extended ethnographic and interview-based studies of hospice, this paper describes the role of the volunteer and outlines implications for the effective integration of volunteers into the communication of the hospice organization as well as other settings in which volunteers provide a level of patient care."

This paper focuses on interspecialty communication among doctors and adopts an intergroup theoretical approach to explore effect of intergroup communication on the quality of health care delivery. The data were derived from two sources: inpatient medical records, and in-depth interviews with doctors in a large tertiary hospital. Results show that health professionals have a strong sense of specialty identification which pervades their written and verbal communication. A lack of clarity between specialty groups around responsibility for patient care fosters a negative intergroup climate, driving counteraccommodative intergroup communication which potentiates interspecialty conflict and threatens patient care. We discuss these results in terms of their implications for the implementation of clinical practice improvement initiatives and team based interventions in this setting."

At two different Southwestern Universities in the United States, and through the feminist Roundtable of various ICAs, I have collected data on academic women and their perspectives on success. This is against a very stark backdrop of the discourse of tenure and promotion that seems to constitute our successes. Despite this discourse there is a much broader understanding of success, and also a much more differentiated understanding of the barriers to success. I will have a preliminary analysis of my data and results available for the conference."

There exists gender inequalities or masculine privilege for each of these labor sites. While organizational communication research has focused in-depth on the public site, observations of the private have been limited. Using participant-observation data gathered from 47 families, this study examines their domestic labor process through a communication and masculine frame This study demonstrates how husbands doing masculinity at home creates a social process that maintains the home as a site for predominantly female labor. It finds that more progressive families routinely discuss domestic labor, and as a result are able to recognize, and appreciate, the domestic contribution of their spouses."
2008-0598,How Entertainment-Education Programs Promote Dialogue in Support of Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change Top Papers: Education and Entertainment Media in Development,,,,Paper,How Entertainment-Education Programs Promote Dialogue in Support of Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change Top Papers: Education and Entertainment Media in Development,"Mass media messages often prompt dialogue among listeners or viewers. Such dialogue may be a key vehicle of influence leading to pro-social change. If the dialogue prompted by a mass media program is central to understanding media effects, what forms does this dialogue take, when does it emerge, and how does it influence people to change their thinking and actions? These questions formed the basis of the present investigation, which examined four entertainment-education (E-E) programs in India, Peru, and South Africa, developed with the intention of promoting pro-social change (e.g., gender equality, family planning, etc.). We discovered that stakeholder dialogue between writers/producers of E-E programs, researchers and subject matter specialists, and potential audience members aided script and character development and helped to create realistic storylines. Second, internal dialogue (parasocial interaction) between listeners/viewers and media characters lead to conversations about the educational content of the media program that fueled support for pro-social change. Third, interpersonal dialogue within families, and dialogue at the group level among community members, facilitated discussion of sensitive or taboo subjects in ways that were supportive of change in family dynamics and helped to negotiate the complex dynamics of orchestrating social change activities at the community level. Finally, listeners and viewers of E-E programs confronted powerful forces of resistance as they attempted to change community power dynamics. Despite these difficulties, our findings suggest that synergistic possibilities for social action emerge when E-E broadcasts disseminate pro-social models of behaviors that spark various forms of dialogue among audience members."

The first and second - level agenda building effect was investigated using content analysis about press releases and newspapers. In addition, the function of events by environmental groups in the process of agenda-building was also explored. Results showed that the amount of press releases issued by environmental groups was positively associated with the amount of news stories about the issue. When it came to the attribute level, only a newspaper regarded as liberal was on the same track with the environmental groups. With regard to the effects of event, both newspapers reported more stories about Saemangeum when the environmental groups planned and practiced various demonstrations. Contrary to stories about demonstrations, cultural events were not significantly related to the number of news stories. In sum, this study found that a relationship existed between press releases and media coverage in terms of agenda-building. The results also indicated that the mention of demonstrations in press releases had a significant correlation with favorability of news coverage, even in a conservative newspaper."

Evaluation of Ethical Values and Attitudes of the Professional Field in Germany,"Public Relations and the Practice: Individual, Organization, and Population-Level Perspectives","This paper aims to outline fundamental aspects of the ethics of PR within a theoretical-analytical framework in the first part of the paper. This is achieved on the basis of some major ethical problems and an analysis of potential conflicts that are relevant to PR and which are reflected in different ethical approaches, in particular, individual and organizational ethics or the ethics of responsibility and the ethics of conviction (Max Weber). Problematic ethical issues are defined and structured systematically in a model which distinguishes between different relationships. An overview of the status of research in the German-speaking context on the topic of PR ethics facilitates provisional statements appertaining to the awareness and acceptance of ethical codes in Germany.
Some important results of a recent survey of 2,312 German PR practitioners are presented. This survey was carried out in 2007 and focused on aspects of PR ethics, on the acceptance and the degree of familiarity with ethical guidelines in Germanys professional field of PR practitioners, on the significance of morally induced goals and professional self-understandings or professional identities. It could be shown how important truthfulness is seen for German PR practitioners and which  specifically ethical  reasons are evaluated as problematic for the industry. On the basis of a debate about tie-in deals in Germany that currently reached a level of intensity results about the acceptance and legitimacy of such procedures within the professional sphere are also introduced."

Lynn Spigel, Tara McPherson, Roberta Pearson, Alex Doty, and John Tulloch, among others, have called for cultural studies to re-engage with some of the most sanctified works and practices in our culture, to understand how and why ""high culture"" appeals to its most dedicated consumers, to re-examine canonical texts from theoretical perspectives created for the study of popular culture. Here, I want to use one of my own current projects, Moby Dick Remixed, as a starting point for such a discussion."

Qualitative one-on-one interviews were conducted in New Orleans to gain the perspectives of these journalists. These interviews were analyzed in the context of theories of news production. Two key findings emerged. First, journalists saw the newspaper as an advocate for the city. Second, journalists saw the newspaper as a site of community cohesion and catharsis. These findings suggest that theories about news production and in particular about objectivity should be considered more contextually."

The model specified hypothesized linkages among viewers identification with the victims of disasters, perceived suffering, compassion, and helping behavior. Two hundred and three participants viewed a news video of a disaster and completed a survey regarding their reactions to the news segment. Helping behavior was measured as number of hypothetical raffle tickets surrendered in exchange for monetary donation to a disaster-relief charity. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the emotions of sadness, distress, and empathy comprised a three-factor model of compassion. Results further indicated that perceived suffering and identification with the victims are correlated, however, victim identification, mediated by compassion best predicted helping behavior. Among the composite of empathy, distress, and sadness empathy was the best predictor of helping behavior, which supports an altruistic explanation for helping."

Despite huge investments, however, anti-marijuana messages in the United States do not appear to be working. Clearly, we need to better understand how mass media shape marijuana attitudes and behavior. Critical in that process is the recognition that previous work has focused on individual messages and campaigns, but has largely disregarded the likelihood that effects of anti-marijuana messages depend on the broader media environment in which they operate. To explore links between broad mass media systems and individual marijuana attitudes, this research systematically compares U.S. and Dutch media environments. Previous work has shown that U.S. messages characteristically present strong behavioral directives that emphasize reasons why not to use marijuana (i.e., a one-sided message environment), whereas Dutch marijuana content represents both risks of and reasons for marijuana use (i.e., a two-sided message environment). The present research tests the hypothesis that repeated exposure to marijuana content that is either one-sided (i.e., living in the United States) or two-sided (i.e., living in the Netherlands) systematically affects marijuana attitudes."

Media Structure, Content, and Cognitive Load, and Overload",High Density Session: Information Processing of Media II,"This paper investigates the impact of six dimensions of information on local cognitive load during television viewing. Specifically an experiment is reported in which secondary task reaction times were measured 350 msec. following selected camera changes. In addition, a forced choice recognition measure for the information in the frame immediately following the camera change was measured. This was done to examine the cognitive load of camera changes which introduced from one to six dimensions of information. The information preceding and following the camera changes was compared and coded on the following six dimensions of attention: perspective change, closer, change in object, new to scene, emotion change, and unexpected. Initial results say that increasing the number of dimensions increases reaction times and decreases recognition. Signs of cognitive overload appear at 4-5 dimensions of information."

In the three treatment conditions of accuracy, defense, and impression motives, the respondents changed their attitudes through either the heuristic or the systematic mode, depending on their motives. In particular, the accuracy-motive group used the systematic processing mode, while the impression-motive group employed the heuristic processing mode. The empirical findings highlight the importance of processing motives in better understanding the process of attitude formation and change."

Evaluating the Presidents Capacity to Set the Agenda for the Press Through His State of the Union Address,Media Policy,"A Presidents State of the Union address is a special occasion in his presidency. For almost the entire year, the audience is fragmented, with the news media covering a variety of topics. Yet, on this night, all the major networks, both broadcast and cable, in addition to many radio networks, transmit the Presidents speech live. Barring a national emergency, the speech may be the Presidents largest audience of the year. In addition, the President addresses nearly all members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, top commanders of the military, and members of his cabinet, among many other elites. This is also the one night in the year when the President articulates his vision for the country and gives a progress report of where the country stands on key issues. The major question this paper explores is, to what extent can the President set the agenda for the mainstream press through this speech and in what ways is he limited? When the President proposes and emphasizes an important new policy initiative in his speech  in this paper, a new energy policy -- in what ways, if any, will he set the agenda for the press in terms of what they report on in the weeks and months ahead? Or is the new policy merely reported on the next day and soon forgotten? Does the Presidents framing of an issue influence how the press subsequently frames it or do the news media continue to frame the issue as they did before the speech?"

We proposed a theoretical framework that begins with how adolescents estimate influence of advertising on their parents and friends and then facilitates an examination of how the perceived influence on parents and friends, in turn, influences adolescents own materialistic values. The findings show that exposure to advertising does not have a direct effect on adolescents materialistic values. However, there is an indirect effect of advertising on adolescents materialistic values. This indirect effect is mediated by adolescents perception of advertising influence on their friends but not by adolescents perception of advertising influence on their parents."

The iPhone as the Jesus phone highlights an interesting interaction between technology fans, news media and corporate advertising. It also demonstrates how different groups may interact and appropriate the language and imagery of another to communicate very different meanings and intentions. Intertextuality serves as a valuable framework to specifically unpack how religion was employed as a helpmate to sell technology and reflect on how religious language and imagery may be utilized to communicate both positive and negative aspects of a technology."

Drawing on the work of Bruno Latour and David Stark, and framed by how the First Amendment and Tocqueville describe democratic public infrastructures, it analyzes them in terms of how they assemble people, format them as participants, and distribute agency to them. After having traced the organizational processes that led one of the organizations studied to settle for the predominant form of media bloggingthe centralized way that is so different from the popular imaginary around bloggingthe paper concludes by pointing out how blogging in media organizations is predominantly oriented towards self-expression, conversation, and media-criticism, thereby vindicating some of the hopes expressed for a democratic public infrastructure, but that their architecture and framing makes them introvert and systematically turns those they assemble away from action, thus stymieing other hopes."

Fifty-one participants read 4 news stories dealing with either local or distant health threats while their heart rate and skin conductance were recorded. Results showed that high proximity health threats elicited greater heart rate deceleration than low proximity health threats, indicating greater allocation of automatic resources to encoding the high proximity threats. Recognition data demonstrated that details form high proximity health threats were recognized more accurately than details from low proximity health threats. Proximity didnt significantly affect skin conductance during reading. These results are discussed in terms of Shoemakers hardwired for news hypothesis."

The background of using both the total viewing volume and the genre exposure as measure of exposure to images is studied. Based on the conclusion that both operationalizations have limits a new operationalization is constructed on two cultivation themes: medical characters on television and illness and death on television. These two new exposure measures are based on the respondents individual exposure to types of television programming. Furthermore all types of programming are weighed with the proportion of specific images that is shown in this type of television programs. The proportions are the result of a large scale content analysis performed all television content. Structural equation models are used to compare the different operationalizations. Results show that the new operationalizations are the best measures for predicting cultivation variables of medical characters and illness and death.

Yet, some have argued that the opposite may occur: playing a violent video game may reduce aggressive effects. Until now this cathartic effect for violent video game play has not been empirically demonstrated. The present research attempts to reconcile the predictions of catharsis theory with several opposing theories by taking into account the role of aggressive personality. Study 1 (n = 64) found that violent video game play caused more aggressive affect than did non-violent video game play for those low in trait aggressiveness. Conversely, and in support of catharsis theory, study 1 also found that violent video game play caused less aggressive affect than did non-violent video game play for those high in trait aggressiveness. Study 2 (n = 62) found a similar pattern of effects on aggressive behavioral tendencies."

Arguing that the hyper-commercialization of television continues to increase due a variety of contextual reasons and technological advances that enhance the distinctive televisual style of television, the essay applies content and textual analyses of the 2007 BCS National Championship football broadcast on the U.S. television network Fox, and compares these findings to a similar study conducted on the 1996 national championship broadcast. Results indicate a significant decrease in advertising-free broadcast time as well as an increase in the use of on-screen graphics with commercial iconography. In addition, the broadcast is characterized by the integrated marketing techniques that blur distinctions between content categories. The essay concludes with a discussion of the implications of hypercommercialism of sports and broadcasting for the vibrancy of the public sphere."

Researchers must now judge whether these methods are applicable to study YouTube. How much do the relations between videos on YouTube resemble the hyperlink relationship of websites? My paper provides some preliminary methods for network mapping on YouTube. The paper lays out a methodology for identifying the linkages between videos and posters through comments, playlists, and video responses. These measures seek to understand how strong or weak are the relations between thematically similar videos. In finding these relations, I compare YouTube to other theories of the web. Foot (2004) and Benkler (2006) suggest that the web is composed of smaller, overlapping spheres comprised of websites that share a similar theme or interest. Web spheres better conceptualize social meaning online by focusing on cultural linkages between sites, rather than technical similarities. My paper tests this theory on YouTube by using content analysis and network mapping to identify spheres. By identifying spheres on YouTube, we can begin to better understand the impact of the site in specific cultural contexts."

The women almost invariably diminish the importance of their wartime contributions; a common refrain I hear is I didnt do anything important. Their individual experiences, as revealed during the interviews, belie that assertion. In this paper, I will use the womens words to parse what is meant by this rhetorical move. Do the women really believe they didnt do anything important? If so, why do they find it necessary to participate in the very public process of oral history, placing their names and life stories within the historical record? Considering both the content and the context of the womens words from a feminist pragmatist philosophical base will help explain this seemingly incongruent act. By telling their life stories to another the women refuse to marginalize their experiences, but instead claim their roles in history."

Team-based qualitative analysis of verbatim transcripts from twenty-six in-depth interviews was conducted to determine patients expectations both before and after surgery. Participants included residents from the Houston area who had attended an educational class designed to prepare patients for knee replacement surgery. Following a grounded theory approach, the analysis resulted in thirty-two distinct codes which were organized into twelve families of similar codes. Findings are presented within the framework of Banduras Social Cognitive Theory with emphasis being given to the role of self-efficacy in the recovery process. Specifically, the authors suggest a narrative perspective expands the current understanding of self-efficacy through narrative qualities such as time and sequence, benchmarks and critical events, and the patients own sense of engagement the illness process."
2008-0620,If You Feel It Now You Will Think It Later: Brand Extension Evaluations and Mood Over Time,Advertising Structure and Effects,,,,Paper,If You Feel It Now You Will Think It Later: Brand Extension Evaluations and Mood Over Time,Advertising Structure and Effects,"Three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of mood on consumers evaluations of brand extensions immediately after exposure (study 1) and after a one-week delay (studies 2 and 3). Study 1 revealed that consumers in a positive mood perceived higher brand extension fit and evaluated brand extensions more favorably than did consumers in a negative mood. As hypothesized, mood effects were attributable to differences in processing of the brand extension ad. Studies 2 and 3 showed that differences in initial mood and processing affected judgments made one week later. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

This study examines newspaper coverage in 32 newspapers from 1997-2006 to determine which strategies are being covered and the degree to which those are evidence-based and implemented by colleges. The mix of individual versus environmental strategies was examined based on Social Cognitive Theory. In the 255 articles analyzed, the majority of strategies covered were environmental. The most frequently covered strategy, increasing student knowledge, is individual and not evidence-based. Strategies classified as effective were not frequently covered. Regional differences and changes over time were found."

For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least one in four adults in the U.S. will contract an STD at some point in their lives. Schools in the Chinese cultural society often fail to fulfill studentsâ needs for sex education due to cultural factors. Accordingly, media become a major source for young adults to gain an understanding of STDs.
This study examines college studentsâ perceptions of STDs and their use the internet as an information source to search for STD information. Surveys were conducted in three different regions to collect data about studentsâ browsing habits, their differences in perceiving the risk of STDs, and their assessment of and satisfaction with the information they acquired online. Results of this study provide suggestions for health programs that use the internet as a tool for STD prevention."
2008-0623,Image Repair in a Food Health Crisis,Top Student Papers in Public Relations,,,,Paper,Image Repair in a Food Health Crisis,Top Student Papers in Public Relations,"This study focuses on finding the most effective message strategies in a food crisis context to increase attitude and behavior intention toward both the product category in general and the specific companys product. A laboratory experiment was conducted with 299 undergraduates, and an accidental contamination of the largest milk-producing dairy in the United States was designed for a crisis situation.
The key finding is that even though message strategies did not change general attitude and behavior intention toward drinking milk, they helped to increase attitude and behavior intention toward drinking Brand A Milk. Furthermore, in this accident situation, contrary to situation crisis communication theory (SCCT) and previous research, denial or combination messages with denial were more successful than diminish or repair cluster strategies. The results imply that the way a company tailors its messages during such a crisis will be very important especially for the company."

The analysis is grounded in an ethnographically inspired qualitative study of approximately fifty individual interviews and ten reception interviews. The analysis focuses upon three aspects of moral discourses of media use in everyday life; 1. Values connected to media use in everyday life. Three separated types of values are identified and discussed 2. The analysis also discusses everyday hierarchies that separate different kinds of media and forces people to create both practical and discursive strategies to feel more at ease with the moral dimensions of media use. 3. The moral discourses of media use in an everyday context is variable and changes with the spatial context. This study has an ambition to reach a broad understanding of everyday media use and its moral dimension, and discusses its spatiality from that point of view."

I conclude that the scholarly discourse about Soviet journalism is nothing less than a mirror for the entire field of Sovietology, or Communism research, which was a very particular kind of knowledge production within the U.S.-led social science in the 20th century."

It shows how the interplay between the technical configurations of mobile technology and users perception of technical attributes in particular social environments influences the actual use pattern of mobile services. It then reviews how the commercial environment and market arrangement in the U.S. mobile game industry shape the content and user base of mobile games. It is argued that researchers should investigate how technical configurations and market-driven business models shape the usability and usefulness of mobile technology at both societal and user levels before they frame research questions on the possible effects of the use of the technology. And the study of such effects should be based also on the social features embedded in mobile services that fulfill different functions and form different relationships. Such a balanced understanding should facilitate the imagination of new scenarios in mobile gaming that could inform the design and implementation of next generation technical and commercial systems of mobile entertainment services."

This paper examines how convergence with new media has shaped Bollywoods imagination of Non-Resident Indian (NRI) audiences. Drawing on interviews conducted with an array of executives, content producers, and film journalists at prominent dot-com companies such as Rediff.com and Indiafm.com, and trade and press coverage of Bollywoods convergence with the Internet, I demonstrate how dot-com companies imagined and represented themselves as uniquely positioned to reconfigure a geographically vast yet poorly defined overseas territory into a well-defined NRI audience segment. I argue that dotcom companies emerged as indispensable knowledge brokers who could mediate a range of relationships between Bollywood and overseas audiences.
I begin by detailing how dot-com companies situated themselves in relation to a discourse of corporatization and capitalized on three interlocking shifts in Bollywood:
(a) the growing importance of marketing and market research, (b) the normalization of the overseas territory as Bollywoods route to the global, and (c) structural changes in the domain of film distribution, particularly where the overseas territory was concerned. Following this, I analyze how dot-com companies role as knowledge brokers was defined. Drawing on the work of cultural geographers and media industry scholars, I explain how the production and flow of Bollywood content on the Internet is a direct function of dot-com companies proximity to Bollywood and dot-com professionals ability to forge connections and establish themselves within existing social networks in Bombay. This analysis of the spatial logics of convergence between Bollywood and new media leads to an examination of how the dynamics of content-creation on the Internet shapes relationships between Bollywood and overseas audiences.

The result of this combination is McEmpire, or McDonaldization in the age of Empire. We argue that New Belgium, a Colorado-based craft brewery, communicates the myth of localism, or anti-globalization, in the age of Empire, and that this communicated myth produces a catalyst for the multitudes resistance of Empire. Ritzers modernist model of McDonaldization did not allow people or companies to resist the McDonaldization phenomenon, but as the shift from modernity to postmodernity takes place, new networks of power are being developed that both establish the conditions of Empire and allow for resistance against Empire. These new networks allow alt-commerce companies, like New Belgium, to compete with the powerful global corporations by selling the myth of anti-globalization. New Belgium, we argue, uses the current transitional period between modernity and postmodernity to construct a nostalgic myth of the pre-postmodern condition. This myth creates the catalyst for resistance against the globalization of the food industry."

These racial polarizations came about with the splintered of the multiracial Peoples Progressive Party (PPP), which was divided into the PPP Jaganite faction and the PPP Burhamite faction. The first faction is primarily composed of East Indiandescendants of indentured laborers from India, and the latter is made out Africandescendants of African slaves. The paper will also explore the counter narrativesracial conciliation, cultural exchange, cultural promotion, and collaboration for national development that are also evident in Guyanese broadcasting in New York. Over the years, New York has emerged as the largest center of the Guyanese diaspora. Guyanese of East Indian heritage tend to live in Queens. Guyanese of African heritage tend to live in Brooklyn. New York has also emerged as the center of Guyanese broadcasting in North America."

It draws on Jurgen Habermas theories to propose that immigrant women in rural areas seek out opportunities for dialogic communication through mainstream social networks that are often based on models of instrumental or strategic communication. These interactions lead, arguably, to the closing of spaces for immigrant participation in the public sphere."

While the subjects of such studies have been primarily educated, relatively affluent, urban youth in developed countries, scant attention has been paid to mobile phone use by their more economically or socially marginalized peers. This research attempts to intervene in this gap and is the result of 10 months of ethnographic fieldwork that explored how young rural-to-urban migrants working in the low-level service sector in Beijing engage with mobile phones to navigate their identity and autonomy in the city. Beijings rural-to-urban migrants are an extremely marginalized population as a result of cultural and structural factors. A mobile phone allows them to enhance their social and economic capital, but can also be used by employers as tools for surveillance. This research thus addresses the potentially positive and negative aspects of mobile technologies."

An experiment was conducted to examine how image restoration strategy (corrective action, mortification, denial, reduce offensiveness, or evade responsibility) would impact the variables listed above.

We used a unique Australian population survey data series in which smoking prevalence was measured using consistent methodology each month from July 1995 to December 2006 (average n=2,700 adults/month). Time series analysis assessed the effect on smoking prevalence of televised anti-smoking advertising (using gross audience rating points/month[GRPs]), cigarette costliness, monthly sales of pharmaceutical smoking cessation products, and restaurant smoke-free laws. Exposing the population to televised anti-smoking ads an average of almost four times per month (390 GRPs) led to a 0.3 percentage point reduction in smoking prevalence (95%CI: 0.56 - 0.03) two months later. Increasing the costliness of a pack of cigarettes by 0.03% of gross average weekly earnings also led to a 0.3 percentage point reduction in prevalence (95% CI: 0.49 - 0.11). Both effects decayed over time if the interventions were not sustained. Other tobacco policies had no detectable effect on smoking prevalence. We conclude that public health-sponsored mass media campaigns broadcast at sufficient levels of exposure at regular intervals, and increases in the real price of cigarettes, are critical for reducing population smoking prevalence."

However, the effectiveness of government public relations strategies is not only contingent upon public relations expertise but also upon legitimacy of Chinese government perceived by journalists. This study finds out that Chinese government public relations efforts have been helpful in raising the number of attributions to Chinese government sources in U.S. media coverage of China, but do not improve the image of China in U.S. media coverage and the valence of China in American public opinion."

Students watched one of four versions of a televised debate. In each, while the speaking debater appeared on the main screen, subscreens displayed her nonspeaking opponents background nonverbal behavior. In one version, the non-speaking debater displayed a neutral expression during her opponents speech, while in the other three she nonverbally displayed occasional disagreement, nearly constant disagreement, or both agreement and disagreement. After viewing the debates, students rated the debaters likeability. Analysis indicated that background nonverbal behavior influenced audience perceptions of the nonverbal communicator but not of the speaking debater. These results and their implications are discussed."

Although antismoking PSAs have been established as effective, empirical evidence as to what message features enhance effectiveness is necessary in order to improve PSA value. This study examines how death appeals, argument strength, and message sensation value affect smokers judgments of antismoking PSAs. This study utilizes secondary data of 383 smokers ratings of perceived effectiveness, perceived susceptibility, transportation, and fear on a set of 32 ads from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions archive. The results indicate that ads that depict death or death-related illness receive higher ratings than ads without death appeals, that death is linked with high argument strength, and that message sensation value tends to intensify the difference between death and non-death PSAs. Implications for future message design and message design studies are discussed."

North Carolina now employs more migrant farmworkers than any other state. From 1999 to 2004, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee led a boycott of Mt. Olive Pickle Company, based in North Carolina. The workers ultimately gained the first migrant farmworker union in U.S. history and formed the largest union in North Carolinas history.
This Critical Discourse Analysis examines the coverage of the boycott in the Raleigh News & Observer and two Latino newspapers to identify whether the Latino press could articulate an alternative discourse. The N&O relied on the Souths deeply entrenched antiunion script to construct Mt. Olive as an innocent victim of a politically-motivated union. In contrast, the Latino newspapers gave FLOC a voice to assert their struggle as a just and noble one  an example of the powerless fighting for what they rightly deserved. This case can serve minority media as an example of how to model future struggles that they may encounter and contribute to bringing about economic and social justice."

While such experiments can only establish short-term effects, this article investigates to what extent youngsters' foreign language skills benefit from their consumption of media on the long term. In an empirical study, the self-reported use of three English language media by 374 Flemish pupils in the last year of primary education was compared with their scores on oral proficiency tests of English vocabulary, grammar, and Dutch-English and English-Dutch translation skills. The analyses of variance reveal that pupils who frequently watch subtitled English television programs and movies perform significantly better on all four tests. Listening to English language music and playing English language video games, however, do not appear to influence English proficiency."

It argues that states with modest military and economic resources can become important actors in the international system by forming partnerships with domestic and international constituencies who are committed to such attractive goals as peace, welfare, health, education, human rights, and sustainable development. Public relations is posited as a function that builds and manages relationships, and, therefore, is critical for strong diplomatic partnerships."

However so far the empirical findings of any major interactivity in online news has been scarce. This paper evaluates how interactive features evolve during a three-year period on four Swedish news sites. The findings suggest that over time; a bigger percentage of news items has interactivity, that more interactivity features are introduced, that the interactivity in and around news increasingly gives users an enhanced role. This paper concludes that even if interactivity has had a slow start the tendency is that there is a steady rise in what can be considered as interactive news."

Secondly, these filmic discourses depict the middle classes as alienated or aimless and suggest that they need to awaken  a resurgence that can be brought about by the youthful energy of middle class youth  and find themselves in the nationalist cause. Moreover, these representations suggest that the middle classes need to build new resistive strategies that would enable them to stake claim within the realm of electoral politics."

Past research has shown that adherence to these directives depends on individual beliefs and circumstances. This paper presents new research about the effects of community factors on adherence. Using a multi-level perspective in assessing factors related to adherence, this study expands the focus from individual to household and community factors. Qualitative household and key informant interviews were conducted and stratified by neighborhood characteristics to assess the effects of community factors. This study examined response to public health directives during a hypothetical intentional release of pneumonic plague in St. Louis, Missouri.

This study incorporated both uses and gratifications and structural variables to explain audience exposure to television and also compared predictors of exposure between college students and non-student adults. Overall, seven variables--ritualistic motivations, exposure to the Internet, audience availability, cost of multi-channel service, age, instrumental motivations, and gendercombined to explain 30.3% of the variance in exposure to television. Among students, use of the Internet was the strongest influence among seven significant variables, while ritualistic motivations served as the strongest predictor among non-students. The results suggest that both individual and structural factors influence audience exposure to television and that no single theoretical construct explains the complexities that determine exposure to television."

Using a large sample of dating adults, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the existence of the five styles. Women scored higher on all flirting styles except for the playful style, and older women were less traditional than younger ones. Older daters were more sincere, more inhibited and less playful than younger daters, but middle-aged daters were more physical than either younger or older daters. Styles correlated predictably with extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness and Self-Monitoring. Predictive validity was demonstrated by linking styles to courtship initiation behaviors and past relationship experiences. Daters employing the physical, sincere, and playful styles reported more success in flirting, and physical and sincere styles corresponded with increased physical chemistry, the development of an important relationship, emotional connection and with a faster pace of relational escalation."

I am interested in the conflicting rationales that the European Parliament and the Commission use in their respective draft directives. The central point of reference in the Commissions draft is the Single market, with Europeans being addressed as consumers. In contrast, at the heart of the Parliaments concept of media regulation is a European public sphere composed of European citizens. My analysis suggests that the Parliaments emphasis on the medias role for democracy will be considerably diminished compared to earlier directives. Furthermore, this paper aims to illustrate that research on EU media policy needs to focus more on ideological struggles AMONG different EU institutions in contrast to conceptualizing the EU as ONE entity opposed to others, such as civil society or lobby groups."

It also shows that audiences almost universally demand Indianess; audiences expect to see at least some traditional clothing and performances, displays of familial emotion, and, most importantly, Indian values upheld and reinforced. This ethnography shows that Bollywood audiences living in India neither succumb to nor absolutely reject either Westernization or their local knowledges, but that they expect a mutual adaptation of disparate world-views. I read such a reciprocity between the influences of globalization and the forces of local culture in responses to Bollywood films as an instance of dynamic hybridity, of glocalization, which can help us better understand how Indian audiences live through, articulate, and construct intersections of the global and local."

Growing concern has been voiced over the potential role that media play in promoting such perceptions, but no empirical investigations have been undertaken to address the concern. Using the influence of presumed influence model, this study examined if and how television contributes toward promoting the perceived benefits of a tan. A survey of white college students (160 males, 205 females) indicates that exposure to tanned images on television is linked to their perceived benefits of a tan, as mediated by perceived influence of television on tan benefit perceptions among peers. Perceived tan benefit perceptions among female rather than male peers showed a stronger association with womens perceived benefits of a tan.

Drawing upon Streets (2002, 2003) ecological perspective, the researchers explore several individual, provider-patient interaction, and system perceptions and expectations, test a model of hospital system satisfaction, and discuss the implications of the SEM analysis. Specifically, it was hypothesized that individuals who rated themselves as having high self-efficacy would report higher levels of patient satisfaction than individuals who reported lower self-efficacy scores. In addition, it was hypothesized that patient perceptions of physician affirming nonverbal behavior and patient expectations as well as the amount of time the patient must wait will likely affect physician credibility. Lastly, patient perceptions of physician credibility and patient satisfaction will ultimately affect overall patient satisfaction with the health system. The results indicate partial support for the model. The implications of the findings for Streets model and the limitations of the current study are discussed."

To explore the information needs and source use of breast, prostate, and colon cancer patients using data from a population-based sample.
Methods. A sample was drawn from the list of cancer patients with breast, prostate, or colon cancer who had been reported to the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry in 2005. A total of 2010 patients completed a mail survey; respective response rates were 68%, 64%, and 61%.
Results. Averaging across cancers, more than 80% of patients reported seeking information about their cancer. The most common source cited was treating doctors; however, only a third of patients sought exclusively from doctors or other health professionals. Nearly 60% of patients who sought information reported seeking from at least one medical, interpersonal, and mediated source. Seventy-eight percent of patients reported coming across information about their cancer when they were not actively looking for it; respondents reported seeking information in an average of three distinct topic categories, including treatment options and chances of survival or cure. Colon cancer patients reported less active as well as less passive information acquisition than breast and prostate cancer patients. On average, younger and better educated patients tended to acquire more information. Racial/ethnic and gender differences were minimal.
Conclusion. Cancer patients have myriad information needs and engage with a range of sources to satisfy these needs. It is important for physicians to recognize the complexity of patients information landscapes and guide patients toward reliable and appropriate sources of cancer information. Findings are strengthened by the studys representative character."

Processing demands requiring flexibility, complexity, and abstractness may exceed preferred thresholds and moderate informational reception, perception, and/or adjustment. Recently, the scope of the variable has been widened to embrace receptivity of information gathered through information technology (IRAT-IT). Following a year-long effort to promote instructional technology, 73 faculty members completed the IRAT-IT and reported on their goals for and uses of classroom technology. IRAT-IT scores of faculty volunteering for technology training were associated with higher technology expectations, more technology use, greater perceptions of technology difficulties, and the perception that technology would reduce instructors out-of-class work, but increase students total technology use. Results are discussed in terms of curriculum development and difficulties adopting information technologies."

2008-0656,"Information Processing, Trust, and Perception of Environmental Cancer Risk",News Coverage of Cancer and Science: Content and Effects,,,,Paper,"Information Processing, Trust, and Perception of Environmental Cancer Risk",News Coverage of Cancer and Science: Content and Effects,"This paper examines how institutional trust affects the way people process information and perceive risk. Data come from a study of risk perception in the circumstance of US state health department investigations of suspected cancer clusters, with thirty cases examined (n = 1,111). Trust is assessed for three information sources: state health departments, civic groups, and industries involved in each case. Higher trust for the state directly predicts lower risk perception, while high trust for civic groups predicts greater risk perception. Perceiving high trust for industry and state -- and low trust for civic groups -- promotes heuristic processing, which in turn predicts lower risk perception. Alternately, perceiving industry to have low trust and civic groups to have high trust promotes greater systematic processing, which consistently leads to perception of greater risk. Almost all of the effect of industry trust on risk is expressed indirectly."

Specifically, it compared the newspaper coverage to the press releases and investigated the role of the releases as information subsidies in the coverage. The findings suggested that the releases were not used as information subsidies in the way the newspapers reported the disasters because there was no connection between information provided by press releases and stories covered by newspapers."
2008-0658,"In Media We Trust? New Demands on Responsibility, Responsiveness, and Accountability","Public Participation, Public Expectations",,,,Paper,"In Media We Trust? New Demands on Responsibility, Responsiveness, and Accountability","Public Participation, Public Expectations","In many liberal democracies, politicians, government officials, segments of the public and academics talk and worry about the increasing power of the media. They challenge the responsibility of their professional behaviour, accusing media institutions and journalists of having too much power without being accountable for their actions. The latter are believed to be neglecting their fundamental principles of providing reliable, complete and balanced information. Incidents in which the reliability of media and journalists was put into question, have dented trust in public media institutions and led to a re-emergence of the discussion about the responsibility of the media.
In this debate explicitly and implicitly four interrelated concepts are central: trust, responsibility, responsiveness and accountability. Drawing on examples from mainly the UK and the Netherlands, this paper analyzes how the tensions in the relationship between politics, the public and the media have not only changed the meaning of these concepts, but also put new demands on them. Responsibility, accountability and responsiveness have become the prerequisites for restoring trust. At the same time there is a potential tension between responsibility and accountability  over the limits of media freedom  and between responsibility and responsiveness  over the borderline between the professional responsibility and autonomy of the journalist and his civic duty to listen to what the public wants. These conceptual and relational shifts eventually question the effect on current media governance structures."

Using a highly participative approach, we provide some findings from this research interpreted from a complex responsive processes perspective. Our focus is on innovation as everyday communicative action between organizational actors, and particularly the relevance of power, identity and leadership in such activity.
Our findings suggest that innovation processes can be seen as shifting communicative patterning processes at the same time upholding and changing patterns of power relating and identity formation. These processes are influenced by different people with their own intentions and plans and are not controllable by any one individual or group in the organization.
The management of such processes is therefore not about being in control, but rather the intentional participation in everyday conversations where the unpredictable self-organizing emergence of individual and collective meaning/identity is influenced."

The measure for this research covers positive expectations from drug use, refusal self-efficacy, social perceptions/orms about drug use, and negative expectations/risks of drug use. Data are collected from 100 youth ages 14 -16, every week for 50 weeks per year, allowing for an annual sample size of 5000 diverse teens. Analysis using a time-series approach found that awareness of campaign advertising was significantly related to lower positive expectations and more accurate social perceptions and norms about teen drug use. Awareness of advertising was also linked to increased negative expectations about drug use. These findings provide tentative support for the effectiveness of the campaign in driving attitudes and beliefs linked to lower youth drug use."
2008-0661,In Search of the African American Audience,Race and the Media,,,,Paper,In Search of the African American Audience,Race and the Media,"As with any community, African-Americans have their fair share of problems. Perhaps more than other American communities, African-Americans struggle with violent crime in their neighborhoods, unplanned pregnancies, and financial insolvency that results from poor education and inadequate wealth management. There are many factors that contribute to these challenges, but one that has not been adequately explored is television.

Empirical research in the field of communication has demonstrated a positive relationship between television exposure and violent behavior, pre-adolescent and early adolescent sexual activity, materialism, and poor academic performance. Research has also shown that African-Americans view more television than any other demographic group. Using data from the 1972 through 2006 General Social Survey, this paper seeks to explain African-American experiences with television. This research finds that both traditional explanations of black television use specifically and general models of television viewing behavior do not adequately account for African-American television experiences. This suggests that primary research designed for this cause should be conducted."

Think of this as a person cutting across a lawn, finally becoming a sidewalk used by others. The significance is both in the ways it sustains and recruits subject positions and the ways it directs reproduction and reconstruction of individuals interiors, identities, norms, knowledge, and future value-directed moves. Often understanding this process is obscured by dualism and psychologisms that separate subject and object. Our studies, including a nuclear fusion lab and a genetic clinic, suggest that relational unities are organized as discursive systems (including material arrangements, practices, and language) that articulate (conjoin and present) the unity. Considerable competition exists among institutionalizations. I will discuss discursive struggles, how advantage and disadvantage occur, where institutions form out of reciprocal contestation, and where discursive closure prevails."

The panelist frames her project in the work of feminist sociologist Dorothy E. Smith, who encourages researchers to use everyday experiences as the basis for investigation, rather than focusing on abstract social theory developed externally to the situation. Working within that tradition--and against a backdrop of national reports that demonstrate basic inequities of promotion and pay for U.S. academic womenthe project explores womens reports of their struggles to succeed in university systems. The study focuses on womens talk about translocal structures that form the ruling relations of our academic institutional discourse. Although these structures include tenure and promotion, the panelist concludes that they are not central to the stories that women tell about academic success. Not only does this presentation explore these narratives of struggle and success in the academic arena, it also examines the position of the ethnographer, herself an academic woman."
2008-0665,Institutional Legitimacy and Russian News: Case Studies of Four Regional Newspapers,"Journalism, Citizens, and the State",,,,Paper,Institutional Legitimacy and Russian News: Case Studies of Four Regional Newspapers,"Journalism, Citizens, and the State","This paper applies new institutionalism theory to a study of journalism practice in four regional Russian newspaper newsrooms. Of particular interest is the way newspapers respond to the dual environments of an increasingly centralized government authority and a weak, but lingering environment of Westernization. Data gathered through interviews and newsroom observations revealed that in accordance with the new institutionalism thesis, these organizations seek public legitimacy through conformity with government authority and traditional Russian culture, and they tend to model themselves after newspapers they perceive to be successful. This was the case regardless of type of ownership (private and state). Papers adopt loose coupling between their practices and external realities, ducking concrete feedback and evaluation (and the publicity of such evaluation) in order to more easily maintain a sanctioned, legitimated appearance. This was especially true of state-owned papers. By de-emphasizing breaking public affairs events and emphasizing creative commentary, papers more easily craft content so that it avoids controversy and conforms to the authoritarian climate. And by avoiding self-evaluation and fudging readership numbers, papers can more easily appear legitimate. Low professional motivation among individual journalists helps enable such duplicity. All papers tended to adopt a veneer of Western journalism, for example, embracing the visual design of news pages. Privately owned papers did engage in some Western-style reporting, often struggling to gain exclusive information before rivals. But respondents at all papers rejected the idea of Western journalism, perceiving it as sensationalized and devoid of morals and artistic worth."

I argue against several tenets and propositions of that theory, and elaborate and amend it re the intersection of institutions and organizations. Specifically, I urge increasing the emphasis placed on second-order organizations (e.g., the Federal Reserve, the SEC, the stock exchanges for the economy) as media of institutional influence. Second, I urge replacing their first two propositions with the proposition that A communicative dialectic of distanciation and appropriation sustains institutions and aligns organizations with them. Third, I would amend Proposition 3 to include both formal communication and cognition-coordinating practices. Last, I show how all four constitutive processes of McPhee and Zaug (cf. McPhee and Iverson, 2006) involve institutions in varying ways."

We examine technological integration using distributed cognition. In the framework of Hutchins (1995), founder of this approach, human action is based on the ability of human beings to integrate the various elements of the context in which they function. This relationship between humans and their context in the accomplishment of daily activities is the object of this study. Context is defined as a set of structures of material or social origin, from which individuals draw the information necessary to undertake action. More specifically, in our case study conducted in a Canadian hospital, we draw on Hutchins conceptual framework to investigate the introduction of a new technology that was implemented to integrate accounting information . We see how the material structure of this new technological artifact changes the relationship between workers and their contexts as well as how they conduct work activities."

These forms are often referred to as multimedia features, interactive infographics or audio slideshows, just to name some examples. In a qualitative study with 21 subjects we combined eye-tracking, think aloud procedures and interviews to analyze the reception of these complex forms of presentation. Within an action oriented theoretical framework, media reception is therefore defined as a process of interaction between recipients and media, determined by features of the media as well as by characteristics of recipients. Findings indicate the importance of visuals for the sequence of reception: Salient visual features like colour or size determine non-intentional as well as intentional phases of reception and thus have an important effect on multimodal information integration. But visually mediated information is also decisive for orientation and navigation within hypertextual structures. The study could show the impact different visual systems have on these tasks. With the integration of time-dependent visual content like video, animations or automated slideshows the dimension of content control has to be considered as well. User interaction with these forms is also to a high degree driven by the visual features of control systems."

We review discussions about the division and proposed integrations among mass and interpersonal communication research. We argue that recent technologies fostering the intersection of virtual communities and mass messages through Web 2.0 applications offer particular salience to information from anonymous peers, and that a distinctive aspect of many new technologies is that they simultaneously present multiple types of influence sourcesmass, peer, and/or interpersonalin a manner that redefines or re-orders influence processes. We further develop a framework in which interpersonal motivations which computer-mediated communication make especially potent drive mass media information sampling and information processing. New types of public messaging may also be best investigated by stringent analyses of composers interpersonal functional goals."

The author describes aspects of the news environment during the United States Civil War, 1861-1864. The creation and reception of news was characterized by skepticism and collaboration, and social practices around personal correspondence blurred the boundaries between journalist and audience. Getting the news was a collective enterprise, a matter of pooling, comparing, and evaluating knowledge. The mosaic of sources from which a news item drew was written into its text, showing the reader by what channels the information was gained. The reader was expected to continue the process of evaluating a journalists account through his or her own sources of information. The paper concludes with remarks on the use of historical methods for theorizing the impact of new media."

Results indicated that among low rationals but not highs, increasing emotional intensity was associated with increasing apprehension. Probative salience did not interact with rationality but did interact with emotional intensity and experientiality. Among high experientials in the high emotional intensity condition, increased probative salience decreased reported apprehension. Probative salience also interacted significantly with emotional intensity and rationality on probative value judgments. Among low rationals, increases in emotional intensity potentiated increases in probative value. Among high rationals under high probative salience, emotional intensity was inversely related to judged probative value, while under low intensity conditions, the relationship was nullified. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for non-linear, dynamical approaches to message processing."

Circuit judges deal more with rendering judgment of the law in applied cases, whereas magistrates are concentrated on the philosophy and interpretation of the law. Preliminary analysis has found that there are no significant differences in overall accuracy judgment (across groups), but significant differences in the overall application of deception detection in cases, as well as correlation differences (within groups) in the estimation of ones ability to detect deceit and overall accuracy (magistrates) and years of experience in the position with overall accuracy (circuit judges). Findings are germane to the current body of applied nonverbal communication research due to both the access to high-held and influential positions of law as well as the international context from which the data have been collected. Future research in this area seeks to examine more juxtapose judges internationally."

The study also examined the influence of news intensity and communicative potency on viewer agreement with policy positions. To test these assumptions, a mixed subjects 2 x 2 x 4 factorial design experiment was conducted. Analyses revealed that high intensity North Korean crisis news elicited more aversive emotional responses in viewers than low intensity news segments, consistent with previous research on domestic crises. With regards to policy support, participants expressed the most agreement with President Bushs North Korean policy after exposure to high potency presidential reactions following low intensity images of the threat. There was also a main effect of news intensity on policy agreement, with low intensity news eliciting more agreement with the administration's North Korean policy than high intensity depictions of the nuclear threat."

This transformation requires that the participants change in ways that significantly affect their worldview. Internationalizing on-campus curriculum is an intentional approach to designing courses that can be provocative and engender resistance because it challenges deep-seated attitudes, beliefs, and values, and requires faculty to employ pedagogical practices that promote self-discovery, self-reflection, and personal transformation.
This paper provides a conceptual framework for internationalizing courses, and examples of strategies, tools, and exercises to help participants progress systematically through the learning process. Two theoretical models guided the sequencing, content, and process: Bennetts (1993) Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity, and a transformational learning model (Taylor (1989; ODonovan (2004). The Intercultural Development Inventory  (Bennett & Hammer, 1999) was used to assist faculty in their own personal development."

Survey data were collected following the theoretical guidelines and research objectives established in the comparative study that also includes France, Sweden and Quebec (Canada). Our study will help understand the leading role of Universities in the development of Internet in Mexico. National researchers point to some gaps between private and public universities, as well as between public universities with a strong technological foundation and others who are trying to build it. The main differences seem to relate to institutional planning, the geographical area, the student population, the political assumptions and strategies to obtain resources and incorporate a digital culture.

Based on the nature of the Internet as a hypertext medium and on an infinite amount of health information accessible on the Web, this study focuses on Internet engagement as a potential moderator between Internet use and general health knowledge. To this end, this study uses a U.S. nationally representative survey of adults aged 40-70 years. The results show that those with have high levels of Internet engagement learn more health information from the Internet than low Internet engagers. The implications of these findings for future research on the Internet and health knowledge gap research are discussed."

Although research has found that, once Internet access is achieved, there are no ethnic differences in Internet health information seeking, it is unclear if there are ethnic differences in patient-provider communication about Internet health information. To help fill this gap in the literature, the National Cancer Institutes Health Information National Trends Survey 2005 was analyzed with Stata 9. Two sets of logistic regression analyses were conducted, one for a sub-sample of Internet users (N=3,244) and one for a sub-sample of Internet users who are first-generation immigrants (n=563). The dependent variable was patient-provider communication about Internet health information, which assessed whether survey participants had discussed online health information with a health care provider. The predictor variables included: trust of health care provider, trust of online health information, Internet use, health care coverage, frequency of visits to health care provider, health status, and demographics. Among all Internet users, Whites had higher levels of patient-provider communication about Internet health information than Blacks and Asians. Similarly, among Internet users who are immigrants, Whites had higher levels of patient-provider communication about Internet health information than Blacks and Asians. While the digital divide is narrowing in terms of Internet access, racial differences in patient-provider communication about Internet health information may undermine the potential benefits of the information age."

The data collection methods included in-depth interviews, participant observations and documentary reviews.
The results of this study show that the diffusion and usage of the Internet in rural areas are conditioned by the interplay of structural factors and individual differences. For the three rural places examined in this study, the diffusion of the Internet tends to be a result of organizational intervention. The purposes behind the change agencies in introducing the Internet greatly determine the ways of Internet access, the extension efforts taken to encourage farmers to adopt the technology, and the direction of social changes that may take place as a result of the Internet.
One of the major findings is that Internet adoption and usage tend to be closely associated with local farming and business activities. The information needs, conditioned by the modes of production, influence farmers information seeking behaviours, which in turn affect adoption inclination and intensive usage.
The explorative experiences of the three rural places indicate that in order to provide sustainable rural Internet services, local governments need to create effective partnership with private organizations and telecommunication operators and solicit participation from the rural elites."
2008-0683,Internet Radio and Radical Democratic Citizenship: The Experience of Hong Kong,Using Online Media for Civic Engagement,,,,Paper,Internet Radio and Radical Democratic Citizenship: The Experience of Hong Kong,Using Online Media for Civic Engagement,"This paper is a case study of the Peoples Radio of Hong Kong (PRHK), which was established in 2004 in response to strong social demand for democracy in 2003 when half a million of Hong Kong people taking to the streets protesting against the government and striving for democratic reform. For a few years until mid-2007, PRHK was the most established citizens Internet radio in Hong Kong. Drawing upon Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffes theory of radical democratic citizenship that conceives citizens as political subjects and advocates citizen participation in challenging existing hegemony, this study conceptualizes PRHK as citizens media that embodies radial democratic citizenship. This conception is particularly important in the case of Hong Kong, where the rights of people, the core element of citizenship, are restricted, for example, in setting up their own non-commercial FM radio stations, and where democratic system is underdeveloped.
This paper examines how radical democratic citizenship was enacted in PRHKs media operation in the technological setting of Internet. The finding is that, PRHK has brought forth new social and technological settings for radio broadcasting. Its medium characteristics as Internet radio, together with its corresponding broadcasting regulations, have generated a new broadcasting/ political space that enabled the easier production and circulation of those counter-hegemonic discourses largely denied in traditional mainstream media. Finally, this paper discusses the future development of Internet radio in Hong Kong and hence suggests the direction for theorization on the relationship between radical democratic citizenship and Internet radio."

As a genre, reality TV has established itself worldwide and continuously develops new subgenres which lead to continuous audience demands. This cross-cultural study analyzes viewer enjoyment of reality television, and identification with reality television characters, within groups of viewers. To analyze how viewers use group discussion to actively interpret media texts, and the role of emotions and interpersonal communication in audience viewing, 5 groups of American viewers and 5 groups of German viewers were asked to view similar episodes of ""American Idol"" and ""Deutschland sucht den Superstar"" (Germany seeks the Superstar), respectively. Group discussion was videotaped and transcripts were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, revealing interpretive themes and frameworks  such as upward and downward social comparison  used to understand media texts. Through this, the impact of conversations on emotional media effects is elucidated."

Based on an integrative research methodology, the study utilizes both quantitative and qualitative data obtained from in-depth interviews with 51 well-educated foreign-born residents of a university town in a south-central state in the United States. The analysis offers detailed and specific information as to the extent of, and ways in which, foreign-born individuals communicate interpersonally with native-born individuals (host interpersonal communication) as well as with co-ethnic/co-national individuals (ethnic interpersonal communication). In addition, the analysis provides empirical support for the theoretical relationship predicted in Kims (2001) theory between host interpersonal communication and two key indicators of adaptive changes, functional fitness and psychological health."

We hypothesized that an intervention designed to promote HIV prevention behaviors can increase interpersonal discussion, which in turn can improve health outcomes. A 2 (community: contrast, treatment) × 2 (assessment: before, after) quasi-experimental was conducted in Malawi to test the hypothesis. The study took place in the context of an existing micro-credit program that lends money to Malawian women to run small-scale businesses in order to make them financially independent. The contrast arm received only the micro-credit training, whereas the treatment arm received both the micro-credit and HIV prevention training. Findings indicated that the intervention resulted in significant increases in discussion about HIV, knowledge about HIV, and self-efficacy to use condoms. Increases in discussion, in turn, resulted in enhancements in knowledge, self-efficacy, and behavioral intention. Findings are discussed in the context of interpersonal discussion-based interventions."
2008-0687,Interpersonal Media Use in Face-Threatening Situations and the Construct of Information Control,Computer-Mediated Communication and the Use of Media in Interpersonal Communication,,,,Paper,Interpersonal Media Use in Face-Threatening Situations and the Construct of Information Control,Computer-Mediated Communication and the Use of Media in Interpersonal Communication,"The presentation of self is a consistent concern in everyday life. This concern becomes more salient for individuals as they come upon face-threatening situations (embarrassment or imposition for self or other). When one is expecting face-threats for an upcoming interaction, one decision to be made is whether to engage one's communication partner in person or using some other interpersonal medium. Previous research suggests that individuals will prefer to use mediated channels when face-threats are present. The present paper conceptualizes the concept of information control as a perceived interpersonal media dimension that serves to more deeply explain the relationship between face-threats and media preference. The results of this study show that one of the dimensions of information control, competence information control, significantly predicted preference for using all of the analyzed interpersonal media in face-threatening situations. The second dimension, privacy information control, had predictive power depending the degrees of face-threats present. Implications are discussed for the information control concept and for the nature of media selection in these situations."

Political expertise and group composition are examined as central factors in determining amount and content of contributions in conversations about news. Based on findings in small group research, we assume that persons with higher political expertise contribute more information to discussions in a heterogeneous group composition regarding political expertise while those with lower expertise do so in a homogeneous composition. We further predict a positive relation of amount of issue-relevant contributions and learning outcome - based upon the concept of elaboration. In order to detect conversation patterns, dyadic conversations about a TV-news report were analyzed and participants post-conversation knowledge about the topic was assessed. The results of the quasi-experimental study reveal some support for our assumptions. We therefore conclude that interpersonal conversation about media news may be one further important reason for the development of knowledge-gaps."

At first blush, these stories sound like progress, but they still leave the center unchallenged. Based on critical whiteness studies literature and extensive ethnographies with journalists at two daily newspapers, this paper looks at journalists problematic view of diversity and the long-term implications of many white journalists inability to see their own whiteness or to even begin to engage the question: What does it mean to be white. It also poses a new picture of a good diversity story  one where it is the outside looking in rather than the inside looking out, coverage that aims not to expand the center but to interrogate, question, and challenge the center."

A critical part of this social reality involves daily negotiation and performance of multiple identitiesa Pakistani, an American, a Muslim, a female, and others. The purpose of this paper is to document and analyze the types of identities that young Muslim Americans highlight and perform in their discursive practices and interactions, and to explore if, and how, these multiple identities interact and overlap. Based on ethnographic observations and interviews, this study employs discourse analysis and the notion of intersectionality to bring to the foreground a complex nature of young Muslim Americans identities, and hopes to contribute to further dismantlement of the essentializing approach to identity."
2008-0691,In the Interest of Full Disclosure: Transparency at The New York Times,Journalism Ethics,,,,Paper,In the Interest of Full Disclosure: Transparency at The New York Times,Journalism Ethics,"Calls for greater transparency in journalism seem to share the notion that it is a key component in building public trust. Last year, The New York Times launched Talk to the Newsroom, an online question-and-answer forum, as part of an effort to preserve the newspapers credibility. This study uses textual analysis to examine how transparency plays a role in the interaction between readers and editors in Talk to the Newsroom. It finds that readers wanted to learn about the processes and judgments behind the Times decisions, but editors responses were guarded. Editors displayed great candor when describing newsroom procedures but were less likely to engage in discussion about news judgment and motives."

While the most important goal is to persuade students to reduce their alcohol consumption, a secondary goal is to identify, and persuade them to use, protective behaviors that reduce the likelihood of harm from heavy drinking. This research endeavor was designed to augment the standard list of 9 protective behaviors that are identified on the National Health College Assessment (NCHA) instrument that is often employed by researchers and health practitioners. Forty-three separate protective behaviors were listed in response to an open ended question. Their relationship to harm and one possible higher order scheme of dimensions are offered here, as is a discussion of the findings"

This construction of whiteness also marked the beginning of the construction of identity politics as white Europeans conquered and colonized the rest of the world. While media theorists have contested these deeply established constructions on socio, cultural and structural levels, what calls for attention is the economic hegemony that whiteness carries as its ultimate colonial legacy. To use Rosi Braidotti's phrase, ""the master narrative"" in the twenty first century is the neo liberal rhetoric set in place by colonialism and imperialism. The ""whiteness"" of today is about more than race. It is about class, the market, capitalism and property. It is about Western materialism and Western media. It is about Western media having infiltrated and inculcated the global market with the capitalist center of whiteness."
2008-0694,In the Mood to Face the Facts: Positive Mood Promotes Systematic Processing of Self-Threatening Information,The Best of Information Systems,,,,Paper,In the Mood to Face the Facts: Positive Mood Promotes Systematic Processing of Self-Threatening Information,The Best of Information Systems,"Two experiments tested the hypothesis that a positive mood can increase attendance to, and systematic processing of threatening health information, particularly when the information is self-relevant. In Study 1, a positive mood increased differentiation between strong and weak arguments in a threatening health message about RSI only for participants who had received false feedback regarding their high vulnerability to RSI. Mood had no effects under conditions of low vulnerability. In Study 2, a positive mood speeded up responses to smoking-related illness words  compared with neutral words - for smokers who had just read a threatening health message about smoking. The authors conclude that fostering a positive mood may promote attendance to and systematic processing of information that threatens the self, and hence contribute to the success of health campaigns targeted at individuals who are vulnerable to specific health risks."

To a certain degree, they therefore must adapt to the purposive logic of power and money. This study analyzes how nonprofit organizational communications respond to such tensions using a nationwide survey of editors-in-chief responsible for magazines from nonprofit organizations in Switzerland as the empirical basis. The magazines often function as steering tools, following the logic of power, whereas the danger of being colonized by the economic logic is less prominent. The results indicate that big and professionalized organizations in particular tend to cut their roots to civil society and the lifeworlds of their members."
2008-0696,Introduction: Untold Stories of Childrens Media Engagement Around the World,Globalisation: The Next Generation,,,,Paper,Introduction: Untold Stories of Childrens Media Engagement Around the World,Globalisation: The Next Generation,"In order to complement, and in some ways challenge, the dominant English language research tradition regarding children and media, the authors have sought studies of childrens media culture in other parts of the world, revealing stories too rarely told in English language circles. Childrens enthusiastic welcome for global media imports in a small northern country such as Greenland, for instance, differ from the ambivalence regarding traditional ways of life expressed by rural girls in India faced with similar media contents. Meanwhile, for Arab youth, transnational media further both cultural hybridisation and individualisation, but also undermines the scope for indiginious cultural production.
Bringing together insights from such diverse cultures is not easy. We address some of the challenges arguing that, while cultural studies, as an approach, has played the greatest role in providing an alternative to individualistic accounts of responses to (single) media, the issues of power central to transnational media flows demand also attention to the political economy of childrens media as this intersects with national traditions of state and family regulation of childrens everyday lives. Moreover, we suggest that studies of childrens complex media cultures offer important new perspectives on media research precisely because the generational dimension invites contextualised and multi-sited approaches.

The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the demographic variables that predict attitudes toward same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians. Political ideology and attendance at religious services emerged as the strongest predictors. However, a close examination of the two issues shows that there were important differences between them. These differences may aid gay rights advocates in crafting media campaigns designed to increase support for same-sex marriage."
2008-0698,Investigating the Boomerang Effect in Anti-Aggression Media Literacy Interventions,Examining Media Effects in Children,,,,Paper,Investigating the Boomerang Effect in Anti-Aggression Media Literacy Interventions,Examining Media Effects in Children,"Two studies advance research on the boomerang effect in response to an anti-aggression media literacy intervention. Study 1 investigated the effectiveness of an intervention designed to reduce the negative effects of viewing media violence  measured as self-reported willingness to use aggression. Children in 4th or 5th grade (N=152) were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control group. Results indicated that children in one of the treatment groups reported an increase in willingness to use aggression -- a boomerang effect. Study 2 investigated this finding by testing a psychological reactance versus media priming explanation. The results of a 2 x 2 factorial experiment provide evidence that children (N= 128) may process unintended, anti-social, elements of an intervention program at the expense of those designed to produce the intended, pro-social, effect. Specifically, children who were exposed to a media literacy intervention with violent media clips as examples reported an increase in willingness to use aggression, while children who did not view the violent clips did not exhibit this boomerang effect. This boomerang effect is explained by media priming, and is not likely due to psychological reactance. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed."

A 3 (mediation type) by 2 (grade) by 2 (ethnicity) experiment revealed that the results of prior work can be replicated among Caucasian children but not among African American children. Future work is encouraged to study non-Caucasian children to increase mediation researchs theoretical scope and ability to address the needs of a larger, more diverse population."

The current pilot study used a 2 (message source) x 3 (message concept) design to expose women (N=59) to one of three message concepts (e.g., understanding normal mammary gland development, limiting exposure to chemicals, & adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors) with a physician or a researcher as its source. Women then completed a post-test survey designed to assess message and source perceptions, knowledge, attitude, behavioral intentions, and demographic information. Results from regression analyses indicate that direct appeals to mothers with daughters increase behavioral intentions to seek more information about breast cancer prevention and communication with family members and doctors. Implications of these preliminary results for further message construction designed to target mothers are discussed."

Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the hypothesized three-factor oblique model of celebrity involvement represented an acceptable fit of the structure of data and was superior to two alternative models. Post hoc analyses based on modification indices revealed a revised three-factor oblique model of celebrity involvement that was a good fit to the data. Limitations of this study and directions for future research are discussed."

This paper describes a community theater project involving, separately, Garífuna youth and men who have sex with men (MSM) to address HIV/AIDS in those populations in Honduras. This paper describes the intervention workshops with theater specialists in which community members learned basic theater skills and the plays the groups scripted about issues related to HIV/AIDS. Group members performed the plays in their communities, followed by audience discussion about the issues raised. Additional members were trained to conduct pre- and post-event panel interviews with randomly selected audience members in six Garífuna communities (N=101) and three cities with an audience of MSM (N=102) to evaluate the impact of participatory community theater on HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes, risk perception, self-efficacy and behavioral intention. Among both Garífuna youth and MSM there were significant changes in number of ways mentioned to prevent HIV transmission, knowledge of where to get HIV testing, condom knowledge, and behavioral intentions. There were no significant changes in perceived risk or sexual self-efficacy. Participatory community theater may be an effective means of involving vulnerable populations in HIV prevention."

In 2007 the issue peaked following the release of the fourth report from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), a board of climate experts established by the World Meteorological Organization and United Nations Environmental Programme.

While the first IPCC report was published in 1991, only this fourth report caught the full attention of media all over the world, which often employed highly emotional language. Why was this? This paper claims that the coverage of climate change follows a certain issue-attention cycle, which is not caused by the nature of the reported object  be it climate or scientific reports on climate  but by extrinsic factors, such as journalistic practices. Over time these extrinsic factors have converted climate change from a scientific issue into a grand narration in the media."

Such organizations aim to provide both financial assistance (e.g., negotiating with creditors to reduce interest rates and/or accept lower monthly payments) and/or personal finance education designed to teach consumers how to avoid future debt (e.g. budgeting and credit literacy). Although the benefits provided by these organizations can be real, the counseling that they offer and the messages that they deliver often fail to address individuals root psychological causes of indebtedness. The current study uses Galileo theory and method to determine the underlying attitude structures of consumers seeking to change their spending behaviors and consequently develop effective messages to produce significant change in those structures, and in the corresponding spending behaviors."

Specifically, psychological predispositions are used to identify what makes the production of an ironic message likely. Reasons for endorsing and suppressing ironic messages are discussed based on individuals goals in a situation. The importance of common ground between individuals during ironic message productions is also discussed. Results include (a) suppression of ironic messages due to concern for other and self, (b) need for mutual understanding of an attitude for ironic messages to be understood as ironic, (c) endorsing ironic messages is designed to inflict harm to others. A theory of irony as a specific instance of relational maintenance is also offered."

However, few studies have been found to examine the utilization of interactive functions by Chinese websites to facilitate online discussion of civil issues and the quality of online public deliberation. With the concept of the public sphere as its theoretical framework, the current study aims to advance this research line of inquiry by conducting a content analysis of two discussion forums, Zhengwu Luntan and Dayoo Forum, respectively on the Guangdong provincial e-government portal site and the Dayoo.com, a website affiliated with Guangzhou Daily, to grasp both the potential and limitations of the Internet in fostering civic engagement.
The question addressed in this study, with special attention to dialogic qualities of discussion content to see deliberative processes within Web users, is whether there would be empirical evidence that could substantiate the emergence of a public sphere mediated through the Internet in China. Several key variables stand out as direct measures, such as the quantity of posts and participants, topicality, rationality of argumentation and discussion (justification, complexity and civility), and responsiveness and homogeneity of discussion. Findings suggest that discussions in the Dayoo Forum tended to be more deliberative than in the Zhengwu Luntan. A political public sphere in Chinese cyberspace seems to be emerging at the incipient stage. However it is far away from being mature in terms of the complexity of dialogue and the exposure to disagreement."

Womens Political Commentary in Traditional and New Media Spaces,Politics & Gender in the Age of Interactive Mass Media,"Voters could elect the countrys first female president in 2008. Already, a record number of women hold office in the U.S. Congress. And yet, even as women rise to power in American politics, there remains in traditional media an alarming lack of womens voices in political commentary (Overholser, 2002; Pollitt, 2005). And when they have professed their political opinions in cyberspace, some women have been trivialized and harassed (Greer, 2007; Harp & Tremayne, 2006).

This content analysis considers womens political commentary in mainstream U.S. print and broadcast news, and on the Internet. It asks to what extent are womens voices represented in political policy commentary? On what issues do they comment and how do they discuss those issues in ways that may be different from their male counterparts? And importantly, who are they talking to  has new technology allowed women to widen their sphere of political influence or are they preaching to the choir?"

As part of this campaign, fans of the band engage in an interactive alternate reality game through online message boards. Year Zero diffuses its messages through parasocial interaction as its participants exchange ideas through an online environment. This use of the Internet gratifies social and psychological needs as participants engage in discussions, post artwork and discuss ideas. A qualitative content analysis was conducted to define themes and understand how fans interact with Year Zero. It was found that through this medium, users have created a political environment of fans engaged in activism. Users share ideas through Internet tools which enhance their experience and diffuse the educational messages of Year Zero."

However, the fundamental question whether framing effects vary depending on the issue at stake has not been addressed. Based on two experimental studies (total N=1821), this article investigates the extent to which framing effects differ in magnitude as well as process, depending on how important an issue is. The studies show that a high importance issue yields marginal effects and a low importance issue large effects. This moderating function of issue importance operates both at the contextual and at the individual level. The implications for future framing effects research are discussed."
2008-0710,Issue Ownership Dynamics: How Political Parties Claim and Maintain Issues Through Media Appearances,Agenda Setting,,,,Paper,Issue Ownership Dynamics: How Political Parties Claim and Maintain Issues Through Media Appearances,Agenda Setting,"Drawing on a large-scale online experiment embedded in an electoral survey in Belgium, the paper sets out to test whether issue ownership is, rather than a stable condition, a dynamic process that can be manipulated by an experimental stimulus. 5,000 respondents are confronted with an embedded fake TV-news item in which the five leaders of the main Belgian parties expose their parties stance on six issues. We find that issue ownership is a dynamic process and that news exposure leads to significant shifts in issue ownership. Especially on issues that are not owned by any party, a strong communicative performance by the party leader can make a difference. But even on issues that are owned by other parties, parties can gain by communicating about them. So, the paper establishes that media may have a more profound impact on agenda-setting and priming by not only activating existing issue-ownerships but also affecting the creation of issue ownerships in the first place."

The Interactive Effects of Political Affiliation and Processing Strategy,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media I,,,,Extended Abstract,Is Televisions Mean World Mean Only for Conservatives? The Interactive Effects of Political Affiliation and Processing Strategy,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media I,"According to cultivation theory, heavy television viewers make social reality judgments more aligned with the televised reality than the actual world to a greater degree than do light viewers. Models by L. J. Shrum (2001) and M. A. Shapiro and A. Lang (1991) provide insight about psychological processes underlying these effects. We conducted two studies in an attempt to replicate and extend data. Results indicated that when asked to concentrate on providing accurate social reality estimates, participants with better remote memory should also provide more accurate responses, as they can distinguish between sources of social reality information (i.e., television and the real world). Although we failed to replicate the results, we found that participants political affiliation strongly impacted social reality estimates. When trying hard, conservatives increases already high crime estimates whereas liberals lowered already low crime estimates. Given that the original data were drawn from a population that skewed liberal, and our failed replication data were drawn from a population that skewed conservative, this may account for the discrepant data. We are replicating the experiment with a national sample in an Internet-based study to verify that the effects of political affiliation hold among a heterogeneous audience."

Toward Gaze Aversion in Deception,Deception and Trustworthiness,"Do people show different eye behaviors when they are speaking in their second language compared with when they are speaking in their native language? How about eye behaviors when people tell a lie in their second language, compared with when telling a lie in their native language? The present study was designed to explore whether eye behaviors are influenced by the language used in a deception context. Using a high-stake paradigm, we examine differences in eye aversion between native language and second language speakers in four different stages (i.e., thinking, listening, speaking, and post-response). Second, eye aversion as an indicator of deception is examined with respect to different first language groups. Using the EMAC (Eye Movement Action Coding) developed by the researchers, eye movements were measured. The results showed that eye aversion occurred more frequently in the thinking stage across all other stages. However, there were no significant differences in eye aversion between the native and second language speaking groups. Interestingly, results showed that liars were less inclined towards gaze aversion than truth-tellers. The findings of the study indicate that even if obvious gaze aversion is part of physiologically voluntary efforts to reduce cognitive overload when people face difficult tasks, gaze aversion also can be influenced by various other factors, such as individuals personality, language fluency, individuals willingness to control their emotions, and social/cultural behaviors."
2008-0714,Is Thin Really In? A Longitudinal Analysis of Disordered Eating and College Peer and Media Norms,Whats the Norm: Examining Social Influences in Health Behavior,,,,Paper,Is Thin Really In? A Longitudinal Analysis of Disordered Eating and College Peer and Media Norms,Whats the Norm: Examining Social Influences in Health Behavior,"Weight-related behaviors are a significant problem on college campus where anywhere from 22% to 64% of female college students report engaging in bulimic or anorexic behavior that does not meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis. To date, little is known about how sociocultural factors, such as peer norms and media influence, impact disordered eating and related outcomes. The purpose of this paper was to explore how changes in media and peer influence during the freshmen year in college might impact key variables related to disordered eating, notably weight esteem and drive for thinness. We further explored the relationship between media influence and peer norms in relation to these same outcomes. Among our sample of college freshmen (n=182), females (n=103) increased in their consumption of media, their social comparison to media, and their perceptions that thinness was important among peers. These increases predicted a lower weight esteem and higher drive for thinness at post-test. Membership in a sorority predicted lower body esteem, greater drive for thinness, and increases in media social comparison and peer thinness norms. Partial support was found for the mediating role of both media social comparison and peer thinness norms on weight esteem and drive for thinness. This research represents an important first step in identifying how sociocultural influences related to disordered eating may change as a function of the college environment and elucidates how media influence and social norms may function together to produce changes in body esteem, drive for thinness, and disordered eating."

An Examination of the Effects of Depth and Mode of Information Delivery in Entertainment Media,Advances in Media Enjoyment,,,,Paper,Is Watching Others Self-Disclose Enjoyable? An Examination of the Effects of Depth and Mode of Information Delivery in Entertainment Media,Advances in Media Enjoyment,"One of the ways in which relationships develop and become more intimate is through the exchange of personal feelings, thoughts, beliefs, and desires. If self-disclosure is conceptualized as a means through which closeness or familiarity is produced between partners (under the premise that the disclosure is not negative), can such a response be attributable to mediated forms of self-disclosure between a viewer and character on television? The present study empirically tests the effects of two dimensions of self-disclosure―depth (private vs. public information) and mode of information delivery (character-to-viewer vs. character-to-character vs. narrator-to-viewer). Findings support the prediction that a viewers overall enjoyment of witnessing the disclosure of a characters personal information, identification, and transportation are functions of depth and mode of information delivery. Further, results suggest the important role of character address in heightening audience engagement. Implications for the similarity of interpersonal and mediated relationships, societal expectations of privacy, effective entertainment formats, and online self-disclosure are discussed."

Time-biased media are heavy and durable, and are therefore predisposed to endure and help empires expand over time rather than across distances. Space-biased media are light and portable, can therefore be transported across great distance, and are therefore predisposed to help empires orchestrate centralized control over wide dominion. According to this distinction, digital media are clearly space-biased and support a global empire in the here and now. This paper seeks to examine the digitization of information (including text, images, audio, and video), and the existence of the Internet, with respect to the implications of this space-bias, and especially with respect to the question of what empire or empires it might support and extend, and to what ends."

The reality and perspective,Comparing Media Systems: Beyond Western Europe and North America,,,,Paper,Italianization (or mediterraneanization) of the polish media systems. The reality and perspective,Comparing Media Systems: Beyond Western Europe and North America,"The Polish media system has many features of the polarized pluralist model presented by Mancini and Hallin (2004). The system is characterized by a small circulation of daily newspapers and central position of electronic media. The media, above all the press, is marked by a strong focus on political life, an external pluralism and a tradition of commentary oriented journalism. Instrumentalization of public broadcasting media by the government and political parties is visible. Professionalism of journalism is lower than in a democratic corporatist or a liberal model. The relationships of media and political elites are characterized by particularly conflicts over the autonomy of journalism. The state plays a great role as an owner of public radio and television and it controls the private broadcast media by regulations and a limitation of licenses. The Polish media organizations, as in another countries in this region of the Europe, act under a strong external pressures. A political pressure is visible as a politization of media content. An economic pressure results in a strong commercialization of media market."

Participants (N = 331) completed a measure of cognitive complexity, which provided an assessment of processing ability, and responded to either a mildly or moderately severe problem, which manipulated processing motivation; they subsequently evaluated the helpfulness of comforting messages that varied in person centeredness. Consistent with predictions, message evaluations were moderated by the ability and motivation factors, as well as by the interaction between these factors. Further, a peripheral feature of the situation, sex of helper, moderated message evaluations for mildly severe problems but not moderately severe problems. Finally, the extent to which participants thought about the problem situation was found to mediate the effects of the ability and motivation factors on message evaluations."

The paper first introduces the topic of reality television, and tries to account for its recent success. Drawing on theories of the Cultural Studies tradition and Feminist analyses of popular culture, the paper explores the ways in which ""Supernanny"" taps into and expresses the larger cultural conflicts which its viewers are having around their own family arrangements. While ""Supernanny"" itself ends up by offering individualistic solutions to the dilemmas wrought by recent changes in family and work arrangements, the larger question of what kinds of societal supports need to be made available to struggling families is not full addressed. The paper ends by raising the question of to what extent these popular cultural discourses surrounding post-modern families can really resolve the contemporary dilemmas for families, and whether their true value lies in naming the conflict, whereas the larger solution needs to be constructed through open debates and putting real ""family values"" back onto national agendas."

Preliminary conclusions reveal that accounts offered to describe recent violent events varied depending on the abuser's reported locus of control. Additionally, apparent relationships were revealed in the words (cognitive and affective) abusers used in describing their most recent violent episode. Results from the LIWC data indicate that there were several significant correlations between words used by abusers in describing the triggers and accounts relating to a recent violent event. Because this study concentrated on finding relationships between words used to describe both the antecedents and accounts of abusive episodes, it provides a more comprehensive understanding of abusers' perceptions of these events."

Rigorous audience consultation and field evaluations were undertaken to understand the efficacy of a range of interactive dramatic elements. Further research demonstrates positive changes in the levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding HIV and AIDS prevention and care, particularly among sexually active male viewers in urban and rural areas. Additionally, the survey data indicates that the program spurred interpersonal communication within the homes and peer groups of this population, which had a positive association with reported knowledge and behaviour change. Taken together with the qualitative analysis, the data indicates a structural shift amongst the audience members in overcoming the cultural barriers and taboos surrounding interpersonal communication on (sex) HIV and AIDS. The social significance of this phenomenon is explored."

In the past the different approaches had not been able to validate this hypothesis scientifically. This paper for the first time introduces a game theoretical approach to start a new verifying trial. Additionally the contribution leads the discussion to a new and distinct view of journalistic quality. The paradigm: Only definite settings let media quality be measurable. With that this paper will deal with the tradition of the Frankfurt school of sociology following Horkheimer, Adorno and not to forget Habermas. Even today there are plenty of possibilities to successfully refer on findings originally put on the scene about thirty years ago  especially in the field of political communication. Contrasting approaches located in political communication, the paper deals with economic purposes, to be exact: political economy. With that, this paper on one hand fits quite well in current analysis of critical theory and with looking back it on the other hand opens a topic to an international scale, which is up to now mainly discussed in a European context. The core target of the contribution is to proof the concept of journalistic adaptation and its essence of forecasting the consequences of gaining commercialization in media markets."

The study explored how news forms could be seen as shaping or not shaping the news. This textual analysis uncovered and explored a tension between textbook portrayals of a logical structure, primarily the inverted pyramid form, and a story structure. Foundational to this research is the use of narrative theory as a means of identifying when and how textbooks explored the range and role of news structures. Rather than accept the conclusion of some narrative theorists that forms and structures inherently reshape and restructure reality, this research put that conclusion to a testexploring how news forms might be seen as formative."

This presentation will consider recent journalistic and public policy discourses surrounding these sites  often run surreptitiously out of minors rooms  especially the uneasy representation of teens as simultaneously stars, victims, producers, perpetrators, and entrepreneurs. It will also examine the web-based investigative practices used to uncover mediated child porn crimes in order to elucidate and problematize new uses of the Internet in investigative reporting. I argue that what is being produced is not only a classic narrative of underage victims and adult perpetrators but also a new set of complex social, legal, and professional relationships enabled by and embedded within these new technologies."

Results of content analysis of U.S. and South Korean newspapers are compared with data from a survey of U.S. and South Korean journalists who covered the six-party nuclear talks. Because of a high level of accessibility and credibility, government officials are dominant sources in media coverage of the talks. Individual journalists perceptions of source credibility are more strongly correlated with their individual use of sources than the news medias aggregate use of sources. These findings contribute to research on media choices of sources."

It provides a detailed road map to the manipulation of scientific analysis in an administration that had a checkered record across a number of areas of scientific inquiry  offering a systematic framework for analyzing the research process and an accounting of the policy, research and legal costs of abuse of the research process.
The abuse involved suppression of contrary research results, narrowing of research questions, biasing of research design, manipulation of peer review, and ultimately a cover up. The purpose was to create a record to support further deregulation of media ownership, but the results-driven nature of the research produced studies that were not only tainted, but methodologically weak  nothing less than junk science.
From the policy perspective, the studies missed obvious alternative explanations or interpretations of the data, ignored broader implications of the research for public policies, played down the role of market concentration, failed to analyze market level effects and narrowed the range of variables used to measure policy relevant outcomes.
From the research perspective, the manipulation of the peer review process resulted in the publication of research with fundamental flaws including questionable assumptions, unrepresentative samples, poorly defined or missing variables, and improperly specified statistical models.
From the legal perspective, the Administrative Procedures Act, the Information Quality Act, and criminal laws may have been violated."

This research analyzes 519 newspaper articles from two Hawaiian newspapersThe Honolulu Star Bulletin and The Honolulu Advertiserover a seven-year period. The analysis shows that media frames change over time, when a frame changes so does the tone of the article, and each level of article (headline, quotes, etc.) showed different frame usage. In addition, this analysis is one of the first to examine the use of pictures within each article and between newspapers. The findings suggest that the medias coverage of land debates needs to be examined further to include the use of media frames, quotes, and pictures."

The reproductive justice framework reveals how womens overall health, access to medical care, and economic situation are all connected to the traditional assumption of reproductive rights that only addresses legal protections like the right to a legal abortion. So, how might a traditional, mainstream reproductive rights organization like Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) address the abortion issue without alienating its reproductive justice consistency? Influenced by message framing and its relationship to symmetrical approaches to public relations, this research project analyzes PPFA public relations materials  specifically press releases published on PPFAs website from March 2006 to March 2007. The data set includes releases about the South Dakota decision, other states abortion decisions, and the U.S. Federal Abortion Ban. The analysis of data draws upon the history of abortion rights activism and the criticisms of it as presented by both activists and scholars. Several germinal reproductive justice texts were analyzed to identify ideals of reproductive rights activism as practiced by mainstream reproductive rights organizations as well as ideals of reproductive justice activism. Then, these categories were applied to the PPFA press releases to determine how representative current PPFA language is of reproductive justice ideals. The essay concludes with a discussion of the findings and their relevance to contemporary activism against reproductive oppression."

On the basis of a multi-wave panel survey and a longitudinal content analysis of newspapers and television news magazines during the 2002 Dutch parliamentary election campaign, this question is answered by comparing news effects on lowly- and highly-knowledgeable audiences, either with a sporadic or a frequent exposure to the news. Results show that knowledge and exposure are not interchangeable. Citizens with a poor political knowledge who pay frequent attention to the news are most strongly affected by the news, as mediated cognitively through their perceptions of party performance. Knowledgeable voters with a sporadic exposure to media rely most strongly on predispositions. Every audience is susceptible to the news, especially for attributions of successes and failures."

This paper looks at the challenges and opportunities that owning a radio can give to a minority group in the midst of political and social struggle for legal recognition. Media privatization and consolidation is taking away the right of citizens to have open and participatory democratic processes. There is a clear inequitable access to communication channels where people, and in particular immigrants can engage in a local and national dialogue regarding pressing social issues such as labor, education, and citizenship. Thus, creating community media is a strategic manner to produce and distribute a wider range of voices from within an ethnically diverse community such as Latinos and indigenous from Latin America living in the United States."

It was then the only sexual minority periodical produced in North Carolina. More than thirty years later, UNCs Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, TransgenderedStraight Alliance continues publishing Lambda, now the oldest campus magazine for sexual minority students in the country. The research presented in this paper aimed to determine the role that the contextual elements of time period, location, and the goals of its parent organization, played in the establishment and the original character of Lambda. Results are based on a content analysis of the newsletters first three years of publication, and on oral histories of three individuals who were involved in the newsletters early existence. The findings indicate that the establishment and initial character of the newsletter were (1) informed by the gay rights movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s; (2) facilitated by the political focus of the CGA; and (3) affected by the newsletters location at a Southern university; but (4) shaped most uniquely by the overriding CGA concern to promote the healthy psychosocial development for homosexual individuals not only at UNC, but throughout North Carolina and the Southeast."

The role of adaptability in social and intercultural interactions as well as second language acquisition is first introduced, followed by a description of how students of varying language backgrounds perceive themselves as adaptable communicators based on a six dimension scale. A quantitative analysis of variance of survey data about self-perceptions of communicative adaptability (N=1118) shows where variations among monolingual native speakers of English, multilingual native speakers of English, and English language learners lie. Statistically significant differences occurred in the dimensions of social experience, articulation, and wit, and interesting similarities were found in the dimensions of composure, confirmation, and appropriate disclosure. These findings have implications for how native speakers of English and language learners participate in and negotiate intercultural interactions."

We study this dramatic news event to evaluate the accuracy of news reporting on this event, as well as the character of the national immigration rights debate. We analyze 90 local and national news stories about immigration, and the programs broadcast on May 1st and May 2nd 2007, with critical text and visual discourse analyses that are informed by cognitive science. To determine the accuracy of the news reporting, we compare news accounts to LAPD's own internal report on the day's events. We explore the implication of the reporting on the ongoing public sphere debate on national immigration policy. (2 May 2007 Los Angeles Times headline)"

Common themes that have surfaced among women include gender/ethnicity/social class identification with characters and life cycle themes. Women exercise critical skills by rejecting, talking back, and contradicting characters as part of their popular culture entertainment. Women and men can use TV programs such as soap operas to keep in touch with a generalized Latino culture, envisioned as an ethnic homeland culture located in shared memory in the distant past. Women and men can learn new things about mainstream Anglo-dominated society regarding social behaviors in public and work. Methodological issues in the field are still alive regarding power (knowledge, social class), control (how to manage interpret the information), and language use (domain-defined English-Spanish use, style and accent)."

The importance of leadership at all levels is demonstrated and published in numerous studies, but empirically hardly tested. A distinction was made between information and communication and tested, besides trust in top management and role of direct supervisors, on their influence on support for the change and contribution to the change. We found that trust in top management had a significant influence on the support for the change, and that the role of direct supervisors had a significant influence on the contribution to the change. From the first study we concluded that especially the interactions between management and employees during organizational change is troublesome in the organizations that participated. To test these interactions more thoroughly we conducted a total of 37 interviews on line communication in two organizations. The main conclusion from our study is that the success of an organizational change largely depends on the informative and communicative skills of managers at all levels."

It enables an investigation of the leader?s value commitments and ethics as, in a certain sense, constitutive of the organization, its position, its distinctiveness, and its success. Data from this chronological case study consisted of narratives which were collected through extensive textual analysis and an in-depth interview with Anita Roddick and Body Shop Directors. The narrative analysis progressed through three distinct levels, beginning with a thematic analysis and moving ultimately to a critical-interpretive approach that drew especially on concepts from rhetorical criticism and critical narrative analysis. The analysis revealed that Roddick?s ability to think in narrative terms allowed her to construct The Body Shop?s identity in the form of life stories. Because the practical nature of storytelling incorporates theories of the Self, Roddick achieved coherence by preserving and rendering permanent, key moments in both her personal and organizational development, and presenting them as part of a lived narrative. Not only did these stories shape Roddick?s identity, they attempted to strategically position the identity of the organization in the minds of internal audiences. But as The Body Shop identity evolved so too did its leadership and image. In fact, more recent changes at The Body Shop leave one asking whether the recent sale of The Body Shop has shed a new light on the ethics of corporate identity and responsibility."

Following in the tradition of Heideggers ontological shift away from a Cartesian split between mind and matter as well as Merleau-Pontys turn to the body as a locus for action, scholars such as Hubert Dreyfus and Andy Clark are working to reconceptualize the relationship between our brains, our bodies, and the world. Contrary to cognitive science, this new model offers a different perspective on external objects and internal experience. If, as Andy Clark says, mind is a leaky organ, how might accepting this hypothesis change the way we think about the relationship between experience and media? His model provides a means to reconfigure media reception in ways that circumvent the often paralyzing dichotomy of structure versus agency. Studies of reception have long relied on an idea of media consumption as having potential for resistance to ideology encoded by producers. Viewing the phenomenology of media through the lens of this revisionist perspective on cognitive science aligns perception with cognition and embodied action-taking. Understanding media perception as embodied cognition provides new ways to consider the interaction between culture and consumption."

Dutch Media and Politics,News and Politics,"This study assesses to what extent the Dutch electorate was given a pluralistic offer of viewpoints in the media coverage during the election campaign of 2006. Moreover, we looked at the extent to which voting behavior of newspaper readers was a reflection of this offer. The level of pluralism of five traditional newspapers with a partisan history, stemming from pillarization, and two free dailies was measured. Hereby we looked at three forms of bias: Coverage bias, referring to the amount of attention media pay to political actors; agenda bias, focusing on the issues covered in the different newspapers; and statement bias, dealing with media opinions about the political actors in the campaign arena. We combined these date with opinion data collected from a bi-weekly seven wave panel survey. Our study detected two interesting features of the relationship between media and politics. First, the traditional newspapers are, to a certain degree, still characterized by a bias towards the parties they used to be aligned with. Second, news coverage knows a power bias; incumbent parties receive more attention than opposition parties, although the tone towards incumbent parties is more negative."

The co-option of younger and younger laborers into the labor circuit particularly in developing countries is a
central part of her second book, Mediated Identities: Television, Globalization, and Youth Cultures (Peter Lang). McMillin has argued in her first book, International Media Studies (Blackwell), for a re-orientation in international communication scholarship contending that research in the field follows the trajectory of historical inequity, most significantly, colonialism. McMillin integrates her fieldwork in India and her collaborative experience with researchers associated with the Internationales Zentralinstitut für das Jugend- und Bildungsfernsehen (Munich) in her teaching, to offer a variety of courses in international communication that combine theory with practical community development. Students in her ""Communication for National Development"" class for example, assess grassroots projects around the world; they then go out into the local community to research grassroots development first hand and use multimedia to showcase such efforts to the campus and community. McMillin's research and teaching therefore, attempt to connect learning

Specifically, the FMD hoax induced organizational learning. Facing a potential economic catastrophe, government spokespersons simultaneously emphasized their preparedness and the perspective that the threat was likely a hoax. Although the New Zealand response was highly effective, the group sought out opportunities for improvement. Eventually, New Zealand emerged as model for vicarious learning in countries with a similar dependence on livestock industries."

Using the 2002 and 2004 Pew Media Consumption Surveys, I found that watching the show was positively related to political knowledge on the part of viewers who normally did not consume traditional news in 2002; the positive relationship diminished as traditional news consumption increased among show viewers. The interactive effect between The Daily Show viewing and exposure to traditional news sources was not statistically significant in 2004, however. My findings suggest that programs like The Daily Show could help to reduce the knowledge gap between news junkies and those who normally do not watch traditional news programs."

This paper reports on an exploratory study which sought to investigate the technology-related perceptions of older Maori (the indigenous people of New Zealand) and to identify the key factors that influenced those perceptions. The results, developed from an analysis of focus group discussions with 39 participants, found that their primary construction of computers was that of a two edged sword and their relationships with computers were significantly shaped by the particular social setting in which they encountered the technology. Based on these findings, implications for theory and practice are offered as are suggestions for future research."

The law against all religious signs was passed in March 2004, when in 1989, the state had uneasily tolerated the headscarf. Through discourses of state authority and definitions of the restricted place of religion in the public sphere and of the place of Muslims as citizens, the law was made to appear reasonable, and the headscarf was symbolically excluded from the nation because of its associations with communitarianism, gender inequality and religious fundamentalism. Laïcité was the umbrella principle that argued not only that all citizens were to put aside their differences to come together as a nation, but also that religion belonged firmly in the private sphere, and that women’s equality was to be protected. The coverage contained a sublimated race/ethnicity discourse because it constructed the Muslims as essentially incapable of rationality and therefore in need of disciplinary action to inculcate in them the values that they lacked."

The Visual Legacy of the Bush Administration - A View From Abroad,Visual Communication Studies Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"The suggested interactive paper is exploratory in nature, aiming at a typology of visual strategies of the Bush administrations first term of office (2001-2005). Drawing on the theoretical framework of media events developed by Dayan and Katz (1992) this paper adds a view from abroad by fusing the Dayan and Katz methodology with the typology of US-presidential visual strategies developed by a German author (Müller 1997). The paper aims at developing a theoretical and methodological framework to analyze orchestrated media events of the Bush administration, thereby developing a chronology of media events, both choreographed and non-choreographed, and discussing the question whether the Bush administration followed a strategic propagandistic script, or whether Mission Accomplished rather follows the tradition of choreographed pseudo-events as defined by Boorstin in 1961. In the actual poster, the key question that will be answered is what is the visual legacy of the Bush administration?"

Findings indicate the crime and suspect frame was the most dominant, while the graphic frame was used less often than previous research suggested. The tension management frame, characterized primarily by images of students mourning their fellows at memorial services, was used infrequently the day after the shooting, but became more popular as time passed. Supplementing these findings, members of the victims' families were interviewed to understand the audience' perception of the coverage. Through a comparison of the victims' families' perceptions and the content of visual images, this study thoroughly explores the outcome of the difficult decisions visual editors must make while covering a traumatic event and the perceptions of those directly effected by the event."

Arguably the most recognizable form of technology in music is the machinery used in sound production and consumption. Yet in the 1980s, while many popular musicians seized upon new devices such as sequencers, MIDI, digital recording and turntabling, Prince avoided these and adopted a somewhat anti-machine stance. More recently, Prince has challenged record labels by avoiding established distribution practices and bodies. Yet unlike many artists, Prince has accomplished this by circulating printed CDs rather than Internet-based sound files. Despite his apparent leeriness towards musics newest machines, Prince clearly employs means of some kind to produce and distribute his music. This calls for an examination of the criteria of technology, and a further consideration of non-machine based technologies. When Prince does highlight machine elements in music, his accompanying gender presentation problematizes straightforward associations between gender and technology. For example, his refusal of sound-manipulation devices may be interpreted as either a feminine refusal of mastery and control over natural objects such as sound, or else a hyper-masculine display of sound-forging prowess that requires little mechanical support. Ambiguous gender signifiers in Princes songs, including Lets Pretend Were Married, allow both readings to be supported. Prince challenges rigid equations between machine technology and gender, just as he calls into question the entire relationship between musical practices, machines, gender expression and technology."

The argument is made that, for most of its history, communication and media research has concerned itself with the overt exercise of media power rather than the capacity for such an exercise; furthermore, that most structuralist exceptions to this obsession with exercised power have remained beholden to a vulgar Marxist conception of power; and finally, that recent movements in the field towards more complex notion of symbolic power and its relationship with various other forms of power mark a welcome conceptual advance. Nevertheless, even these theoretical moves neglect issues of authority in media institutions. To correct for this imbalance, I try to tease out the conceptual distinction between power and authority in the field of media research and argue that non-normative questions of institutional media authority deserve more attention than they have thus far received from scholars in the communications field. I argue that while authority necessarily involves questions of legitimacy and right, scholarship in this vein need not be necessarily and irreducibly normative. I examine the well-known attempt by Barbie Zelizer to move issues of journalistic authority towards the center of communications research, and conclude by advancing my own understanding of the relationship between power and authority in communication and media studies."

This new phenomenon has raised a fundamental question whether non-Western countries are able to expand their cultural penetration, not only in the same region but also in the global cultural market. It is also questionable whether this contra-cultural flow has to be claimed that an asymmetrical cultural flow in favor of the West, in particular, the U.S.s dominance has diminished. Using Linage games, in conjunction with the Korean online games, as a case, this study attempts to discuss the way in which the local online game industry has produced a global phenomenon. In other words, the goal of this study is to trace the production dynamics to identify the conditions that have rendered contra cultural flow possible. It discusses the process by which a local culture is appropriated for the global audience. The task this paper sets out to accomplish is to understand the critical dialogue played by the global-local paradigm in transnationalizing local culture for the global cultural market."

Language generated during a small group task was analyzed using automated computer analysis techniques. The amount of verbal synchrony, or language style matching (LSM), generated between group members was correlated with ratings of group cohesiveness and task performance. LSM was positively associated with cohesiveness, but was not related to performance. These findings are consistent with previous findings of non-verbal synchrony as an indicator of liking. Further analysis assesses the possibility of other linguistic categories (e.g. word count, pronoun usage, emotional language) acting as predictors of cohesiveness and performance. The methodological implications of linguistic analysis as an objective, and unobtrusive measure of group cohesiveness are discussed."

We wish to determine the extent to which the research programs associated with these two theories can inform one another and be synthesized into a broader understanding of parent-child relationships and family communication. Using correlational and multiple regression analyses we explore the connection that authoritative, authoritarian and permissive parenting have with consensual, protective and pluralistic family types. We find evidence of significant conceptual and empirical overlap and argue that, with caution, researchers may extrapolate findings regarding these theories onto each other."
2008-0757,Listening Otherwise: The Voice of Ethics,"Ethics of Perception, Ethics of Communication",,,,Paper,Listening Otherwise: The Voice of Ethics,"Ethics of Perception, Ethics of Communication","The issues of response and responsibility are woven into the center of dialogic ethics (Levinas, 1969,1998, 1999; Schrag, 1986, 2003; Hyde, 2001, 2003), yet quietly embedded persists a hidden but presupposed prior action --that of listening -- about which the philosophy of dialogue falls, ironically, silent. The idea of the response as related to ideas of reply, answer, and reaction as well as its etymological derivation from the Latin spondere to pledge (promise, offer, sacrifice) stresses only the speaking of an ethical actor. The act of listening is itself concealed and rendered invisible. This paper suggests that the answer to the ethical call of conscience is not a speaking, but a listening. It is, moreover, a listening otherwise that suspends the willfulness of self and fore-knowledge in order to receive the singularities of the alterity of the other. To say that ethics arises from listening is thus to subordinate speaking to a kind of listening that speaks  a listening that is awakened and attuned to the sounds of difference rather than to the sounds of sameness. Thus its rarely a question of whether or not the voice of ethics speaks, for the voice is always speaking. The question is whether we are listening."

Prairie, a sitcom centred on a Muslim community in small-town Mercy,
Saskatchewan. Created by Zarqa Nawaz, the show begins with the creation of a
mosque in an Anglican parish hall, and among the comedic setups is the use of
recycled hockey boards as a barrier separating male and female participants.

Only two years earlier, the National Film Board of Canada released Me and the
Mosque, Nawaz's documentary questioning such segregation. The film includes
animations alongside tough interviews, but the tone is serious, in keeping with
Nawaz's journalistic training.

This paper will consider the ways in which Nawaz communicates theological

with Canadian and foreign viewers, Muslim or not. Included in this discussion
will be blogs, Facebook groups and wikis associated with Little Mosque.

Building on this perspective I have been able to describe and explore my own experience as chief executive of an organization in the midst of the complexities of a potential merger with its main competitor. I am particularly interested in further developing the theme of emergence of leader identity as a practice of upholding the paradox of ""detached involvement"". I explore the challenges of working with this in everyday practice where not only many aspects of the process are entirely beyond my control, but even my own identity and sense of self as leader is at stake."

Indie music can now be disseminated online, and people can easily connect across localities, regions, countries, and continents. As internet options for the discussion and sharing of indie music increase, the local spaces devoted to interaction around music could suffer. Yet even in the internet era of music production and distribution, local spaces and identities remain important, providing the necessary infrastructure required for music scenes to survive. Indeed, this paper argues, the decentralization and globalization of music production and the dissemination and consumption that the internet is credited with fostering has not resulted in the disappearance of (and in some cases may strengthen) senses of local identity, of local scene history, and of the existence of local sounds.

Evaluating Cross-National Evidence,"I focus on the change in social networks, using longitudinal data from our random-sample panel study of a random sample of adults in the Yamanashi prefecture. I analyze how different forms of computer mediated communication enhance different type of social networks. Different types of Internet usage are differentially related to social ties. While the more social ties people have, the more they are likely to use email from their PCs. Indeed, the use of PC e-mail increases social ties. However, the more supportive ties people have, the more they tend to use e-mail from their web-enabled phones. Yet, the use of mobile phone e-mail does not increase supportive ties. These findings suggest that PC e-mail may increase the size of personal social networks, while mobile phone e-mail is useful in maintaining existing strong and supportive ties."

Correlations confirmed that new media have displaced international letters, domestic telephones, and telexes. The trends for domestic mail and international telephone calls show exponential growth. Correlations also show that the new media do not substitute for domestic letters and international telephone calls. These traditional media supplement the new media. Mobile telephones and the Internet have had displacement effects on domestic telephones. Also, the results show that international telephone and the Internet have displaced international mail. The Internet has a supplement effect on international telephones, but it has begun to displace international telephone calls. Finally, television, mobile telephones, and the Internet are at the exponential or logistic growth stage and supplement each other."

Further intensified by the meteoric rise in Internet dating and mate selection, this bias often serves an invalidating function for darker-skinned women, This study analyzed profiles and preferences of brides and grooms (N = 200), and coded success story wedding photos (N = 200) posted on four Indian matrimonial web sites. Results showed an overwhelming bias among males for brides who were lighter skinned than themselves. Males also were more likely than females to state a preference for skin color in their prospective brides, and to use qualitative words, such as beautiful and lovely to describe their preferred match. Most significantly, the success-story wedding photos consistently had lighter-skinned brides than grooms, with dark-skinned women almost non-existent in these success stories. The findings point to a technology-abetted intensification of colorism, in which the powerful profile menu options and the visual imagery of predominantly light-skinned, successful brides illustrated on current webs sites visually reinforce the invalidation of dark-skinned women."
2008-0764,Looking for News Space or Thinking Strategically? The Case of the Spanish Governments Communication,Exploring Governments' Communication Strategies and Their Implications for Social Impact,,,,Paper,Looking for News Space or Thinking Strategically? The Case of the Spanish Governments Communication,Exploring Governments' Communication Strategies and Their Implications for Social Impact,"Government communication strategies vary in the way they involve people needs and demands in public policies-decision making. Kriesis model for analysis (2004) differentiates between top-down strategies, media strategies, and bottom-up strategies. Aiming at assessing how the public sphere is implicated in public policy, this author thinks that conditions regarding events, actor constellations, and speaker attributes are connected with each strategy. Audience democracy appears to be a complex set of interrelations. The basic assumption of his model is that even when studies focus on countries that share similar cultural, economic, and politico-institutional characteristics, and even when the same issues are selected, a great variation in the range of actors and their respective strategies in trying to shape public opinion will be found.
This paper analyses the evolution of government communication in Spain in the transition to democracy. Using in depth interviews with all Governments Spokespeople in Spain from 1986 until 2006, it assess different strategies employed. For the analysis of models Denton and Woodwards typology (1998) is applied: the press agent model, the events coordinator model, and the strategic planner one. For the operational analysis, three-tier communications operation suggested by Kumar (Kumar, 2003: 377) are looked at: the strategy level (units and their resources that compose the organizational structure), the operational level (how strategies are carried out) and the implementation level (how message is translated into words and pictures).
Ultimately, the question of the aim of government communication and its implications for social impact is addressed testing the assumption that the difference between the better mutual understanding aim and the simply disseminating favourable information aim is that while the first demands strategy, the second, for being uni-linear information, does not."

In the first session, participants indicated interest in politics and news, political attitudes, with four target issues embedded, along with attitude certainty and importance. Attitude accessibility data were derived from response latencies. In the second session, participants browsed an online opinion forum with eight texts about four issues, each with a pair of articles presenting opposing views. Selective exposure was unobtrusively recorded by software and coded as attitude-consistent and counter-attitudinal based on individual participants attitudes. Results show that attitude-consistent exposure dominated regardless of particular issue, with 36% more reading time. Higher habitual news use and attitude certainty both fostered attitude-consistent exposure. Selection of counterattitudinal articles was more likely among participants with greater interest in politics, conservative party preference, stronger party preference, more accessible attitudes, and higher attitude importance."

A Comparison of Cancer-Genetics Reporting in the Press Release and its Subsequent Coverage in Lay Press,News Coverage of Cancer and Science: Content and Effects,"Understanding how genetic science is communicated to the lay public is of great import, given that media coverage of genetics is increasing exponentially and that the ways in which discoveries are presented in the news can have significant effects on a variety of health outcomes. To address this issue, this study examines the presentation of genetic research relating to cancer outcomes and behaviors (i.e., prostate cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, smoking and obesity) in both the press release (n=23) and its subsequent news coverage (n=71) by using both quantitative content analysis and qualitative textual analysis. In contrast to earlier studies reporting that news stories often misrepresent genetics by presenting biologically deterministic and simplified portrayals (e.g., Mountcastle-Shah et al., 2003; Ten Eych & Williment, 2003), our data shows no clear trends in the direction of distortion toward deterministic claims in news articles. Also, other errors commonly attributed to science journalism, such as lack of qualifying details and use of oversimplified language (e.g., fat gene) are observed in press releases. These findings suggest that the intermediary press release rather than news coverage may serve as a source of distortion in the dissemination of science to the lay public. The implications of this study for future research in this area are discussed."

Content Analysis of Dutch News Coverage (1995-2005),Shifting Criteria in Crime and Disaster Reporting,"The mid-nineties saw the rise of a new type of criminal in the Netherlands: charming young men using a combination of emotional blackmail and violent coercion to recruit under-age girls for prostitution. This study tracks the media career of these so-called loverboys from a constructionist point of view, analyzing claims-making and problem ownership as reflected by the selection of news sources. Source selection, moreover, was contrasted with journalistic codes of conduct.
Contrary to the expected predominance of law sources in crime news, content analysis of loverboy coverage (1995- 2005) in five major Dutch newspapers and ANP (Associated Dutch Press) press agency wires reveals that the views of social workers, interest groups, and victims dominate the news. Source selection, moreover, is not in accordance with professional standards of reliability and balance. Journalists reproduced the frame offered by social workers and pressure groups. Implications of this journalism of attachment are discussed."

Entertainment television, particularly makeover television, can be democratic in terms of bringing together varied groups of people as audiences, instructing them on issues and processes, and encouraging them to take action. Entertainment television has the ability to instruct groups which are often marginalized from political processes on various modes of citizenship, allowing them to chose from a variety of different options for participation in public life, even if not overtly political option. Television as a whole is ideologically contradictory, so the options for citizenship are wide and often contradictory as well. However, makeover television instructs viewers on a relatively narrow view of citizenship, that of adherence to a particular middle-class aesthetic. It democratizes information on beauty and class, instructing a wide variety of disenfranchised groups in this mode of citizenship, yet does not pose alternatives and discredits anyone in favor of an alternate aesthetic or alternate view of the good citizen."

Teens consume the most media of any age group, discuss it with their peers, and model their identities after their favorite stars. However, little is known about teens media use during life transitions  like the one from high school to college. This study employs a longitudinal qualitative research design grounded in the uses and gratifications framework to investigate the links between media use, social networks, and personal identity during this life transition. Findings suggest informants media use evolves to meet the changing demands of the college environment and their identity project."

Sometimes, however, employees may experience out-of-the-ordinary events (critical incidents), which disrupt their established routines and evoke conscious thought on what the organization values and appreciates, and how it sees its members. These types of sensemaking processes are investigated in this study, focusing on the question how employees derive meaning from critical events that they experience in their organization. The results show that everyday experiences may have a broad range of implications for employees. In other cases, ?sense-keeping? seemed to occur, since employees brought about incidents which exactly fit their own frame of reference."

These expectations pervade D/discourse. The result is cognitive dissonance concerning the incommensurability of EWH and WLB co-existing in the same institutional discourse. This dissonance is felt and expressed in the discourses of these managers in day-to-day practice of their work as they try to reconcile unwritten expectations of EWH with their individual sense of obligation to their organisation, which is a party to this anomaly. What results are shifting states of compromise, avoidance, self-justification, and confusion as these managers negotiate their claims of choice and control in their own lives. In larger terms, the rationale of institutional expectation is incommensurable with the implied reciprocal obligation of individual managers, whose agency is thus threatened. In contemporary work where increasing EWH are its common sense, particularly for management, its practitioners face negative ramifications for their health and well-being, with an associated detriment to their families, and the communities in which they live."

Using the Leximancer program, we found clear intergroup differences in patient focus at clinical handovers across the differing health professional roles. Specifically, we found that different health professions emphasised different aspects of patient management. Allied health professionals and doctors were most closely aligned in their discussion of patient care. We also found that health professionals differed in their beliefs about the clinical handover process and each health disciplines contribution. These findings are discussed in terms of the intergroup nature of the hospital culture and the social relations between the health professions."

This paper reports findings from the cross-national study Worlds of Journalisms that sets out to map journalistic cultures onto a grid of common dimensions and explore their variation across nations, various types of news organizations and different professional milieus. Another important goal is to identify the driving forces behind the still existing differences in journalistic cultures. The findings are based on coordinated and collaborative national surveys of journalists, as well as information collection about their respective news organizations, in 16 culturally diverse countries, including Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Egypt, Fiji, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Mexico, Romania, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Uganda and the United States. By integrating the advantages of a most similar systems design and a most different systems design, the paper interrogates assumptions of a universal professional journalism culture and assesses the relative contribution of contextual factors (gender, media ownership, cultural values, political systems, economic and human developments, media systems, etc.) to the global variation in journalism cultures."

In order to reach their goals people act and react, both providing a basis for measuring people's real-time experience during game play. Taking a wide perspective on the game experience in our studies we aim to link behavioural indicators (including postural data, and force measurements) to several game experience dimensions, most notably frustration, flow, and boredom. In our studies we place these measures side by side to self report measures of the game experience after the game has been played, and physiological measures, tapping how in-game and after-game experiences are linked. In a recent experiment we had participants play several levels of a FPS of which the level of difficulty was manipulated. The relationship between level of difficulty, posture and force exerted on interface devices will be presented."

Using the notion of field, provided by the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu, we map the institutional actors and the industrial changes taking place in the realm of television for Latinos during the past five years. The concept field allows us to think the Latino television industry as a space where the participants engage in a battleground for the legitimate definition of Latinos Latinidad. The U.S. Latino television field has been traditionally characterized by the commercial dynamics and the institutional role of the Spanish-language networks, where the Spanish language has been central to the dominance of these transnational corporations while obliterating the experience and presence of English-speaking Latinos. Today, this landscape is rapidly changing with the emergence of new English-language television networks targeting young Latinos and the incursion of mainstream English-language network targeting English-dominant and bilingual Latinos. The boom of the Hispanic market is attracting new players and opening up new sites of struggles. The Latino television field is expanding in the number of audiences but also in the number of players that are bringing new demographic, linguistic and cultural approaches. The new visibility of English-speaking Latinos and the eagerness of the media to reach them are having an impact on the larger discourses of Latinidad enacted in the television representations. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to map the state of the Latino television field and reflect on the implications of such changes."
2008-0778,Market Influences on Climate Change Frames in CNN and Fox News Channel Broadcasts,Framing News Content,,,,Paper,Market Influences on Climate Change Frames in CNN and Fox News Channel Broadcasts,Framing News Content,"In recent years, cable news stations have increasingly relied on a market model of the media to target news content to specific types of audiences. This targeting has the potential to cause news stations to ideologically tilt content towards the preferences of their viewers. The framing effects of news content that is changing in response to market pressures also interacts with the manner that advocates and skeptics for issues such as climate change choose to frame their discourse. Using a content analysis of climate change stories on Fox News Channel and CNN between 1998 and 2004, this study finds that CNN and Fox News Channel have significant differences in the manner that they cover climate change, with Fox News Channel generally offering more conservative coverage than CNN. This study also finds that climate change advocates and skeptics use different frames to discuss the issue, with advocates primarily using a disaster aversion frame and skeptics primarily using a scientific uncertainty and economic frame. These findings demonstrate the influence that market pressure is likely having on cable news stations and also illustrate the manner that climate change advocates and skeptics are talking about climate change on cable news channels. The implications of how these different frames may affect the public understanding and perception of climate change are discussed."

In recent years blockbusters have very often been sequels originated from books, comics or even theme park rides. From a marketing perspective there is an advantage in gain of the pre-sold property. There is the pre-sold property from the original source (book or comic) and the pre-sold property from the other parts of the movies. This paper will show with different examples (Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, Pirates of the Caribbean) how the marketing experts of the film studios keep the word-of-mouth and the interest in these films high over a period of several years. Looking at Lord of the Rings, the marketing kept the hype going for a period of almost 10 years. A cross-media strategy combining TV, DVD, Internet and video games interconnects to an overall strategy.

In this sense, a videogame is just one of many products in the chain of economic exploitation of blockbuster movies. As side products of films they address the original audience, the film viewers. On the other hand stand alone games such as Tomb Raider or The Sims address a specific game audience. Although intertextual relations are drawn to cross-media elements such as the adventure genre, they provide a world in itself for the player with no direct relation to an original template. Typically, successful games are reproduced in divers spin-offs and/or issued as serials. In this way, videogames have reached the state of blockbusters, with spin-offs, cross-media marketing (e.g. filmic version of a game) and serialization. This paper aims to examine the process of serialization and the aesthetics of successful games with a focus on the modes of pleasure that is provided for its gamers.

The first experiment asks how much personal experience with persons with metnal illness influences the processing of televised messages about mental illness. Cognitive and physiological responses while viewing of negative and positive portrayals of mental illness are measured. Participants who vary in terms of the amount of positive or negative contact they have in their daily lives with persons with mental illness were recruited from a county wide random survey. The second experiment assesses the short and medium term effects of viewing negative or positive portrayals of people with mental illness on stigmatizing attitudes.

Among 3,408 internet users, exposure to health information in newspapers and magazines, trust in health information on the internet, frequent community participation, and health-related social interaction were positively associated with online health information seeking. Results have notable implications for doctor-patient communication in a medical system that increasingly views patients as active consumers of health information and expects them to play a larger role in health and healthcare decisions. Our findings suggest many Americans are poised to use the internet as a resource in this role, but highlight the importance of health news exposure, trust, and social networks as factors that influence use of the internet as a health information resource. Results also underscore the importance of enhancing the credibility and quality of health web sites."

A sample of three Swiss grammar schools was chosen in which all newly formed school classes were analysis over the period of one school year. The data used for this analysis includes 17 school classes of the same age group with 434 students. Four survey panel waves were conducted with response rates ranging from 92.6 to 99.5%. This paper focuses on four types of TV programs which were identified by a principal component analysis of TV use of the students: boulevard news, soap operas, music television and the various C.S.I. and C.I.S. series. The use of these program types and its development within the social group over time is empirically analyzed with an actor oriented model. Findings show, that significant effects of social selection according to mass media use can be observed. This means that students with similar media use tend to become friends while students with different media use tend to have less contact. At the same time significant influence effects can be reported. The choice of different media programs therefore can not only be explained by individual characteristics but has to include the influence of the social network."

This study suggests an integrative model to explore the determinants of knowledge and attitude among health care workers in the context of maternal and infant health problems in rural communities of Indonesia. The relationship between three major sets of constructs is tested: information sources including media, training, institutional resources, and social relations; cognitive factors including domain-specific self-efficacy and collective-efficacy; and health-related knowledge acquisition and attitude formation.
The study found that both self-efficacy and collective efficacy beliefs predicted attitude. In addition, multiple domains of efficacy belief system were found to influence each other. In the post-intervention phase, the study will be extended to evaluate the impact of enhanced mobile-phone communication on health knowledge, attitude, and practices."

If practitioners and health communicators are to ethically and effectively solicit participation in cancer clinical trials, they must be sure potential participants have a clear understanding of the structure of the cancer clinical trial. A valid and reliable measure of cancer clinical trial understandings does not, however, exist. This study presents the development of a unidimensional self-report measure of cancer clinical trial understanding. Data from a national sample of both cancer survivors and the general public are consistent with the claim that the measure is valid and reliable. The theoretical and practical implications of this measure are discussed."

Today, international organizations and donors are involved in media development projects worldwide including the United States Agency for International Development, the British Broadcasting Corporation, Britains Department for International Development, and others. The United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization have cooperated on the growth of independent media in developing countries. Evaluating media development efforts is difficult. A number of indices have been developed to evaluate the conditions of media at the national level. These include the Freedom of the Press Index by Freedom House, the Worldwide Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders (RSF), and the Media Sustainability Index (MSI) by the International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX). These indexes are most successful at measuring professional training, technological, and legal conditions facilitating free speech. This paper addresses the assessment challenge in relation to citizen voice. A theoretically based model is proposed for measuring the representation of citizen voice in the public sphere. Results from research employing this model in a separate but related research area are reviewed. A research program to explore media development applications of the model is proposed."

In the wiki environment, group members not only debate the proposed policies, but are also actively involved in crafting the policy itself. We offer examples of direct and indirect measures of deliberation in Wikipedia policy making discussions. Direct measures include content analysis to assess the extent to which discussions exhibit aspects of deliberative discourse. Indirect measures involve social network analysis of the interaction structure, and participants' characteristics such as their edit history, length of time involved in Wikipedia, type of contributions, awards (or sanctions) received, and formal positions of authority. Combining the direct and indirect measures give scholars more nuanced understandings of the deliberative process in a wiki environment by addressing issues of status, reputation, and influence that have implications for forum design."

Since a lot of digital skill related interpretations are given to an extended range of terms only few frameworks are available that mostly lack operational definitions. To encourage more research to focus on in-depth skill measurements, we propose operational definitions for operational, formal, information and strategic skills. We use this framework to measure the Internet skills of the Dutch population at large, by giving 109 subjects nine assignments to be accomplished on the Internet. Subjects were recruited following a two step approach; randomly select a sample from the book/list of fixed telephony subscribers, followed by drawing a selective quota sample for the strata of sex, age and educational level. The results indicate that on average 80.1% of the operational skill Internet tasks, 71.5% of formal Internet skills tasks, 62% of the information Internet skills tasks and 22% of strategic Internet skills tasks assigned have been successfully completed. Performances are significantly different for people with high, medium and low level of education attained and for people with different age, but not for people with different sex, not for weekly time spent on the Internet, and on most occasions not even for years of Internet experience. Seniors above 55 perform worst in all skills. Young people between 18 and 30 are superior in operational and formal skills but not in information and strategic skills."

This paper stresses the dual character of media goods, the underlying ideological ideals, and the attendant institutional setting as source of value conflict in communications policy making. It discusses this value conflict and gives examples of where it surfaces and how it is confronted. It is particularly evident in cases of media concentration. Newly introduced communications laws and policies within Europe and the USA aim to reduce (ownership) regulation, promote competition and cope with the challenges posed by convergence. This quest is coupled in part with protections of media pluralism through custom-developed indices for measuring concentration in media markets and tests for assessing media plurality in merger cases. The paper describes and discusses such new methods and instruments as novel but imperfect attempts by policy makers to respond to the various challenges in communications such as value conflict, convergence, the need for empirical proof and claims for non-economic ways of assessing media diversity. It concludes by stressing the need to re-emphasize normative claims as essential guiding elements of communications policy making."

While vitality estimates can be measured objectively, they can also be measured subjectively. In other words, subjective vitality investigates the perceptions of how groups feel about their own group, and outgroups status, demography, and institutional support. The Subjective Vitality Questionnaire was developed by vitality theorists to measure subjective assessments of vitality. Although the measure has been utilized for over twenty-five years, little research has examined its validity. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to assess the validity of the SVQ. Data collected from three different ethnic groups who provided subjective vitality estimates using the SVQ are presented and analyzed. Suggestions for future use of the SVQ are offered."

Based on the extant literature we identify and operationalize the essential components of this new form of campaigning to create a 30 point index that is applied to the case of the 2005 German federal election. The results show the CAMPROF index is successful in capturing variance in parties engagement professionalized campaigning and able to produce rankings that correspond to apriori expectations about how well the parties would perform. The findings are significant in providing preliminary confirmation of the indexs capacity to measure new modes of voter contact and outreach by parties and candidates as well as providing new insights into the party-level dynamics that may be driving the current wave of campaign modernization. The opportunities and challenges involved in wider application of the measure to cross-national research are discussed.

2008-0794,Media and Conflict Resolution,Journalism and Transition,,,,Paper,Media and Conflict Resolution,Journalism and Transition,"Interest in the media's roles in conflict has been increasingly growing in the last fifteen years. Most studies however, have focused on the often negative contributions of the media to the escalation and violence phases of conflict. Scholars have paid much less attention to conflict resolution and reconciliation. This paper presents what we know about the media's roles in conflict resolution, what we need to know, and how we should fill the gaps in existing knowledge. It includes three parts. The first presents and analyzes various typologies of media intervention in conflict resolution and media coverage. The second part presents an analysis of positive and negative media contributions to several critical areas of conflict resolution including signaling and communication, confidence building and destruction, mediation, and promoting and cultivating negotiations and agreements. The last part offers a new framework for future research and practice based on integration of theories and approaches from the fields of communication and conflict studies."

To what extent have these changes affected perceptions of people on girls issues such as the sex imbalance of birth rates, girls education, trafficking girls and women, violence against girls and others in society? How have the mass media reflected calls for more sensitivity to gender issues? What are new actions by womens NGOs to promote gender issues into media and what are the challenges that remain? First, this presentation will picture gender issues/inequalities in relation to children and their media uses within the Chinese context. Next, girls issues in the mass media will be analyzed from a gender perspective. Finally, the author will discuss some strategies--- such as gender training for media professionals -- by UN agencies and womens NGOs so that they can promote fair representation and participation of girls in the media. Also, the limitations of these strategies and future challenges will be addressed.

2008-0796,Media and Interpersonal Predictors of Healthy Eating Behavior,High Density: Media Influences on Health,,,,Paper,Media and Interpersonal Predictors of Healthy Eating Behavior,High Density: Media Influences on Health,"An integration of social cognitive theory and an ecological perspective was employed to investigate the influence of media and social support on food response efficacy and healthy eating behavior. It was predicted that social support and attention to media for diet and nutrition information would positively predict both perceptions of food response efficacy, and healthy eating behavior, and that perceived self-efficacy would interact with media and social support to enhance effects on behavior. Results showed that media positively predicted fruit and vegetable response efficacy and healthy eating behavior, while emotional support from important others positively predicted fat response efficacy. An interaction was found between emotional support and fat self-efficacy, such that when people possessed higher levels of confidence in restricting their fat intake, emotional support positively predicted healthy eating behavior. Exploratory analysis of a subsample of female participants showed that at lower levels of fat self-efficacy, emotional support marginally predicted lower levels of healthy eating behavior. The findings suggest that in the absence of fat self-efficacy, encouragement to eat healthy may lead to defensive responses among women."

Following an overview, the focus is on the possibilities of Native Americans to promote their own ethnic identity through the media. Through an examination of the literature and empirical research, including personal observations among some Southwestern Native American groups, it discusses media representations that weaken rather than strengthen the self-esteem of its targets. Approaching the subject in the context of intercultural communication, it focuses on native language, media technology, and the publicity of information. It concludes that, to narrow the gaps in their own communities and to develop understanding between Native communities and the majority, mainstream culture, Native media must find cultural interpreters and media professionals in both cultures who understand the nature of technology, the cultures, and aims of the people of Native communities."

We conducted a survey of 621 adolescents aged from 11 to 18 years old in Singapore. We confirmed that adolescents celebrity worship in Singapore includes three aspects: Entertainment-Social values, Intense-Personal feelings, and Borderline-Pathological tendencies. All the three aspects of adolescents celebrity worship were associated with adolescents media consumption, and with the level of adolescents comparison to the celebrities. Also, we found that adolescents celebrity worship is associated with, materialistic values, self-esteem as well as life satisfaction. As adolescents worldwide all like to worship entertainment celebrities, findings of this study could be extrapolated to other societies in the world."

But class, age and appearance are not investigated in any depth and more subtle aspects of the phenomenon go unexplored. Findings indicate critiques themselves may face the constraints and influences true of any news work."

Media education curricula and pedagogies, based on current research and best practice, may allow young people to develop capacities to become more critically aware and active users of media and ICTs, that is to become active and autonomous citizens rather than passive consumers. The ramifications and assumptions of media pedagogy that look more closely at the underlying claims of difference, identity, and non-hierarchical teaching and knowledge suggest the need for new approaches to critical practice and interpretation. Through a grounded theoretical analysis of media curriculum, pedagogical practices, and the products and outcomes of media education, I ask how Ontario secondary schools have balanced their curricula demands with technological change. How does media education unfold in Ontario's varied schools and diverse classrooms?"
2008-0801,Media Effects on Public Safety in the Context of a Catastrophe,"Plague, Pandemic, and Catastrophe: Preparation and Response",,,,Paper,Media Effects on Public Safety in the Context of a Catastrophe,"Plague, Pandemic, and Catastrophe: Preparation and Response","Previous theoretical research provides a valuable picture of how media effects are expected to occur in times of societal change and conflict, with empirical research pinpointing the related role of news effects during the immediate response phase following a catastrophe. The current study expands upon this research by assessing both news and media campaign effects during the later recovery phase of a catastrophe, while, importantly, also relying on panel data to strengthen inferences of causation. With data from a panel telephone survey in New Orleans in 2006, this study tests lagged dependent variable models for safety beliefs and safety behavior in the context of Hurricane Katrina. News attention and media campaign exposure influenced safety behavior. The effects of news attention were synchronous, while those of media campaign exposure were cross-lagged. In contrast, neither news attention nor media campaign exposure influenced safety beliefs, which may be attributable to ceiling effects of the belief measure. Safety beliefs did, however, have a cross-lagged influence on safety behavior. These findings are discussed in reference to previous theoretical and empirical research, with recommendations made for future research and practice."
2008-0802,"Media Enjoyment as Experience: Segmentation, Cohesion, and Empathy",High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Entertainment Processing,,,,Paper,"Media Enjoyment as Experience: Segmentation, Cohesion, and Empathy",High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Entertainment Processing,"This study examines how audience members enjoyment of programs and program segments may differ, and some of the structural factors that may impact enjoyment. Drawing on recent research in psychology and marketing which suggests that suggests that people develop expectations about future experiences that are differentially affected by the positive or negative trend of an experience and by the segmentation of that experience, we examine the impact of structure and cohesion on enjoyment, and whether empathy interacts with structural factors in producing enjoyment.

Results suggest that the empathy, evaluative trend of the content and cohesion of the content appear to affect media enjoyment in main effects. Segmentation of content does not have a main effect, but instead works in interaction with cohesion; empathy does not interact with the structural factors in affecting enjoyment. Results are discussed in terms of current industry concerns regarding audience behavior and implications for communication research."
2008-0803,Media Exposure and Sensitivity to Violence in News Reports: Evidence of Desensitization?,"Violence, Aggression, and Empathy",,,,Paper,Media Exposure and Sensitivity to Violence in News Reports: Evidence of Desensitization?,"Violence, Aggression, and Empathy","Although most media effects scholars agree that media violence can contribute to desensitization, a relatively small number of studies have explored this outcome and many were conducted decades ago. The current study seeks to address this gap by studying whether levels of exposure to three different media formsentertainment television violence, local newspapers, and local television newsrelate to reactions to reading news stories that recount violent events. Survey results from 476 residents from three different regions in the U.S. show bivariate connections between average media exposure levels and each of three indicators of desensitizationself-reported emotional responses upon reading about the violent events, perceptions of degree of violence in the events covered in the stories, and notions of whether those events are commonplace. In hierarchical regression equations, exposure to both local TV news and local newspapers is shown to interact with respondents' trait empathy to predict two of the measures of desensitization under multiple controls. The study suggests, therefore, that heavy local news consumption---presumably due to the large presence of violent content within---can contribute to a blunted response when encountering new stories regarding real-life violent events, particularly when individuals have low trait empathy."

This survey of 7-16 year-old adolescent females yielded interesting but conflicting results with regard to potential correlates of higher or lower appearance evaluations. This study further examined the role that sports participation plays in shaping standards for ideal beauty, and how those standards are manifest in estimations of the attractiveness in others. A variety of media variables were measured to determine which ones might be related to higher self esteem, and to more positive appearance evaluations of others. The results indicate that combining these frameworks results in a unique intersection that offers deeper insight into how adolescent girls form perceptions of self and others. Given the uniqueness of this sample and the selectivity of their media use, the hope is that the results may prove helpful in understanding the complicated factors related to young girls desire to adopt or emulate societal beliefs that uphold attractiveness as an important attribute. These and other findings are discussed."

Using issue issue attention cycle and media frame building as theoretical frameworks, we combine quantitative content analysis and in-depth individual interviews with journalists and editors to identify the main influencers of media coverage. Results of the content analysis are compared and contrasted to American data. The goal of the analysis is to gain an understanding of the role of culture in shaping media content and to discuss the implications of the findings for public opinion about controversial science."

This paper explores the notion of corporate social responsibility (CSR) from a cultural perspective by examining how CSR news coverage between South Korea and the United States is framed differently through content analysis methodology. The results show that there are substantial cultural differences in news coverage between South Korea, a collectivistic country, and the United States, an individualistic country, in framing corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues. For example, news coverage from South Korea emphasized how CSR activities performed harmoniously among government, a company, and citizens. On the other hand, U.S. news coverage focused more on how individual company performed their social responsibility through their own resources. Further, this study provides useful implications for international public relations practices."

Though such centres often are imagined as immaterial and symbolic, the activity of modern media has also produced spatial centres that appear real enough, at times monumental. The project focuses on three case studies, all heavily influenced by the changing conditions of media technology and geopolitics: The BBCs Broadcasting House in London, inaugurated in 1932; the TV-centre Ostankino in Moscow from the 1960s, and the headquarters of Chinese Central Television, currently projected in Beijing by Rem Koolhaas. The paper has a focus on how to think the relations between media (ubiquitous, ephemeral) and architecture (territorial, massive), and explores this further through two of the case studies of the project: London and Moscow."

The Cultural Politics of Korean Wave in East Asia,Global Flows and Networks,"Pointing out some limitations of current media studies scholarship on globalization in terms of its inadequacies in understanding the forms and practices of cultural globalization at the intra-regional level, this paper undertakes to construct a theoretical framework through which to examine the global-local nexus within East Asian regional context. By taking up the case of Korean Wave, an increasing popularity of Korean media and popular culture in East Asia and beyond, it discusses both theoretical and policy implications of this Korean-version of hegemonic, expansionistic media regionalization in hampering cultural diversity in the region. Ultimately, the main goal of this paper is to take a critical yet context-specific look at the juncture where politics, economy, history, culture, and the media come together in fashioning the conditions, processes, and outcomes of cultural globalization in East Asia."

This paper proposes a conceptual model to describe how media strategies might lead to differences in smoking cessation between groups and reviews literature on the effectiveness of media interventions to promote smoking cessation among low SES populations. There is considerable evidence that media interventions to promote smoking cessation are often less effective, sometimes equally effective, and rarely more effective among disadvantaged populations relative to more advantaged populations. Disparities in the effectiveness of media interventions between SES groups may occur at any of three stages: differences in meaningful exposure, differences in motivational response, or differences in opportunity to sustain long-term cessation. Large-scale media interventions are more effective among low SES smokers when they are done in concert with other community interventions and changes in tobacco control policy. There remains a need to conduct research that examines the effectiveness of media interventions by SES. These studies should employ research designs that are sensitive to various ways that SES differences in smoking cessation media effects might occur."

In Singapore, a tropical island city-state of four million people off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, the highest governmental media agency  the Media Development Authority (MDA)  recently began to advocate media literacy as a means to become a global media production hub. The governments Media 21 plan  which includes plans to attract 10,000 new media jobs  advocates increasing production skills training for Singaporean students, and a growing number of Singaporean universities and polytechnics have expanded course offerings in this area. Given this activity, we ask two research questions: (a) What is the relationship between media education and awareness of media literacy components among Singaporean tertiary students? (b) What are the implications of our findings for the promotion of Singaporean media literacy within the context of globalisation?
Using a control-group design, 262 Singaporean tertiary students were surveyed regarding their awareness of the components of visual media literacy. Comparing media students to non-media students, we found that media education corresponded to an increased awareness of media literacy, but that the effect was more pronounced for production-oriented rather than consumption-oriented components; in fact, media education was associated with a significant decrease in the ability to distinguish fact from fiction when comparing the media students to the non-media students."

The Impact of Media Consumption on Political Interest,cholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Paper,Media Malaise or Virtuous Circle? The Impact of Media Consumption on Political Interest,Scholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,"Being politically interested is one of the most important norms from a democratic perspective, as it is a crucial antecedent for voting, political knowledge, civic and political participation, and attentiveness to political information. However, only limited research has focused on the relationship between media use and political interest, despite the notion that modern politics is mediated politics. Even more important is that the causal relationship between media use and political interest has still not been firmly established. Against this background, the purpose of this study is to investigate the causal relationship between news media use and political interest, using a three-wave panel study carried out in the context of the 2006 Swedish election. The results show that some, but not all, Swedish news media indeed do increase peoples political interest, thus lending support to the perspective of media mobilization theories rather than media malaise theories."

The intent of this program was to educate children about the contribution of advertising and other media content to health behaviors including tobacco use, nutrition, and violence. The fifth grades of three schools participated with two receiving the MediaSmart classes (n = 160) and one serving as a control (n = 50). Pre- and post-intervention surveys measured students perceptions of media influences, understanding of advertising techniques, media literacy efficacy, and participant responsiveness. Additionally, focus groups were conducted at treatment schools. Results indicate that MediaSmart participants increased their understanding of advertising influences and techniques. Students who responded most positively to the classes showed more learning and a stronger belief that they can resist media messages. Comments from the focus groups reinforced these findings."

Couldry and McCarthy (2004) are careful to point out that a spatially aware model of media studies also takes into account spatial politics, be they racism in city planning, environmental disasters, or the disposal of obsolete computers. Rarely though are the politics in question feminist intersectional politics. Media scholars who wish to re-think media as inherently spatial, and space as increasingly mediated  in ways that are materially specific, situated, embodied, sensorial, and political  clearly have a lot to learn from fields in which the politics and differentiation (in terms of sexual difference, sexuality, race, class, etc.) of bodies, space and place have been centre stage for a couple of decades."

As a result, the spatiality of media processes is often hidden. My contribution will argue that this problem does not disappear, even as media processes become explicitly more decentralized via digitization. This raises interesting issues in relation to the embedding of digital media use into new theories of transnational democracy, such as James Bohmans (Democracy Across Borders MIT Press 2007). Bohmans new work will be discussed as a case of where we must hold onto questions of media spatiality even when we examine how the space of media networks may permanently be stretching the spaces of democratic participation."

After explaining why the media system in Turkey resembles more to the 'polarised pluralist' system as a Mediterranean country (low circulation, high TV viewing, savage deregulation, organisations not being strong, less editorial autonomy ) I will also point out the differences (for example, newspapers are not being elite-oriented) and special characteristics of the Turkish politics (Kemalist ideology and changing polarisations in the society). The paper will discuss the negative and positive freedom conditions in Turkey with a reference to democratisation process in the path towards the EU membership. The role of the state and the market in shaping the media system in Turkey will be evaluated in a historical context."

The Role of the Communication Platform in Mediating Political Discourse,Wikis for Politics,"Communication scholars interested in the political potential of ""new media"" have begun to inquire as to whether these environments tend to produce a different kind of discourse, depending on their technological design. Technologies are not neutral. Social practices evolving around the uses of particular technologies account for and accommodate their particular affordances. In new media contexts, in what ways does the technological infrastructure mediate political deliberation? How do platforms for individual expression such as blogs, and platforms for collaborative content creation such as wikis, tend to produce different kinds of deliberation, particularly when it comes to contested topics such as conflict and politics? Building on data collected through the WikiCandidate project, this presentation will analyze the discourse evolving in a wiki environment, to identify the role of the technological platform and the associated social practices in the way this discourse takes shape."

An experiment demonstrated that mediated enactive learning through actively playing a healthy diet promotion game was more effective than observational learning through passive game watching in increasing self-efficacy and behavior intention. Mediation analysis found that identification with the avatar in the game mediated the relationship between the experience mode and the outcomes. This study suggests that increasing game avatar identification is important to design serious games for prosocial purposes."
2008-0820,Mediated Negotiations: A Case Study of a Transcultural Exchange Between Lebanon and Israel,Media Beyond the Middle East,,,,Paper,Mediated Negotiations: A Case Study of a Transcultural Exchange Between Lebanon and Israel,Media Beyond the Middle East,"In August 2006, an Israeli television channel aired a documentary produced by the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation. The film followed the events leading up to the prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hizbullah in 2004, and included never-before-seen images of a captive Israeli soldier who disappeared years ago. The paper examines the strategies and practices by which the LBC documentary was negotiated and (re)appropriated by the Israeli media within a complex cultural, political and economic context. It seeks to contribute to the growing literature on transnational communication and cultural appropriation by following recent developments in conceptualizing transculturation, and by connecting this area of research to theories of mediated witnessing and to the mythical and ritual qualities of news. The framework of analysis links production, textual and reception processes, most importantly by considering the ways in which appropriation strategies and attempts to sustain a collective witnessing position were linked to political-economic conditions and to the multiple agents that participated in the production of the text."

Overall, group 4 experienced better quality of life than groups 2 and 3, which were not significantly better off than group 1. Effects of the CHESS and mentor interventions appeared to be primarily through the Self-Determination Theory concept of relatedness, and in particular through the perceived interactivity and presence of resources."
2008-0822,Mediatization or Mediation? Alternative Understandings of the Emergent Space of Digital Storytelling,Digital Mediations of Personal Narratives,,,,Paper,Mediatization or Mediation? Alternative Understandings of the Emergent Space of Digital Storytelling,Digital Mediations of Personal Narratives,"This paper asks to what extent we can identify the conditions under which digital storytelling will contribute to the sustaining or expansion of democracy. Those conditions are difficult to identify because it is unclear whether digital storytelling is a distinct stage in the history of mass communication, or part of the supercession of mass communication. The article considers the contrasting implications here of two rival concepts in media theory: mediation and mediatization.
On balance, the article will argue that mediation may prove more flexible for understanding digital storytelling, because it can address in greater detail the varied circumstances in which digital stories will become articulated into social and political organization: the paper will here draw on the lessons from the historical spread of printing and widespread literacy (Wuthnow, Communities of Discourse 1987). Mediatization, by contrast, suggests that all the consequences of digital storytelling can be explained by reference to one or more common logics that dictate the form that digital story material must take. That prioritizes patterns of content over regularities of context and use. As a result, it may alert us less well to the more subtle consequences of a heterogeneous phenomenon such as digital storytelling."

By doing a secondary analysis of the same data, this study explored the mediating role of personal talk in the effect chain detected by Jenning and Zeitner. We found that despite the strong influence of Internet access and traditional mass media on civic engagement, when we controlled for the interpersonal talk, some of the significant effects disappeared. We conclude that online information seeking and political use of mass media facilitate the collective action and have the potential to affect the health of civic society; however, this effect is mediated through peoples personal talk. Implications of the results are discussed in the paper."

This examination takes the history of what Maurice Roche calls the the leading contemporary global mega-event, the Modern Olympic Games, as a case study of current mega-event research in its relation to significant social and critical theories, especially political economy.

What does mega-theory reveal of the meaning and significance of the Olympics? This essay seeks answers in a series of snapshots of the Olympics at specific moments in their modern history. Each snapshot is examined through a lens drawn from critical theory, with special attention to theories of mega-events and political economy. The snapshots are chronological; the theoretical lenses are inter-related and cumulative. They suggest enhanced views of the coming Games in Beijing, Vancouver, London, and Sochia.

Using data from interviews, surveys and the most-watched political animations and satire videos gathered during the Rethinking Media, Democracy and Citizenship project, I take up the question of how to interpret and trace the effects of these forms of political dissemination. Drawing on the work of theorists such as Deleuze, Massumi, and Terranova, I reframe the relationship between aesthetics and socio-political struggle to examine the impact of virals on collective memory, intellectual property and communication practices at a micropolitical level.

Although my analysis focuses on the dynamics guiding the development of online practices of resistance, it also questions some of the concepts that usually guide Net research. In particular, I reconsider definitions of political practices and effects, while avoiding dichotomies like online/offline and producer/consumer within a more synthetic approach to communication. While these redefinitions may avert still-necessary critiques of traditional forms of politics, they enable researchers to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of alternative practices of resistance.

With distance from the event, anniversary journalism is ideally situated to offer historical context and interpretation, powerfully linking the past, present and future through memory-work that mobilizes social transformation. However, on the whole, rather than encouraging deliberation, this study of 92 articles from the top ten circulation papers in the United States finds this anniversary coverage produces narratives that have the potential to instead stifle debate, focusing on cohesion rather than discussion."

An experiment was conducted in which participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions and were either exposed to four alcohol advertisements, four alcohol counter advertisements, or four control advertisements. Results indicated that as expected, exposure to the alcohol advertisements activated positive automatically-activated affect (implicit attitudes) toward alcohol use relative to the control condition, using supraliminally presented primes (75 ms) to assess such attitudes. No significant effect was found for the counter-advertisements versus control advertisements. Effects of condition on explicit attitudes were not statistically significant versus control. Additionally, the implicit attitude measure tended to better predict willingness to engage in less socially-acceptable risky behaviors (drunk driving) whereas explicit attitudes better predicted more acceptable risky behaviors (drinking games) in a college student population. As predicted, there were significant indirect paths to willingness to engage in risky behaviors from the experimental treatment through automatically-activated affect for four of five outcome measures, as well as a significant indirect path from the experimental treatment to explicit attitudes via automatically-activated affect."
2008-0828,Metaphorical Communication: The Effects of Figurative Language on Impression Formation,LSI Studies on Impressing Audiences,,,,Paper,Metaphorical Communication: The Effects of Figurative Language on Impression Formation,LSI Studies on Impressing Audiences,"Previous research in communications and psychology confirms that literal trait (e.g., hostile) and stereotype (e.g., African-American) expectancies can influence a perceivers interpretation of ambiguous information about a target person. In some cases, however, perceivers may possess a metaphorical expectancy regarding a target person (e.g., My boss is a baby). The present research demonstrates that metaphorical language of this nature can produce analogous effects on the interpretation of ambiguous information about a person. Participants received a behavioral passage about a person named Donald that was ambiguous with regard to hostility. The passage also included a metaphor which described Donald. The metaphor either implied hostility (Donald is a pit-bull, Donald is a Nazi) or was neutral (Donald is a bird). The serial position of the metaphor was also manipulated, with the metaphor either coming at the beginning or at the end of the passage. Participants then rated Donald and his behaviors along a series of trait dimensions. Results showed that participants rated Donalds behaviors to be significantly more hostile when the metaphor implied hostility and when it came before the ambiguous paragraph rather than after (B = -0.570, p = 0.04), suggesting that metaphors act as an expectancy or frame that guides the processing and interpretation of subsequently presented information."

It draws from extant research on metaphors of the field in organizational communication and organizational studies to argue that macro phenomena such as institutions, regimes, organizational sets, and markets call for new ways of thinking about organizational communication work. It moves away from treating institutions as entities or as networks of organizations to conceptualize institutional practices and discursive constructions in dynamic ways that interface with organizing through a myriad of macro practices and forms."

College students responses to different types of fear messages used in anti-methamphetamine PSAs (health, social dysfunction, psychological, and appearance damage threats) as well as responses to social normative messages were examined. Prior research suggests that different cognitive and emotional processes may underlie different types of comparative judgments of effects on self and others (3P: self less affected than average person; No Difference: self = average person; and 1P: self more affected than average person). Therefore, the relationships between individuals emotional responses and perceptions of PSA quality and credibility and judgment type were examined. In order to determine whether evaluations of message effects made while viewing are related to post-viewing judgments, continuous responses measures of message effects on self or on the average person were compared to post-viewing types judgments. A mixed 2 Continuous Response Target (Self/Average Person) X 3 Post-Viewing Judgment Type (Third Person, No Difference, First Person) X 6 (Appeal Type) design with the between subjects factors of Target and Judgment Type and the within subjects factor of Appeal Type was used. Order of PSA presentation was varied between data collection sessions."

Reflexivity is used for approaching and understanding the challenges of using Grounded Theory to collect qualitative data through an ethnographic inspired approach. Although analytical guidelines utilizing Grounded Theory is well documented, its use in practice is not well covered. Methodological Emotional Reflexivity (MER) is introduced as a tool for becoming aware of how different emotions emerging continuously at different points in the research, is related to or emerge as a consequence of specific encounters in the research context, augmenting an adaptive research design. Acknowledging that data collection in complex work settings is highly emotional in nature provides the researcher with an understanding of how the emotional field between the researcher and the respondents are continuously co-constructed and in flux requiring an adaptive research design. MER is considered one important tool for becoming more adaptive conducting research in practice using Grounded Theory."
2008-0832,Methodologies for Exploring the Political Spaces on the Internet: The Role of Mailing Lists Within Political Communities,Methodological Advances in Communication Technology Research,,,,Paper,Methodologies for Exploring the Political Spaces on the Internet: The Role of Mailing Lists Within Political Communities,Methodological Advances in Communication Technology Research,"Today, researchers of the digital age have looked at the role played by the Internet in creating new spaces for political participation. The aim of these researchers is mainly to understand how new technologies are used by transnational social movements. This has been done using different empirical tools such as web sites analysis (Norris, 2001; Della Porta and Mosca, 2005), hyperlink analysis (Van Aelst and Walgrave, 2004) and issue crawling (Rogers, 2001). While these methodologies differ by the goals for which they are used, they have a common point. They explore only the WWW.

The question arises: In order to understand how the Internet creates new spaces of political debate, is analysis of the WWW enough?

Despite its importance, I argue that this approach is not sufficient. The WWW shows the finalized political debate, but it is not able to provide details on how this political debate is developed within the political community. The net also has an important role in these dynamics, connecting often transnational and heterogenic subjectivities, but this happens throughout other digital instruments, such as mailing lists. I argue that researchers have to focus their analysis on these latter instruments.

In order to support my argument, my paper explores an extensive analysis on the role played by the net in organizing the G8 of Genoa, in 2001, run by the research group in which I took part at the University La Sapienza in Rome."

And while there are plenty of studies on public wikis, very little research on corporate wikis exists. We present an in-depth case study based on our unrestricted access to such a corporate wiki, thereby demonstrating a general analytical methodology. Our research approach rests on the notion that organizations are networks of communication. Therefore, we perceive wikis as two-layer networks of actors and documents which intersect at conversation and text. We propose and apply genres of as well as functional roles in organizational communication as qualitative filters to descriptive statistics and social network measures. In addition, we introduce the quantitative concept of interlocking to scale up from single communication events to collaboration as we find it corporate wikis. Among other things, our findings highlight the conflict between formal and informal organizational structures by example of project managers versus interns."

The second section of this essay asks whether art?s seemingly beneficent relationship to social change, as described by Adorno, functions as the fantasmatic support of the status quo by postulating mimetic experience as a kind of supplementary corrective to the experience of diremption in the social. In short, I attempt to develop a way to complicate Adorno?s notion of mimesis by supplementing it with a psychoanalytic approach to subject-object assimilation, so that it can offer an analytic paradigm for discerning different ways in which a subject can assimilate to an object?ways that may not fall neatly into the field of the experience of art works as Adorno understands it. The third section of this essay will turn to a case study of a recent phenomenon called ?Alternate Reality Gaming,? where I will ask if the construction of a ?hive mind,? or collective intelligence around the collaborative production of a dramatic narrative can be understood through the lens of mimetic experience, and also whether Alternate Reality Games, which are equal parts viral marketing campaigns, role playing games and collaborative dramatic performances, can function as objects that are capable of a politically productive mimetic experience."

However the process of appropriation does not occur in isolation. It is influenced, for example, by the state of existing technology, the knowledge, skills and needs of users, and the types of services offered by network providers. Furthermore, telecommunications network providers also engage in appropriations of their own (Bar, Pisani & Weber, 2007). Based on in-depth interviews, surveys and observations, this paper examines the deployment and use of mobile phone services in Ghana. It discusses how technology appropriation occurs in a cycle of interaction between network providers, industry intermediaries and end-users. This is an important aspect of how particular social practices emerge and disappear around the mobile telephony, and is important to understand because of the layer of unpredictability it contributes to the use environment."
2008-0837,Mind the Gap: The Shifting Fortunes of Small and Microscale Intermediaries in the Mobile Phone Industry,The Social Impact of Networking the Poor for Development,,,,Paper,Mind the Gap: The Shifting Fortunes of Small and Microscale Intermediaries in the Mobile Phone Industry,The Social Impact of Networking the Poor for Development,"A distinctive characteristic of mobile telephony in most developing countries is a highly fragmented structure with an extensive layer of micro-entrepreneurs bridging the gap between network providers and end-users. These intermediaries eke out a living breaking mobile telephony into the smallest possible units and bringing it as close as possible to low-income consumers. Whether dealing in used handsets, accessories, or prepaid airtime, they play a critical role in filling a gap that larger organizations are unable or unprepared to fill. They are however vulnerable to changes in the market that may render them redundant. This paper examines the evolution of the mobile phone industry in Ghana from a highly centralized into a highly fragmented structure. Conditions contributing to this process are elaborated and the implications for micro-entrepreneurial livelihoods in a constantly changing technological industry are considered."

The most significant finding of this study confirms the existence of a SES based knowledge gap on obesity related health risks. Personal relevance and community involvement met with mixed results, with only community involvement appearing to be an independent indicator of knowledge on health-risk issues (supporting the hypothesis). Given the disproportionate disease-risk burden that racial/ethnic minority groups carry with regards to obesity, the study attempted to use race as formulation of community boundedness to explore knowledge gaps on obesity. However this hypothesis was not supported."
2008-0839,Minority Programming: Still at the Back of the Bus,Media Spectacles of Race,,,,Paper,Minority Programming: Still at the Back of the Bus,Media Spectacles of Race,"This paper examines the issue of minority-targeted programming on broadcast and cable television. It shows that minority owned programming is getting little carriage and that minority-targeted programming is still at the back of the bus  severely underrepresented in carriage compared to the size of the minority population and relegated to expensive tiers on cable networks.

The paper first reviews the FCCs analysis of the availability and ratings of video programming and shows that it suggests that where cable networks are placed may be an important factor in determining their performance.

To explore this issue, a database on the carriage of minority-targeted program was built for July 2007. We identified the top fifty markets, which account for approximately three quarters of the Blacks and Hispanics. We then obtained data on the carriage of minority-targeted programming by the largest cable operator in each of those markets.

 Although the 192 minority-targeted represent about 40% of the total number of network, they account for only 8.4% of the total carriage and minority-owned, minority-targeted programming accounts for less than 4%.
 The most broadly available programming is dominated by a handful of programmers. Four-fifths of the carriage on expanded basic tiers is accounted for by five networks  two of which are owned by broadcasters (Univision and Telemundo (owned by NBC)) and one owned by a cable programmer (Viacom).
 In order to gain access to 98 percent of the minority-targeted networks, subscribers must pay for extra tiers  an average of almost $43 per month."

By running a between-subjects experiment (N=84), this study manipulated emotional bandwidth, conceptualized as the ability to selectively present ones affective state via CMC features, and examined its effects on social support and liking. Results indicate that social support is most likely to be perceived and viewed as appropriate on profiles with low emotional bandwidth, suggesting that intensity of emotional bandwidth is not equal to quality and that CMC features should be used judiciously. Design implications for effective use of online social networks are discussed."

When the proportions of ethnicity and gender from the news coverage of five national television stations between 2005 and 2006 were compared to official missing children statistics, it was found that African American missing children and female missing children were significantly underrepresented in television news coverage. It is argued that such things as newsroom diversity, news operation routines, media ownership, and commercial motives of media contribute to the race and gender related media bias."

Findings indicate that journalists at both Black and mainstream media overlooked missing Black women, while they often objectified missing White women. Additionally, mainstream media relied on a patriarchal representation of the world that values women based on looks and body size. It is imperative to question how reporters present information to the public because news coverage of issues often sets the tone for how audiences perceive them."

To this end, parent-child dyads were assigned randomly to one of three conditions: no mediation control, realism active mediation, or desirability active mediation. Parents then were trained to administer their respective mediation strategies in their homes for a week. At the end of the week, the children were brought back to view and provide their reactions to a series of commercials.
It was found that desirability mediation and concept-oriented communication are ways for parents to reduce the unintended negative effects of advertising on young children. Furthermore, training parents to deliver mediation strategies designed to alter the perceptions of character desirability was effective. Future research should consider ways to refine parent training sessions and desirability mediation messages in order to provide parents with practical advice."

The expectation was that the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission and then the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation would supply a sufficient sense of national consciousnessand national unity to counter the perceived threat of American broadcasting. Other factors, however, contributed the preservation of a national consciousness. Language presented a barrier to the wholesale adoption of American programming, despite the presence of two American affiliates in the city. The CBC, itself, was a carrier of American network programs making its impact mixed with regard to the safeguarding of a sense of Canadian nationalism. This unique combination of factors are explored here through a content analysis of radio program schedules in Montreal from 1930 to 1939, which reveals that the CBC was but one of three different networks whose establishment coincided with increased levels of American content in the Montreal radio schedule."
2008-0845,Mobile Instruction Technologies and the Culture of Education: An Empirical Study on the Appropriation of iPods,formation Technology In (and Out of) the Classroom,,,,Paper,Mobile Instruction Technologies and the Culture of Education: An Empirical Study on the Appropriation of iPods,Information Technology In (and Out of) the Classroom,"Contemporary claims for the adoption of mobile information and communication technologies as learning & teaching devices are often based on two main theoretical perspectives: the socio-constructivist model of the teaching& learning process and the continuity pattern in education. These two theoretical approaches to education have constructed what may be considered a cultural model of education. This cultural model of education is largely shared by members of the scientific community. It also has nurtured common educational practices and seems to be shared by people involved in the educational process: practitioners, administrators, teachers and students. The question remains: is this culture of education shared by all the actors involved in the learning process?
The relevance of this issue is crucial given it is exactly in the name of a socio-constructivist cultural model and in the name of a continuity pattern in education, that mobile learning & teaching devices are often adopted or strongly recommended in schools and universities.
Assuming that different and often conflicting operating cultures may converge in an educational setting, we empirically investigated the cultural dimensions of the adoption of iPods as a learning/teaching tool. Reporting and analysing some results of the study, this paper argues that the culture of education underlying the adoption of iPods is not necessarily part of the students cultural model of academic education. By investigating this cultural gap, our research strongly underlines that successful adoption of mobile instructional devices does not depend only on technological opportunities or in teachers skills in changing their educational practices. Rather, it depends also on the integration of the technologies into the specific cultural frames by which students live their academic life."

It explores issues such as cloned cell phones and cell phone theft in a community in which the price of the device still matters, and cell phones still represent social status. Furthermore, the paper investigates to what degree the increasing pervasiveness of cell phones in that country transforms them into social collective technologies. Community members tell how they share their cell phone among the community, transforming it almost into a public pay phone. Finally, the paper argues that the initial idea of the digital divide should be redefined when cell phones replace not only landlines, but also, potentially, personal computers."

Users innovate by shaping the technology they adopt to make it their own and by transforming their practices around its possibilities, thus deeply altering social spaces. The paper lays out a theoretical framework that views the appropriation process as the re-negotiation of power relationships between producers and users. It applies this framework to cases of mobile telephony appropriation in the developing world (mobile banking in Eastern Africa, motorcycle courier services in São Paulo) and at the margins of the developed world (such as the new social and spatial mappings created by handicapped people in Barcelona or Day Laborers in Los Angeles through their cell phone use.) The analysis suggests important lessons for the design of technology products and services, as well as for programs seeking to harness them for socio-economic development."

A neural network model can simulate the neurons of the brain with connection and activation strength and may be programmed to remember or recall an input with similar probability to that of a real human. The dynamic, embodied, limited-capacity attention and memory model has been tested and supported with data simulated to be a real-life participant. In this study the model is being tested against actual data obtained from participants who viewed pleasant and unpleasant television scenes varying along a continuum of arousal. The goal is to see whether the model can also accurately predict the memory patterns of humans. Data was collected from participants who watched television clips and indicated their self-reported arousal and valence and then took a recall memory test and a signal detection recognition memory test for information in the clips."

Descriptive public opinion polls conducted overseas showed a generally negative attitude of Muslim populations abroad toward the U.S.-led war on terror. In order to truly determine what international communication strategies need to be adopted by the U.S. to gain the support of global audiences for the war on terror, researchers need to first understand the schema associated with this war as present in the minds of Muslim individuals living abroad. The data used in this paper is drawn from large-scale public opinion surveys conducted in seven countries with substantial Muslim populations. This paper uses theory-driven structural equation modeling techniques and presents a model of schema structure containing interrelated factors, including media exposure, that account for the variation of individuals likelihood to support the U.S.-led war on terror. By quantitatively illustrating the schema associated with the U.S.-led war on terror, this paper proposes an empirically-driven model of international public opinion formation that illustrates the role that news and entertainment media play in affecting such opinion. Implications are drawn for U.S. international political communication strategies."

The news story used in the experiment mentioned the information about immigration increase in Spain by highlighting a) the positive (economic contribution frame) vs. negative (crime growth frame) consequences; and, b) information about the origin of the immigrants (group cue) in the news story (Latinos vs. Moroccans). The results showed that the type of stressed news frame in the report exerted significant socio-cognitive effects. A differential effect in terms of group cue is also observed. It is concluded that framing effect can be conceptualized as a process ruled by heuristic application that guides information processing based on the peripheral cues in it."

Using NES 2004 data and multivariate analysis, the results suggest that some routine issues, such as the job and standard living issues, were viewed as salient because the individuals pertinence for and involvement in them keep the issue in their central information-processing route, regardless of the media coverages intensity on the issue. The study implies that individuals responsibility of thinking is also related to the perceived salience of the issue."

The essay argues that citizen critics offered whites mythic discourse to deflect racist accusations and blame blacks for structural problems, concealing political advantages and white privilege. The structural features of this mythic discourse are (1) the purified scene, (2) individualistic heroes, and (3) institutional enemies. This study suggests that future research should explain how archetypes rebirth are used to provide a deterministic history of U.S. race relations, and disclose the limitations of individualism to solve racism, segregation, poverty and hate crimes."

Shoemaker and Reeses (1991) theories of media content influences suggest that a newspapers gatekeepers and internal organizational pressures affect a publication. A content analysis of a convenience sample of section front pages in print and online found that at least half had one picture in both media, and it was the same picture 63% of the time. This pilot study found that the print edition ran far more pictures overall, and the data suggest a strong influence of templates in photo use in online editions."

Previous examinations of the impacts of political comedy on political knowledge, perceptions of government institutions and leaders, opinion formation, and information seeking behavior often present contradictory findings. This research uses data from an experimental study conducted with undergraduates at a major Midwestern university (n=332) exposed to varying news and comedy video content in the spring of 2007. Our findings suggest that exposure to political comedy positively influences information seeking behavior among those with higher levels of political interest. Additionally, we suggest that an examination of the political outcomes of exposure and attention to political comedy must work to incorporate any mediating effects of individual level partisanship on program perceptions. Implications for future research on the effects of political comedy are discussed."

Ive Seen That on a Commercial!: U.S. Preschoolers Recognition of Brand Logos,"Advertising, Children, and Adolescents: Content and Concerns","Using multiple methods, we tested 3- to 5-year-old childrens recognition of U.S. commercial logos. We began with a focus group of mothers, followed by a walk through a local store, interviews with children, and a two-week media diary. Results indicate that while preschoolers may not know the brand name, they often know the product associated with a logo when it is shown to them. The recognition of logos by name did not follow the order of advertising spending by these companies. When shopping, children often reached and pointed toward products at their level. As they recognize brands or products, children often comment on their associations with that product. The media diaries revealed a variety of programming choices for preschoolers. Future study is needed to further examine preschoolers exposure to and recognition of heavily advertised commercial products."

This statement is embodied by and correlates with the two main kinds of resources defined in theories of resource mobilization. This study explores how an activist organization, MoveOn.org, is using the Internet as a public relations tool to engage in resource mobilization of money and people, known in the literature as tangible and intangible resources. MoveOn.orgs Web site and action alerts were analyzed for tangible, intangible and coalition building mobilization features. Results show that MoveOn engaged in resource mobilization more heavily in its action alerts and in Web pages specific to unique campaigns. Overall, the data suggests that MoveOn engages in resource mobilization in ways unique to completely virtual or online organizations, and exhibiting resource mobilization tactics that can be characterized as progressive based on levels of involvement and layers into its Web site. Further, the disproportion of mobilization features in pages and e-mails linked to specific issues, candidates, or advertisements suggests that effective and strategic resource mobilization is hinged on connecting mobilization features to outcomes or issues rather than to the general entity of an activist organization."

Taking A Look Backat a Peculiar Report",Histories of the Field of Communication,"Montreal, September 1968, a special Unesco round table is held on mass media and culture. It took three years before Unesco decide to release the document entitled Essais sur les mass media et la culture. The round table was held a year before the well-known Montreal Meeting of Experts and since 1969, it literally disappeared from the literature in international communication research. As a matter of fact, this author has not been able to find any reference to the Essais, in French or in English. Still, some of the participants were then celebrities: Edgar Morin, Stuart Hall, Pierre Schaeffer.

Who bears the responsibility to solve it? Do we have a moral responsibility to our natural world? If so, from where does it arise?

As climate change becomes more urgent, religious leaders search theology for answers. Their answers (interpretations) have led to three primary types of discourses:

 Intra-faith Discussion
o Monotheistic Faiths
o Polytheistic Faiths
o Indigenous Faiths
 Discussion between religious and scientific leaders
 Discussion between leaders of monotheistic religious, typically tied to land owning cultures, and indigenous spiritual leaders, typically tied to land-worshipping cultures

This presentation will outline these discourses, as well as the debate on the role of a humanistic moral authority, such as that which underpins the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The presentation will conclude with common ground principles upon which universal policy on climate change could be built."

But Keisker was much more than secretary; she had a vibrant career in broadcasting, made inroads for women in a male-dominated media industry, and became an activist in the burgeoning womens rights movement. Keisker is notably left out of the radio history literature, and in this paper I seek to recuperate her contributions and add to the growing field of cultural histories of media. I have culled historical documents to put together a sketch of Keiskers career and to analyze in-depth a particularly illuminating radio interview she conducted as Kitty Kelly in the late 1940s. This was her first major role in radio, on WREC-Memphis, and it is here where she developed her voice as radio announcer and began to challenge, both implicitly and explicitly, gender roles of the U.S. mid-Twentieth Century."
2008-0861,More Than Wishful Thinking: Causes and Consequences of Voters Expectations About Election Outcomes,Voting and Deliberation,,,,Paper,More Than Wishful Thinking: Causes and Consequences of Voters Expectations About Election Outcomes,Voting and Deliberation,"The assumption that voters form accurate expectations about the outcome of elections plays a central role in psychological and economic theories of voting. Some dismiss these expectations as preference-driven wishful thinking, while others believe that these perceptions, for example aided by exit polls, exert nefarious influences on voting behavior. In the paper, three questions about voters expectations are investigated. First, several factors that influence the overall accuracy or quality of voters expectations are identified and tested. Second, the phenomenon of wishful thinking is tested and confirmed for expectations about the electoral performance of individual parties and coalitions. Finally, two mechanisms how expectations might influence voting behavior are identified and tested. Based on surveys from Austria and Germany, the results suggest that voters not only rely on expectations to avoid casting wasted votes for parties without electoral chances, but that they are able to engage in fairly sophisticated strategic coalition voting, given the appropriate circumstances and a high level of political knowledge. Voters with a low level of political knowledge are found to be susceptible to a bandwagon effect. Overall, the results suggest that voters expectations play an important role in political decision making."

The long-held ideology of the good mother paints a portrait of an all-patient, all-loving, and ever-present mother whose child always comes first. By necessity or desire, however, a majority of American mothers work outside of the home. This study examines how dichotomous constructions and competing ideologies of contemporary motherhood are made visible and (re)enforced in news media. Using a discourse analysis, we examine three mid-sized daily newspapers, to identify thematic structures framing contemporary motherhood. Four main themes (self-sacrifice, opting out, work at home and a no-win situation) organize and give meaning to womens choices and circumstances as mothers. Ultimately, they serve to isolate mothers and judge their life experiences."

Participants were 206 college students who were not currently residing with their mothers. Results of hierarchical multiple regressions revealed mothers affirming communicator style was the best predictor of young adult childrens communication initiation and avoidance. Reconsideration of past research and the present studys findings yield mixed success for extrapolating IAT, with support for young adult childrens adaptation to satisfy basic requirements for protection, but no support for adaptation to satisfy desires for a close relationship with mothers. Continued exploration of IAT in existing relationships and with regard to negative relational events is encouraged."

This research evaluated both basic use and design tenets and the presence of theoretical components to motivate healthy breast cancer behavior for users of the most frequented breast cancer websites. Methodology: Each website was evaluated with two sets of questions. The first attends to the basic use and design tenets of the website. The second coding form assessed the websites use of three behavior change theories. Results: The majority of the websites fared well with regards to their use of basic tenet and design principles. Theoretical components were used sparingly on the majority of websites. Discussion: The most frequented breast cancer websites are currently well equipped with basic use and design tenets. However, their lack of behavioral change components is likely to impede users motivations to protect themselves against breast cancer."

The three motivational input variables (arousing content, positivity, and negativity) and the five output variables (heart rate, skin conductance level, corrugator activity, zygomatic activity, and channel choices) were selected based on extensive previous theoretical and empirical research.
In general, the findings of the dynamic time series modeling approach are consistent with a voluminous previous literature using traditional statistic methods, such as a robust quadratic effect of arousing content on the dependent variables. However, this study makes three primary theoretical and empirical contributions that extend previous work: First, it estimates the effects of motivational inputs per unit time (i.e., unconfounded with duration of input), including an especially interesting coactivation statethe interaction between positivity and negativity; second, it explores the dynamical effects of motivational variables and in fact found significant order one and order two feedback effects of the physiological systems, and; third, it explores media viewing and choice behavior in the framework of motivational activation and connects the behavior with physiological responses using dynamic time series models."

A large body of research suggests human emotions are organized around two basic motivational systems: the appetitive system and the aversive system (P.J. Lang, Bradley & Cuthbert, 1997). It has also been suggested that these two systems are separate, and do not always work reciprocally (Cacioppo & Gardner, 1999).
Based on this view of emotion, this study explored the variation in the activation of the appetitive and aversive motivational systems as a function of threat types in the context of video game play. One interesting notion that came from Cacioppo and his colleagues is the state of coactivation, where both motivational systems are activated at the same time. Relatively little work has been done around this idea in psychology, and communication scholars have just started to study the effect of coactivation on information processing (e.g., Lang & Sanders-Jackson, 2006)
This study used a custom-built video game to manipulate the subjects motivational system activation to compare three different motivational states: appetitive, aversive, and coactive. Predictions for information processing were made based on the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP, Lang 2006a, 2006b). The manipulation of the targeted motivational systems was successful, and the data found general support for the theory. Overall, the findings from this study provide insight to the relationship between motivational system activation and information processing."

The purpose of this study was to explore the motives for using social network sites, social relationships created and sustained via social network sites, and effects of the identified motivations to these social relationships, in two different cultures: the United States and Korea. Reflecting the cultural orientations of the two countries (the collectivistic and high-context Korean culture and the individualistic and low-context American culture), findings of this study show that social bonding is closely linked to the use of social network sites in Korea, whereas border-crossing bridging is more relevant to Americans use of social network sites."

This extension focused on examining how strength of communication ties and task interdependence function as motivating factors influencing to what extent knowing who knows what can be brought to bear on actual expertise exchange among group members. Using data collected from 218 individuals from 18 real organizational groups, the proposed model was tested using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis techniques. The results provided strong support for our revised model. Specially, we found that the relationship between knowing who knows what and expertise exchange  the basic premise of the original transactive memory theory - was mediated by strength of communication ties and moderated by task interdependence. The analysis also showed strong contextual influence of group-level variables on individual-level outcomes such that expertise exchange happened more frequently in groups with well-developed transactive memory systems, and higher average strength of communication ties and task interdependence."

Of particular interest is the standardization of the listening test as a procedure for determining the sonic quality of recorded material. The engineers who worked on the format began with frequency models derived from psychoacoustics textbooks but quickly modified them based on the results of listening test. But the listening test itself privileged particular kinds of musical experience, and particular modes of studying hearing. In part, the history of the listening test shows how private experience must be rendered measurable to enter into technical discourse; but it also shows the degree to which timbre has came to be the preeminent aesthetic dimension of musical analysis for the design of sound technologies in the late 20th century.

Textual analysis of top two circulating daily newspapers in Bulgaria was used to examine how female politicians were portrayed during the 2005 parliamentary elections. The analysis unequivocally indicates that press coverage of female politicians is refracted through the prism of gender stereotypes, which, in turn, exhibit signs of the post-communist masculinization of democracy. What is more, this study found that women politicians and well as the female reporters who cover them willingly partake in the gendered mediation of the Bulgarian female politicians, therefore acting, as Julia Kristeva argued, the strongest supporters of the existing, albeit oppressive, social order. The overall conclusion is that gendered media portrayals of female politicians lead to the creation of a social climate tolerant towards and in fact, encouraging, of sexism in all aspects of life."

What we learned from conversation analysis and pragmatics is that the definition of what is performed in interaction is something that is always negotiable between interactantsin action and reaction, as Weigand (2002) noted insightfully. But I would like to claim that we could even go further in this reflection by showing that the question of who or even what is acting is debatable, for many different types of actants (such as utterances, emotions, collectives, principles, or rules) can be identified as doing something in a given discussion. Opening up the interactional scene in this way thus allows us to free it, so to speak, by showing that many different things do things with words. Interestingly, this way of dislocating the interactional scene also enables us to address more thoroughly the question of power and authority, a question that tends to be relatively downplayed by analysts of interaction. Showing that several types of actants can be actively and rhetorically mobilized in a given interaction allows us to account for phenomena of ventriloquism. That is, the mobilization of particular actants allows human interactants to make certain entities (collectives, procedures, policies, ideologies, etc.) speak in their nameand vice versa."

It is found that the combined impacts of genre proximity and cultural proximity result in the initial success of American Internet companies at the early stage of China Internet development as well as their predicament at the later stage. Modernity proximity emerges as a new concept to mediate the operations of both genre proximity and cultural proximity, and constitute, by itself, an important component of multiple proximities theory."

Participants completed cognitive tests of executive control (Trail Making Test B), working memory (Letter Memory Test) and visual working memory (Reverse Span Board Test) before and after engaging in a multitasking environment or a serial task environment. Participants in the multitasking condition wrote an essay, created a music play list and chatted with a confederate simultaneously for thirty minutes (N = 12), while those in the serial task condition performed each of the same tasks one at a time, spending 10 minutes on each task (N = 11). Repeated measures analyses indicated that participants in the multitasking condition showed poorer performance on a visual working memory test than participants in the serial condition. Working memory and executive control were not affected by the multitasking or serial task environment."

The development of social networks to create and promote taste cultures, the ability to search globally and historically for music tracks, the cultural production of niche musics, and the rise of the 'shuffle effect' or a preference for individual  tracks over album formats are mechanisms of operation that have significant implications for the constitution of  subjectivity. Music acquisition and consumption play a role in the social construction of subjectivity, as music relates individuals to their social environment. Digital music facilitates different relationships to personal soundscapes, and therefore different way of constructing social environments. This research surveyed young people of their modes of music acquisition, and interviewed them on the digital and physical music products they had acquired, the ways they used their music products and the meanings of these in their lives. The results suggest new ways of thinking about music use, and changing social functions of music consumption.

The paper argues that digital files require a re-thinking of practices related to music marketing and discovery and that, as digital files are ripped from CDs, they undergo a kind of re-packaging. Whereas Napster often hogs the spotlight in discussions of digital music, the importance of software like Winamp and databases like the CDDB is barely mentioned, despite the hand they had in fostering a new environment within which the music commodity could exist. Winamp and the CDDBs place within early listener/user experiences of music on computers can be seen as critical developments in the commodification of digital music.

The store is situated in a colorful old house, and has been a staple of the local community for 36 years. While many small independent record stores are closing around the country, the economic future of The House of Records is precarious as it struggles to compete with a variety of social forces (mainly from the corporate hegemony of chain stores, the prevalence of digital downloading, and CD piracy.) This ethnographic project explores the independent spirit of the employees and customers associated with the store and how they actively articulate a variety of cultural meanings in terms of cultural resistance, community, and subcultural identity formation. At the heart of this resistance is a desire for independence, locality and cultural diversity."

Performing a meta-analysis of hip hop studies in communications research, this paper explores the construction of the Black female as audienceimagined or real. Findings show researchers recuperate the trope of silence/voice prevalent in Black women's scholarship, depict the Black female audience as engaged practitioners or as a vulnerable group, and reify the moral panic surrounding Black female sexuality.

This study applied prospect theory to examine how message frames that focus on the possible survival or death of a potential organ transplant recipient affect participants' willingness to become organ donors. Perceived personal risk and ambivalence were examined as moderating variables. Results indicate that risk, rather than ambivalence, played an instrumental role in participants' decisions to donate. Although no main effects or interactions related to message frame emerged in initial analyses, a supplemental analysis revealed a modest persuasive advantage for the loss-framed message among low-risk participants. Additional analyses revealed that for low-risk participants, perceived benefits of organ donation were higher for the loss frame than the gain frame, whereas the opposite pattern was found for high-risk participants. Findings suggest that decisions about organ donation may be associated with unique responses to message frames."

The primary aim of this article is to analyze the complex and diverse ways in which Japanese youths engage with SNS in everyday life, understanding and bringing together audience activities under the concept of audience engagement. Further, the analysis of the Japanese audience can serve as a modest step towards the internationalization of media studies. In the process, some Japanese emic concepts are employed, adapting them in ways that reject as myth the homogeneity of the Japanese, in order to highlight culturally specific ways of constructing self and other. Among various kinds of SNS in Japan, Mixi has become the most popular SNS and it had more than 10 million users in May 2007. Japanese young people have begun to use Mixi via mobile phone rather than PC. While MySpace has 200 million accounts all over the world, MySpace Japan has only 1 million unique users. MySpace has been straggling to enter the Japanese market. Recently MySpace Japan has made their design and form de-Americanised, according to their glocal strategy and MySpace Mobile has also started only inside of Japan. I investigate the social and cultural role of Mixi and MySpace in the Japanese society through qualitative research using in-depth interview and participant observation.

How accurately do partisans in this debate perceive the attitudes and beliefs of their adversaries? As in other contentious debates over social issues, partisans in the CI debate seem to share the perception that there is an unbridgeable gap between themselves and the other side. The reported research explored the possibility that CI proponents and opponents exhibit naïve realism (Ross & Ward, 1996) in their perceptions of the relationship between their own attitudes and those of their adversaries. Specifically, it was hypothesized that partisans would tend to equate their own point of view with rationality and morality, and their adversaries perspective as less rational and more prone to ideological bias. It was also hypothesized that partisans would perceive the attitudinal gap between the sides as larger than self-reported attitudes appear to indicate, a phenomenon known as false polarization (Sherman, Nelson, & Ross, 2005). A survey of CI proponents and opponents provided strong evidence supporting these hypotheses. Respondents tended to overestimate the gap in partisans sympathy for the parents and child involved in a hypothetical CI decision scenario, as well as the influence that ethical and moral beliefs played in partisans evaluation of the scenario. These findings suggest that the CI debate is predicated not only on genuine attitudinal differences between partisans, but also on exaggerated and self-serving perceptions each side forms of their adversaries."

This study takes a communicative approach to understanding African American womens perceptions of cancer and breast cancer. Specifically, the study conceptualizes communication in this context as the relation of meanings experienced by individuals to understand cancer and breast cancer risks. Utilizing data from focus group interviews of 49 African American women, the current study applies problematic integration theory as an interpretive lens for understanding the uncertainty and fears associated with talking about cancer and breast cancer. The study highlights the dimensions of the problematic acknowledgement of cancer and breast cancer in everyday life for these African American women to identify several clear and important practical implications for understanding cultural dimensions to cancer communication among African American women."

The results identify a major cross-cultural stereotype in the immediate coverage of the terrorist acts: Journalists rushed to name the suspects al Qadea connection. Most of the newspapers used largely ambiguous quotes to speculate about the suspects. British officials later found that the suspects were homegrown and had no al Qadea connection. The priming effect priming is thus evident among the journalists who reported the event as breaking news. This study expands the research of pack journalism, which can become a cross-cultural phenomenon in the digital age. It also suggests that mass medias portrayal of terrorist acts could easily become stereotypical."

In the digital realm, authorship is dispersed, collaborative, and unstable. Instead of issuing from the labor of a single author, the story emerges from the encounter between designer-writers, programmers, users, and the computer itself. The resulting collaboration is so many-sided and shifting that it is no longer clear who is telling the story. Moreover, the reader does not passively receive the text but aggressively intervenes in both the form and content of the story, changing it in major ways.
Coming from the world of traditional narrative we may be hard put to see how story is at all possible in light of these modifications. How can we have a coherent story if the authorship is shared, if the plot is open-ended, if the story itself incorporates physical and spatial play? The paper will suggest that in digital narrative the reader/user/player takes over some of the functions of the author. The user's playful engagement with the digital environment creates the sense of mastery and commitment that makes for a coherent narrative. These new roles for author and reader are responses to profound changes in the concept of individuality, identity, and community in our global world."

Integrating Competing Concepts to Explain News Processing,,,,Paper,Narrativity as a latent pattern in the construction of news. A survey among journalists,News Between Narrativity and News Value. Integrating Competing Concepts to Explain News Processing,"It is trivial to say that almost any news item in any medium is a story. By selecting and interpreting events, putting them in a specific order and attributing causality, journalists produce stories. But not all news stories are good stories. This distinction reflects different notions of narrative. A common view on narrative defines it as a sequence of events connected by temporality and causality. In this case, a text either is or is not a narrative. A different view suggests that narrativity is not a dichotomous, but continuous attribute that can be found in almost any text  but to a varying degree.

Based on this concept of narrativity from structualist narratology, we define narrativity as the presence and interaction of textual elements that constitute the narrative richness of a text and its potential to create a vivid mental represent¬a¬tion of the story. To identify these textual elements we integrate the theoretical work of structuralist narratologists to obtain a coherent list of narrativity factors (i.e., conflict, clear structure, affective structure, emotion, dramatic mode). A study is presented that investigates how narrativity factors affect daily routines in journalism. A survey was conducted among German and Austrian print journalists who evaluated the importance of narrativity factors, as compared to news factors. A main result is that narrativity was evaluated as more important than news values. Narrativity seems to be a pattern in news construction that is intuitively employed in journalism and might merit more attention from communication research."
2008-0887,"National Origin, Language, and Perceptions of ""Foreignness"" Among U.S. American Listeners","LSI Studies on Race, Identity, and Nationality",,,,Extended Abstract,"National Origin, Language, and Perceptions of ""Foreignness"" Among U.S. American Listeners","LSI Studies on Race, Identity, and Nationality","Although countless studies have mapped hearers' responses to speakers from around the world, few studies have made a systematic comparison of attitudes toward varieties of the worlds lingua franca: English. Because the widespread use of English is linked to globalization, a systematic comparison of attitudes may reveal important, global patterns that guide peoples responses. The study we will present is one in which U.S. American attitudes toward seven different varieties of world English are simultaneously assessed. The data will provide a valid basis for comparing numerous attitudes and will present an opportunity to explore possible extant patterning. Specifically, we hypothesize that, based on a globalized racial hierarchy, speakers from European nations will be rated most favorably on traits related to status and will also be perceived as the least foreign; speakers from Latin American and Asian nations will be rated least favorably on traits related to status and will also be perceived as the most foreign. Ratings on traits related to solidarity will most likely be mixed across the speakers."

K.",Global Communication and Social Change Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,"Nations, Cultures, and Corporate Social Responsibility: Communication Advocacy in a Diverse, Devolving U. K.",Global Communication and Social Change Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"Abstract
This paper discusses how British NGOs used a range of activist strategies to elicit greater corporate social responsibility (CSR) in support of U.K. regional and national cultures, culture-specific representations in electronic communication, and in particular, endangered genres in that country. It explores some of the prescient issues in this field and the .technological and industry changes that have catalyzed U.K. activists. Its primary focus is on the strategies and impact of NGO viewer and listener broadcasting advocacy groups, community media associations, coalitions, and informal groups that seek to advance indigenous culture and get government and media corporations to both respond to these stakeholders and commit to policy and regulatory changes. The chapter also references pressure group activities with respect to the current crisis in childrens television throughout the U.K.s nations. Particular emphasis will be placed on CSR structures and vehicles for cultural expression in Scotland, Wales, the North, and other underrepresented regions and on an examination of if, and how, political devolution is intertwined with cultural agendas."

A prominence score (representing placement, length, headline-size, graphics) and direction (favorable, unfavorable, or neutral) were assigned to each article and combined to yield a Media Vector for each city. Vectors ranged .034 to -.576; 21 indicated unfavorable warrantless wiretapping coverage. Two characteristic clusters were linked with coverage variations: Stakeholder (% families with children 15-19 yro.: r=.376; p=.042) and Vulnerability (violent crime rate: r=.429; p=.026; % unemployed: r=.492; p=.01). % unemployed was most significant (36.1% of variance). Unexpectedly, % unemployed was linked to more favorable coverage of warrantless wiretapping."

What is reported on a catastrophic event does not necessarily reflect all the facts or the reality. Today, as at the beginning of the last century, a news story is manufactured in a series of processes.
The last decades have seen different phases of environmental awareness and reactions to nature disasters. At the same time, media structures and media technology have changed greatly since the beginning of the 20th century. The paper traces these developments to the 2005 study of nine disasters in the Swiss press and explains the perception of them. We conclude that the influence of the media market, particularly the dynamics in media change, appears to be an important and increasing part of the growing attention to the issue of natural disasters around the world."

It focuses on the role of the television industry in challenging and changing the distance between the remote and proximate, the foreign and familiar. The emphasis is on the institutional processes that enable as well as circumscribe these sorts of presentations. At the core are economic collaborations for the making of television documentaries made by television practitioners of different nations/cultures. In this space of social and political communication the collaborating parties who are geographically, materially, and culturally distant from each other negotiate these distances, as well as the distances between the subjects being presented (the alien viewed) and their audience (the distant viewers).The method applied is participant observation. The focal point of this approach is on an annual event  The Israeli Forum of CoProductions  at which producers from different countries hammer out collaborations. Findings show that the interlocutors are designing the distance between the strange and familiar, the distant and near  challenging and changing it, while simultaneously preserving and perpetuating it."

The violence was brought to an end in May of 2001, with the Madurese ordered to apologize for past mistakes, in exchange for which they were allowed to begin a gradual process of return. This paper is part of a larger research project focusing on post-violent conflict communication between these two ethnic groups. Our specific focus here is on the claiming and communication of identity among the members of the two conflicting groups."

This paper examines how ethnic Volga Tatars currently living in the United States negotiate their ethnic identity through stance-taking in an online-forum discussion on Islam. By employing a socio-cultural linguistic approach to language, identity, and stance-taking and by utilizing as my analytical tools Goffmans (1981) theory of footing (with the emphasis on production formats) and Bakhtins (1981) notions of heteroglossia, double-voicing, and codeswitching, I will demonstrate how Tatars multiple stances toward Islam reflect their complex social history as Russias ethnic minority and Americas recent immigrants and sojourners. I propose that the varying degrees of loyalty that the forum members display toward Islam signal a non-monolithic nature of their ethnic identity."
2008-0894,Neoliberalism and Media Reform,Commodity Activism: A Cross-Divisional Roundtable,,,,Paper,Neoliberalism and Media Reform,Commodity Activism: A Cross-Divisional Roundtable,"Given the powerful corporate media lobby and its allies in Washington, the media reform movement faces imposing challenges. Branded as a fight against Big Media, the movement has brought together a variety of constituencies from crusaders against television indecency to those working for an open Internet. But within and across this movement, there are differing ideological positions regarding the role of government in media regulation. As marginalized constituencies stake out strategic positions in their fight for media reform, this paper considers conflicts within the movement, including, for example, those between internet activists supporting net-neutrality, cable access activists supporting local video franchising, and battles between consumer groups advocating à la carte cable pricing and communities of color opposing it. This paper illuminates how these positions support or critique a broader neoliberal economic, social and cultural politics, and examines the implications of neoliberal cooptation and capitulation within the media reform movement today."

There has been a serious concern about imbalanced flow of media products. Recent studies, however, reported a trend of increasing regional exchanges. The goal of this study was to examine the current structure of international film trade and to explore structural changes in international film trade market between 1996 and 2004. This paper analyzed global film trade data using social network analysis. Results suggest that the structure of global film trade became decentralized and denser over time. This study also found regionalization trend among countries to form cultural and regional blocs in trading their films. Countries that speak the same languages and/or that are located in the same geographical regions were found to trade films more frequently. The results supported the argument of increasing regionalization. Clustering around the same language was most intense among Spanish speaking countries. Regionalization in geographical sense was most prominent on the European continent."

However, more recently we have witnessed a rise in on-line multi-user virtual environments and 3D platforms, both for adults and children, which  because of the rapid development of graphic design  have really given life to the notion of virtual life. Built around a single case study of such platforms namely Runescape (which is predominantly a game), Actor Network Theory (Latour, 1987, 1988a, 1988b, 1993, 1996, 1998, 2005; Law and Hassard, 1999) is used in an analysis of both virtual words to problematize the notions of identity and subjectivity. This offers a counter-critique to those who have accused ANT of having no theory of the subject. It engages with what is ostensibly one of the most radical challenges of vitalism, namely what does it mean to be human? Hence, it revisits the problematic of human versus non-human actors and reconsiders the deep-seated resistance within the humanities and social sciences to the idea of technological agency."

The analysis of five cases collected through the systematic review method (SR) suggests that previous projects are not proximate to the prototype of the electronic commons, and that moving toward this ideal type involves more than the distribution of technology. The roles that the electronic commons can play for healthier communities to operate in a civil society context are discussed."

This study examined the use of a technology-mediated gaming system to educate Peruvian youth about sexual and reproductive health. Working in collaboration with an NGO, Instituto Peruano de Paternidad Responsable, 108 boys and 111 girls living in the barrios of Lima were randomly assigned to two conditions, an interactive computer-based multimedia game and a traditional board game. The research design consisted of pre- and post-intervention surveys. The study utilized social network analysis to include social influences in a mixed-influence model.
We find that the nature of the social link determined the extent to which ones associates could influence self knowledge and attitudes. In this particular case, advice networks were more influential than friendship networks."
2008-0899,Net Worth: Facebook Use and Changes in Social Capital Over Time,Technology and Social Capital,,,,Paper,Net Worth: Facebook Use and Changes in Social Capital Over Time,Technology and Social Capital,"Facebook is one of the largest social network sites and is widely used on college campuses. This paper builds upon earlier research which established a link between intensive Facebook use and bridging social capital, although the directionality of the relationship was unclear. Using longitudinal data, this paper provides preliminary evidence of a causal link between Facebook use and bridging social capita. We argue that bridging social capital, which is linked with the concept of weak ties, is especially important for individuals in the 18-25 year age range, and that the design of Facebook exposes individuals to those outside their close circle of friends. Although the high number of friends reported by many Facebook users would seem to suggest ephemeral and shallow relationships, we argue that this is in fact characteristic of a large, heterogeneous network  precisely the kind of network that supports the formation of bridging social capital."

This paper will critique two aspects of existing research on credibility within digital media environments  that credibility decisions are made in a highly rational and careful manner by individual users acting alone  in light of recent developments in cognitive theory and decision research, and in light of increasing social uses of the Internet. The paper will report on initial findings from a large-scale, two year research project on credibility and digital media funded by the MacArthur Foundation."
2008-0901,New Directions in Hybrid Popular Television: A Reassessment of Television Mock-Documentary,Hybrid Film Formats: East Meets West?,,,,Paper,New Directions in Hybrid Popular Television: A Reassessment of Television Mock-Documentary,Hybrid Film Formats: East Meets West?,"In the past few years the fake documentary or so-called mock-documentary, once an underground (film) genre, has gradually made its way into mainstream television production with notable examples like the highly acclaimed BBC-series The Office and Comedy Centrals Reno 911. These fictions that look and sound like documentaries have taken on a great appeal as reality television established itself as a staple aspect of contemporary television and popular culture. Elaborating mockumentary theory to the domain of television, this article argues against predominant notions of mock-documentary as parody, commentary or subversion, based on two Flemish cases of the form: Kaat & Co and Het Geslacht De Pauw (or The De Pauw Family). These particular instances of mock-documentary shed new light on the border genre and suggest that broader tendencies are at work in this kind of television programming. Through a comprehensive study of the Flemish cases, which combines a textual analysis and in-depth interviews with individuals who were involved in the production of the television shows, the article reconsiders the theorizing of mock-documentary, its aesthetic and cultural meaning and in so doing attempts to clarify that muddy area that lies between straightforward fictional and factual television output."

The production in question is the BBC Afghan Education Projects (BBC AEP) New Home, New Life soap opera, an innovative media intervention that has successfully combined humanitarian information and development themes with drama since 1993. The paper highlights two evaluation processes of importance to the sustainability of the production. First, how audience feedback, facilitated through evaluation, provides much of the dramatic raw material for the creative team working in Kabul, which in turn helps to ground the production in the actual problems experienced by the audience. Second, the role evaluation plays in terms of revealing the critical audience interpretations of New Home, New Lifes dramatic themes. Discussion reveals that such critical feedback further enhances the socio-cultural fit of the production and helps to strengthen its social realist values."
2008-0903,New Media and the News: Understanding Contemporary Journalism,Reimagining Structure and Agency,,,,Paper,New Media and the News: Understanding Contemporary Journalism,Reimagining Structure and Agency,"As audiences for paid-for mainstream newspapers keep shrinking and new media offer different means of communicating we face a critical moment in both the history of the newspaper and journalism theory. The nature of news and the nature of news production have changed massively over the last two decades. We have seen the globalization of news take hold, the concentration of ownership increase, and the widespread use of a range of new digital technologies. News research, however, has lagged desperately behind. This paper draws a theoretical bridge between macro-societal analyses of news media and micro-organisational approaches to understanding contemporary formations of news. It poses the questions: how can we understand news industries in the world of new media? Who are the journalists and how do they exert influence on one another? Does this influence support or challenge economic and/or regulatory constraints within newsrooms? If journalism is expanding in a manner that is irreducible to economic imperatives, national cultural ideologies or political constraints then how do the varieties of journalism respond to or resist such pressures and how do we begin to research them? This paper argues for a cross-disciplinary perspective to take account of the novel characteristics of new media and to open up the possibility of re-imagining journalism."
2008-0904,New Political Cyber-Associations: MoveOn.org as a Form of American Social Capital,Using Online Media for Civic Engagement,,,,Paper,New Political Cyber-Associations: MoveOn.org as a Form of American Social Capital,Using Online Media for Civic Engagement,"Once, political newspapers connected volunteer associations for face-to-face meetings; now, political websites connect busy citizens with easy-entry, easy action, and easy exit with a virtual association. Despite some scholars worry about a lessening of volunteerism and social capital, political websites as virtual organizations can be democratic examples of social capital for political and civic involvement. This paper analyzes textually the controversial Moveon.org website as a case study for examples of Putnams components of social capital: social connections, civic engagement and social trust during the 2005 fall, a period without presidential or congressional elections. MoveOns successes included inward social bonding for local candlelight vigils and outward bridging to other organizations for Hurricane Katrina relief for civic engagement and social trust. Not all of MoveOns efforts were successful: the attempts to censure the President and stop two of his Supreme Court nominations."
2008-0905,"New Politics, New Publics?",Reconfiguring the Public,,,,Paper,"New Politics, New Publics?",Reconfiguring the Public,"New media, it is claimed, has re-invented transnational activism. The Internet with its networked, additive, interactive and polycentric form can accommodate radically different types of political praxis from different places at different times. This new found means of political mobilization is challenging our understanding of the political public sphere, counter public spheres and, with it, our analyses of what constitutes democracy in a mediated world. To date, neo-Habermasian studies have considered the implications for a revision of the public sphere without necessarily extending this to a critique of the concept of democracy inherent within the public sphere thesis. This paper considers public-ness in the light of the possibilities of new media, reconsiderations of the public sphere, and claims for a new politics in the 21st century. The paper critiques the key concepts of participation, deliberation and democracy in Habermas public sphere thesis through an examination of the radical-pluralist, or agonistic, approach in the work of Chantal Mouffe, and the rhizomatic politics of Deleuze and Guattari and Hardt and Negri."

It is generally acknowledged that information relayed through the mass media plays a role in the formation of anti-immigration sentiments. The present study considers whether news coverage of ethnic minorities and immigration relates to over-time developments of anti-immigration sentiments. It furthermore tests whether this relationship depends on variation in relevant contextual factors. The models simultaneously control for the effects of established contextual explanatory factors. Drawing on monthly time-series data and on ARIMA time-series modeling techniques, it is shown that both the frequency and the tone of coverage of ethnic minorities significantly influence dynamics in anti-immigration sentiments. The effect of the news, however, depends on contextual variation in immigration or the number of asylum seekers. The consequences of these findings are discussed in the light of increasing successes of extreme right parties and growing opposition to further European integration."

In total, 89 news stories of anti-war coverage from 11 national news sources were analyzed using mixed research methods. The study found that news on Iraq War dissent was largely vocalized by the general public, mainly anti-war protestors and active military/war veterans. These war critics presented new counterframes to the original war story, which earlier research showed had been framed by the Bush administration. Counterframes characterized the war as illegal, immoral, and based on lies. These public-driven messages also replaced the elite sourcing (of earlier coverage) with the views of non-elites, i.e., ordinary citizens. Such counterframes emerged primarily through journalist-selected news quotes about the Iraq War that amplified themes of White House accountability."

While many studies have focused on how major Western media covered foreign issues using news framing as a theory of powerful mass media, there is little known of how communist media have covered the foreign issues and how differently they may interpret the same events. This study examines the overall framing patterns in North Korean news coverage toward self and others. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to explore whether dominant ideology have been used in their news editorials as a means to channel each political ideology into the public and the society. The study concluded that the leaders ideology would lead to a coverage, which is heavily propagandistic, would help to uphold a strong positive image of its government and support the role of government itself to the international negotiation."
2008-0909,"News Framing and the ""War on Terror"": Securitization as a Media Effect",raq War,,,,Paper,"News Framing and the ""War on Terror"": Securitization as a Media Effect",Iraq War,"Securitization, a theoretical approach growing out of security studies, is a process by which security-related issues are cast as immediate, ?existential? threats to national or cultural survival, requiring extraordinary measures, rather than matters to be dealt with by the regular workings of political or legal systems. A political figure who successfully ?securitizes? an issue like immigration or political violence, in theory, gains authority over how those extraordinary measures are set out and put into practice. This study proposes securitization as a form of framing and tests its potential significance by presenting experimental participants with a series of news articles presented in securitized or unsecuritized form. Among those who are already oriented toward government, securitized articles appear to increase an already strong tendency to perceive a serious threat and to trust government to handle that threat. Among those opposed to government, securitized articles appear to be processed less thoroughly. The results have implications for how journalists handle quickly developing coverage of security issues and how they approach political actors? efforts to present those issues as extraordinary threats or as matters best dealt with by the workings of established institutions."

In it, 586 news articles were examined to detect the type of news frames in the immigration news coverage. Two framing devices -the Index of importance and the Index of evaluation, apart from two frame packages, the Issue frame and Visual frame were created to interpret and map the interactions of these frames found in the news content. Analysis outcomes made it possible to observe how the information in terms of immigration and immigrants has been treated in these regional news media."

The study introduced the construct perceived channel efficiency in information access process and found perceived channel efficiency of the Internet media and traditional media vary due to media functions and scope of information provided. The study looked at media dependency in the context of the Internet media and tested to what degree perceived channel efficiency of different media and diversity of news information seeking contribute to media dependency. Contrary to the media dependency thesis, availability of functional alternative was found to predict dependency on preferred media positively instead of negatively. Possible reasons were explored, including time needed to get adapted to the digital age, changing scenario of functional alternatives, and ritual use of media and inertia."

The study focuses on indicators of a European Public Sphere in the CFSP coverage. Specifically we examined the visibility of CFSP news, the degree of Europeanization of coverage, explicit evaluations of CFSP in the news and the presence of risk and opportunity frames. Our results reveal considerable variation both between countries and broadsheets in the amount of attention to CFSP issues. We identified that, overall, CFSP was more visible in the news during prescheduled key events. Coverage was primarily Europeanized in character, both at the level of featuring actors and geographical placement. When evaluative, CFSP news had a distinctive positive dimension, especially with reference to the EU as an entity. Coverage in most countries was significantly more frequently framed in terms of opportunity rather than risk. These findings suggest that the news coverage of CFSP is rather exceptional, compared to the coverage of EU in general. Implications for the formation of public opinion and the legitimacy of CFSP are discussed."

The changing patterns of audience involvement in media production process coincide with widespread media commercialization in China. Our model focuses on media perception and efficacy, examining them at personal and societal levels and connecting them to a host of media use variables. A total of 2,409 valid interviews from face-to-face surveys were collected in four cities during November 2006 and May 2007. Results show that, at a macro level, media commercialization and liberalization play a vital role in shaping audiences perception of media and the likelihood of media participation. At the micro level, the use of different types of news media was found to have multiple consequences. In addition, significant regional differences were identified. Implications for understanding the media and the social and political situations in China were discussed on the basis of the findings."
2008-0914,Newspaper Form and Multivocal Content: A Comparison of the French and U.S. Journalistic Fields,dentity/Diversity,,,,Paper,Newspaper Form and Multivocal Content: A Comparison of the French and U.S. Journalistic Fields,Identity/Diversity,"Democratic normative theory suggests that the press should promote a broad range of viewpoints, yet little research has attempted to identify and explain variations in press multivocality. Given their political, economic, and journalistic professional differences, the French and U.S. press are predicted to differ significantly in their level of multivocality. In a case study of immigration news, the French press as a whole offers greater ideological (frame) and speaker diversity. Individual French newspapers, despite their partisan leanings, also are more internally pluralist than U.S. newspapers. Journalistic news form is shown to shape the level of multivocality. In contrast to the U.S. emphasis on individual narratives, the French story ensemble format (grouping together breaking news articles, editorials and other commentaries, interview transcripts, and background features) serves as the opening to a wide-ranging public conversation."

Given the goal of media policy to promote the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, the questions are framed as follows:

Market Level

RQ1: Does the existence of a newspaper-TV combination result in more news being produced in a market?
RQ2: Does the existence of a newspaper-TV combination result in a larger number of news outlets in a market?

Station level

RQ3: Do cross owned outlets slant the news?
RQ4: Does the editorial position of the news outlet affect (correlate with) its reporting of the news?

The existence of a small set of newspaper-TV combinations that were grandfathered when the rule was adopted and more recent waiving of the rule provides the opportunity to answer these questions with econometric methods.

The results uniformly support the restriction on cross ownership: markets with newspaper-TV combinations do not have more news or a larger number of stations producing news. Cross owned TV stations slant the news and the slant is in the same direction as the editorial endorsements of the cross-owned newspapers.
We also find a sharp distinction between grandfathered combinations, which produce less news and are more likely to exhibit slant, and the waived combinations. Therefore, the long-term impact of newspaper-TV combinations is likely to be particularly detrimental to the public policy goal."

A Comparative Analysis of Women's Roles in Network News,Feminist Voices in Media Analysis,"Women are increasingly being appointed to more prominent on camera roles in network news, including CBS's hire of former morning news anchor Katie Couric to anchor the ""CBS Evening News."" But does this new prominence result in more on-air time for women overall? And how has network story coverage and placement shifted as a result of these personnel chages. This study compares data collected in 1986 and 2007 to analyze if the roles of women in network news across all shows and time slots changed between these years. This comparative content analysis of network news programming looks at issues of story type, story placement, reporter gender, and reporter race. The study expands from other studies in that includes early morning news shows, morning news programs, news magazine shows, and overnight news. We believe this is the first time that a comprehensive comparison of all news programming aired on the three broadcast networks has been undertaken."

Integrating Competing Concepts to Explain News Processing,,,,Paper,News value and narrativity in professional journalism and user-generated news on the www,News Between Narrativity and News Value. Integrating Competing Concepts to Explain News Processing,"Critics of new reporting in news papers, radio or television have emphasized that journalistic selection and construction routines lead to news with only little appeal for the audience. Although the news point out the most relevant aspects of events (like elites-references, potential danger or negative consequences), they fail to capture the audiences sustained interest. News items complying with news factors are obviously not sufficiently attractive for the audience to pay attention, processes the information thoroughly, and remember them.

With the advent of larger virtual memory in the www and improving possibilities for users to generate content themselves new forms of news reporting have emerged. Lay-journalists not adhering to professional routines have started to contribute their own account of news and have shown considerable success in the audience. Some observers hold that rather than simply stringing together news factors they construct news according to narrativity factors: They write good stories. A high degree of narrativity is often believed to present a competitive advantage over the exclusively news value oriented reporting by professional journalists.

This paper aims at assessing the relationship between narrativity and news value in professional journalism in the conventional media and lay journalism in the user-generated web content. It presents findings from a comparative content analysis of political and non-political news reports in newspapers and content claiming to cover current events in the web 2.0. The findings indicate that news content beyond professional journalism possesses higher degrees of narrativity while news factors play a critical role in both professional and lay journalism."

Vlogs are of particular interest because they are visual texts that are user-generated. Vloggers engage with videos on several levels  they are both the encoders and the decoders, both the producers and audience of videos. In particular, we examine gender differences in creating vlogs, viewing vlogs and using YouTube. Our study interprets the dominant messages conveyed by the visual elements of vlogs. Analyzing online videos presents a new challenge for researchers: traditionally, analysis of visual media and communication focused on either the production or the reception of the material. Our vlog study uses a dual analytical approach to analyze both production and reception, while conducting content visual and audience analysis, thus making a useful contribution to the field of new visual media and communication."
2008-0919,New Zealand and Chinese Managers' Reflections on Marketing Strategies Used in Sales Promotion Letters,Public Relations Scholar to Scholar Interactive Poster Session,,,,Paper,New Zealand and Chinese Managers' Reflections on Marketing Strategies Used in Sales Promotion Letters,Public Relations Scholar to Scholar Interactive Poster Session,"Culture, persuasion and advertising strategies are closely intertwined in intercultural business communication. This paper reports cross-cultural findings on different advertising strategies used in sales promotions letters in New Zealand and China. A theoretical model is developed based on genre, and qing (feelings) and li (reason) for soliciting managers views. Specifically New Zealand and Chinese managers views on effective advertising in sales letters of their own culture as well as on their counterparts were compared. It has been found that persuasive orientations underpin the criteria for effective advertising strategies in each of the target cultures. Pathos or qing and logos or li should be seen as a continuum which can be adjusted appropriately when communicating with their counterparts. The focus on persuasive orientations has implications for managers communicating with different cultures which can serve as an important parameter for them to adjust their expectations when doing international marketing in cultures different from their own. This study extends adverting research to sales promotion letters and use new dimensions of genre study, qing and li, and cultural reflections, which stays away from Hofstedes cultural dimensions and which also offers in-depth analysis about the impact of culture on advertising."

The purpose of this research is to test three of the propositions of the Symbiotic Sustainability Model (SSM), a recent theory which describes several dimensions of NGO-corporate alliances. From a sample of 155 Fortune 500 corporations and 695 NGOs drawn from corporations websites, this research examines a) the number of NGOs with which corporations are likely to report alliances, b) the relationship between corporate stakeholders and the selection of particular NGO alliance partners, and c) the patterns of alliances that exist between corporations in economic industries and NGOs in social issue industries. This research provides support for the SSM. In particular, this research demonstrates that most corporations only form a few alliances with NGOs and with one NGO in an issue industry. In addition, the results suggest that corporations with similar stakeholders are likely to form alliances with different NGOs in the same issue industries. Finally, this research reports preliminary findings about alliances between corporations in 11 economic industries and NGOs in 59 social issue industries. Implications for corporate social responsibility and the study of cross-sector communication relationships are drawn."

The neo-liberal economy has replaced the notion of jobs for life with arrays of jobs that constantly shift and change and this has placed individuals in a position to constantly train and learn new materials that their new jobs might require. The perpetual anxiety of having to constantly learn due to the unstable and unpredictable job market has become the basis of permanent or lifelong education. As a means of engaging individuals in permanent learning, the convergence of education and entertainment or edutainment became inevitable. RTV shows, especially the instructional shows such as Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and The Supernanny have thrived at the calling of edutainment. By analyzing these different instructional RTV shows, I try to examine how instructional RTV shows are used as the neo-liberal educational tool and what kind of messages are being taught to the neo-liberal students-both the participants and the viewers of the shows."

This paper uses Straubhaars multilevel approach and analytical structure for understanding global systems, as a framework for discussing the international flow of Nigerian video films. In examining the Nigerian video film industry, this paper analyzes its geocultural markets, examines structural and cultural influences on content and how thematic elements discussed within the framework of modernization and hybridization account for its international appeal."

Like other systematic forms of privileging such as white, male, class and heteronormative privilege, monogamous forms of sexuality are valued in the social not simply intrinsically, due to the qualities of that relationship form, but alsoproblematicallydue to a corresponding disavowal of non-monogamous forms of relationship, and the absence of an acknowledgement of their even possible validity. As such, intimacy is organized in a societal dyad that is based on a logic of privilege: that is, a systematic relationship where one form of life has symbolic, socio-cultural, and/or socio-economic power at the specific expense of another (or multiple other) forms of life. Such a relationship is made manifest in the intimate public sphere, where non/monogamy maps onto a discursive system that allots prominence and power along privileged lines. Through discourse analysis, and drawing on queer theory, feminist and antiracist writing, this paper will explore the dynamics of intimate privilege and how such privilege does not simply map onto heteronormative monogamy, but rather how the intersectionality of privilege/oppression enable some non-monogamous forms (due to intersecting privileges, such as Western-ness, and socio-economic status of practitioners) to have greater access to that privileged space of recognition and power, while others (due to intersecting oppressions, such as sexism and structural racism) are often still excluded from that space."

As on-screen images tell powerful stories about culture and ethnicity to wide audiences, it is important to understand not only what is being told, but how the stories relate to a larger social discourse. A close study of the supporting character Nazo in Big Daddy reveals the image of a non-native speaker of English as a comedic element based on commonly used stereotypes. This study also uncovers a social climate in which representations of non-native speakers as incompetent and subordinate to others are accepted, normalized, and unexamined. The discussion calls attention to the social impact of such mediated images on public support for language policies as well as on the professional identity of non-native speakers of English."
2008-0925,Nonprofessional Activity on Television in a Time of Digitalisation,The Changing Spaces of Popular Media Production: Transformations and Trajectories,,,,Paper,Nonprofessional Activity on Television in a Time of Digitalisation,The Changing Spaces of Popular Media Production: Transformations and Trajectories,"The article presents an empirically based examination of how the Norwegian television industry includes audience activity and audience-generated material, and of how audiences respond to the opportunities presented. It explores three main research questions: First, how extensive is audience activity on television? Second, to what degree do different television activities correspond to familiar patterns of social stratification? And third, is there any evidence for the view that digital feedback channels, such as SMS and Web, provide access to television for new groups of people? To investigate these questions, a case study of the Norwegian media market has been carried out, based on two data sets. The extent of audience activity is examined through a representative audience survey carried out during two weeks in 2004. The second data set is a one-week survey of Norwegian television output on the six Norwegian-language channels in 2005."
2008-0926,"No Pain, No Gain: Investigating College Athletes Sick Role Expectations",Research on Healthcare and Sick Roles,,,,Paper,"No Pain, No Gain: Investigating College Athletes Sick Role Expectations",Research on Healthcare and Sick Roles,"Parsons (1951; 1975) notion of a sick role was founded on an assumption that one can distinguish between the state of illness and the role of patients in interactions with therapeutic agents. This study indicates that expectations of duties and rights associated with a sick role may not be enough to explain college athletes engagement in medical encounters. Overall, the duty to seek care accounted for college athletes reports of more open engagement in medical services. On the other hand, expectation of guilt in medical encounters predicted athletes reports of less directness and more concealment in medical encounters, as predicted. This study shows that a different social regulator  emotions such as anticipated guilt - may play an important role in understanding health visits as well as ones directness about and concealment of health issues."
2008-0927,No Silence - No Spiral? Public Expression of Opinion Tested in a Realistic Setting,Public Discourse,,,,Paper,No Silence - No Spiral? Public Expression of Opinion Tested in a Realistic Setting,Public Discourse,"The aim of this paper is to contribute to the methodological discourse of the Spiral of Silence Theory by summarizing the current research status quo and by discussing one possible alternative for the operationalization of the ?core? of the theory, namely the willingness to express one?s opinion. Up until now the majority of researchers tend to use scenario measures rather than actual opinion expressions to operationalize the public expression of opinion. But several researchers come to the conclusion that the actual scenario measure technique is insufficient to put the participants into the specific psychological condition originally demanded by the theory. Our study tries to meet these concerns by measuring the expression of opinion in a realistic situation. Therefore we conducted a one-factor experiment followed by a qualitative post-survey in which 60 students participated. The results show that testing the public expression of opinion in a realistic setting is a promising approach. Our study achieves important methodological and theoretical conclusions that should be considered in further research."

Although these two affective states represent the same negative valence, due to their distinctive cognitive origins, they may not lead viewers to choose homogeneous media content as Zillmann's mood-management theory predicts. Considering distinctions among negative states, the present study conducted an experiment (N = 109) manipulating sad, angry, and neutral feelings using hypothetical scenarios and repeatedly measuring preference for four media genressad dramas, actions, comedies, and game shows. Results showed that although both sad and angry participants wanted to watch comedies over the other three genres, they formed divergent preference patterns within each genre. Results were further discussed in terms of the role of gender stereotypical beliefs about anger and sadness that enhance gender-appropriate media choice.

Improved CD players, even a theoretically perfect one, can sound no better than the compromises made in the design of CD encoding. By contrast, analog recording and playback are based in mechanical processes rather than measurement and coding designs, so the practical compromises of a given medium do not establish hard limits on fidelity in principle. This leaves something to be discovered and the dream of perfection still alive. Improved turntables, for example, have increased the appreciation of the information available in the microgrooves of the stereo LP, demonstrating that the real limits of fidelity were not yet known and providing motivation to continue trying. With an analog medium we can imagine the true, dream of perfection, and strive for the better. With a digital medium all of those questions are already answered by arbitrary dictate: This good and no better. Since the CD the most successful home audio media, especially lossy compression schemes such as MP3, have mostly replaced the ideals of fidelity and truth with instrumental logic and criteria such as cost, speed, and portability. The danger is that we are constructing a musical culture that is ever more efficiently less beautiful and less good.

Therefore, I will review diverse postures regarding the nature and function of the image as a basis to introduce and stress the idea of absence or distance inside the image, an idea that, even if marginally present in different moments of the theorization about images and the imaginary (and recently rediscovered in some post-structuralists theories), has been nevertheless repeatedly ignored by mainstream theorization about visual practices as a possible pivotal point in the understanding of our relationship with images."

University students in France and the US. engaged in interaction with each other for five weeks via instant messaging or online forums (in these forums students posted questions and answers to members of the other culture). Since the French students were learning English, all students communicated in English. Before and after the interaction period, participants completed two attitude measures: 1) twelve Semantic Differential adjective pairs {Osgood, 1957}) and 2) a modified version of Neuliep and McCroskeys (1997) revised Generalized Ethnocentrism Scale (GENE).
Results showed a significant, positive change in attitudes towards members of the other culture after interaction, and significant differences between the French and Americans in the modified GENE measure, which was modified to be specific to the other culture. Findings, limitations, and implications of the study will be discussed."
2008-0932,Nuances About the Role and Impact of Affect in Inoculation,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media II,,,,Paper,Nuances About the Role and Impact of Affect in Inoculation,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media II,"This investigation is the most ambitious effort to date to understand the role and impact of affect in resistance. A three-phase experiment was conducted involving 281 participants. The results indicated that inoculation treatments initially elicited threat and issue involvement; later, they enhanced attitude certainty and attitude strength and, ultimately, they conferred resistance to counterattitudinal attacks. In addition, inoculation exerted more nuanced outcomes. Inoculation enhanced the number and strength of cognitive responses to counterarguments, but it exerted less impact on affective responses to counterarguments. Immediately following the administration of inoculation treatments, inoculation reduced elicited fear; but, after exposure to counterattitudinal attacks, inoculation enhanced elicited anger but reduced elicited happiness. The investigation also compared effectiveness of cognitive, affective-positive, and affective-negative treatments. Unlike past studies, the conceptualization/operationalization of affective inoculation messages featured refutation of counterarguments using arguments supported by hard evidence (the same substantive content as the cognitive messages), differing only from cognitive messages in that the affective messages also employed triggers, signaling either that a persons goals may be facilitated (affective-positive treatments) or thwarted (affective-negative messages). The results revealed that affective-negative messages were superior to the affective-positive treatments, and even the cognitive messages, in eliciting threat, issue involvement, and cognitive counterarguing output and in enhancing the cognitive content of associative networks."

Sexual content appears in less than five percent of the advertisements. Violence appears in about two percent of the ads. The objectionable content does not always conform to traditional sex role stereotypes, but most of it is mild. Explicit expressions, socially discouraged practices, physical humiliation and complete nudity are extremely rare. In comparison with American ads, Israeli advertisements tend to present a higher share of sexual content and a lower share of violent content  but these cultural differences are minor in extent. The results are discussed from inter-cultural and intra-cultural perspectives, taking into account regulation factors and political implications."

According to Reeves and Nass (1996), people tend to respond socially and naturally to computers as well. We apply these streams of research in the context of digital gaming. Concretely, we aim to unravel behavioral indicators of game experience by means of observational coding of behavior exhibited during game play. In one experiment we manipulated the difficulty level of a first person shooter game and coded behavioral indicators of boredom, arousal, valence and frustration. In a second experiment we let people play a racing game in different social settings (e.g., alone, competitive) and observed their behavior in quest of indicators of interpersonal involvement, immediacy, and rapport. In both experiments we validate our observational findings against self-report and psychophysiological measures."

A theory of power, Dunbars (2004) dyadic power theory (DPT), was tested experimentally by manipulating power in interactions with confederate strangers. Participants verbal and nonverbal dominance behaviors were coded from videotapes of their interactions. DPT proposes that individuals will display more dominance in equal power relationships than in unequal relationships and increasing an individuals relative power will increase that individuals satisfaction with the encounter. The results revealed that the equal-power and unequal high-power conditions displayed more similar levels of dominance than those in the unequal low-power and unequal high-power conditions and that those in the equal power condition were the most satisfied with their interaction. Implications for DPT and the relationship between micro-level dominance behaviors and the macro-level impressions of dominant interactants are discussed."
2008-0936,'Occasional' Drinking: Some Uses of a Nonstandard Temporal Metric,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,,,,Paper,'Occasional' Drinking: Some Uses of a Nonstandard Temporal Metric,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,"Doctors regularly work to generate rates of patients alcohol use. One way patients resist this work is by using nonstandard temporal metrics (such as occasionally) to describe their alcohol usage. In this paper we demonstrate that and how patients and physicians treat this metric as specifically used in place of a rate of use. Thus it can be seen as a method whereby one can obviate a rate of use, thereby avoiding providing an abstract quantification of ones drinking practices.
Fundamental to the methods for resisting quantification is the effort to invoke or appeal to the situated, lived context of ones practice. That is, most methods of resistance involve an assertion that a de-contextualized count is not an adequate or appropriate representation of ones habit. Thus these efforts of resistance are perspicuous displays of what has been termed the morality of cognition. They are also demonstrations of the subtle contentiousness inherent in any institutional interaction, wherein institutional agents work to obtain abstractly rendered quantitative information from their public.
The data for this paper are drawn from over 100 audio and video recordings of primary care interactions between doctors and patients, transcribed according to the Gail Jefferson transcription conventions, and are analyzed using conversation analytic methods."

Through their routine coverage of scientific developments, news media are a critical intermediary in translating research for the public, patients, practitioners and policymakers. Until now, little was known about how U.S. health and medical science reporters and editors initiate, prioritize and develop news stories related to health and medicine. We surveyed 468 reporters and editors representing 463 local and national broadcast and print media outlets to characterize individual and occupational practices leading to the development of health and medical science news. Our survey revealed that 70% of respondents had bachelors degrees; 8% were life sciences majors in college. Minorities are underrepresented in health journalism; 97% of respondents were non-Hispanic and 93% were White. Overall, initial ideas for stories come from a news source followed by press conferences or press releases. Regarding newsworthiness criteria, the potential for public impact and new information or development were the major criteria cited, followed by ability to provide a human angle and ability to provide a local angle. Significant differences were seen between responses from reporters vs. editors and print vs. broadcast outlets."

In this essay, we draw on broader psychological theories of the attitude-behavior relationship to postulate reciprocal patterns of causality between civic attitudes and various forms of political and civic engagement featured in contemporary research in political communication. We then examine the extent of these reciprocal relationships with a two-wave panel survey of 2,872 Pacific Northwest residents. Spanning the 2004 elections, the panel data support the reciprocal model by revealing bi-directional political attitude-behavior relationships, which we discuss further in our conclusion."

The textual analysis examines 280 online articles about the case from November 13, 2005, when the M&G reported that rape allegations against the former deputy president had been leaked to the press, through his acquittal in May 2006. The study suggests coverage represents the story primarily as a political scandal with frequent discussion of Zumas damaged political prospects, the fervent support he enjoyed among those sharing his Zulu ethnic heritage, and his tepid relationship with South African President Thabo Mbeki. The news values of drama, conflict, and prominence are embedded in the major themes, and they give rise to dichotomies pitting Zuma and his supporters against a variety of foes including his political enemies, his accuser, anti-rape activists, HIV/AIDS prevention educators, and selected South African media."

From censorship to the hazardous labor conditions on film sets, these marginal social forces are alternately avoided, appeased, and evoked by film workers. By examining media production as a capitalist labor process, I argue that contemporary capitalism entails both the cosmological and criminal underworlds. I use the concept of assemblage to illustrate the heterogeneity of practices that comprise capitalist cultural production."

Kennedy delivered a landmark speech urging Americans to re-examine their country's relations with the Soviet Union and participation in the Cold War. The initiative sparked a welcome detente that lasted until Kennedy's assassination, but not before improved bilateral ties produced an important test-ban treaty and a number of other conciliatory (though largely symbolic) exchanges. Outside of Etzioni's 1967 inquiry into the ""Kennedy Experiment,"" few if any scholars have examined the implications of this event in regards to public diplomacy. With an increasing number of public diplomacy scholars and practitioners championing a two-way paradigm, it follows that public diplomacy implemented in this way can supply the means for tension reduction and trust building. How did the ""Kennedy Experiment"" succeed in achieving these aims? What might these insights hold for the conduct of contemporary public diplomacy in light of changes in the communications environment?"

Older adolescents are frequent users of such social networking sites and therefore one goal of this study was to investigate their motives for use of them. The findings revealed that for the 703 older adolescents in this survey there were four motivations for use of social networking sites: passing time, entertainment, social identity gratifications and virtual companionship. Among participants who identified with their peer groups and reported positive feelings about them, the most important motivations for use were ritual in nature -- entertainment and passing time. By contrast, those participants who did not identify strongly with their peer groups and felt negative about them appeared to act instrumentally by seeking virtual companionship from social networking sites."

It presents findings from ethnographic interviews with youths and their parents in middle class families in Seoul. The lives of these youths are dominated by school and cram classes, in line with parental expectations and societal valorisation of academic excellence. Youths seek respite from such pressures through various media channels. While youths play online games and surf the Internet for fun, they also explore their identities through dressing up their avatars on their CyWorld homepages. They maintain Cheong (friendship ties) with their extensive social networks through chatting on Buddy Buddy messenger and mobile phone SMS. The paper finds that Korean youths use new media to carve out some personal space in lives which are otherwise compartmentalised and regimented. However, they also find the need to exercise self-restraint in their media use burdensome.

2008-0945,One Step Back From Democracy: Adoption of Online Identification System in Korea,Media Climate and Government Restrictions,,,,Paper,One Step Back From Democracy: Adoption of Online Identification System in Korea,Media Climate and Government Restrictions,"This paper examines the issue of Internet anonymity in South Korea. While the right to anonymity has been perceived as one of principles that policymakers should ensure because of the unique nature of the Internet as an open and decentralized communications infrastructure (Open Society Institute, 1997), others see risk in anonymity due to Internet users behavioral unaccountability and attempt to restrict the right to anonymity. This study will provide the background of the issue of limited anonymous Internet communication and how the Korean government has used the legal system to limit anonymity. After the background on anonymity, this article will address problems with the proposed bill in terms of free speech and privacy. Based on this discussion, this paper argues that anonymous communication should be preserved for protecting freedom of expression and suggests other policy options to minimize the most negative effects of anonymity."

Six national dailies from the three countries (i.e. the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Peoples Daily, China Daily, The Times of India and the Hindu) were randomly sampled and a total of 178,746 words were content analyzed. The study found that three presses were all ethnocentric in covering the war for their respective readers. US presses focused on war efforts and deemphasized antiwar topic; highlighted US sources and marginalized middle-east sources; selected neutral as the dominant attitude and marched US readers side by side with the US government to the war. Chinas presses emphasized the topic of war efforts but from the perspective of diplomatic effort for ending the war, which differed from US presses. China presented a wider spectrum of sources but still comparatively featured Chinese sources more than others. Antiwar attitude was more obvious in Chinas presses than in US presses and economic effect was more of its concern, which echoed Chinas government stand in the war. Indias presses took a more critical attitude toward the war than the Indian government. With the topic of antiwar as the dominant topic, Indian sources as the dominant source, antiwar attitude more obvious than US, India more concerned of the political effect of the war, Indian presses presented a different picture and voiced a different perspective. The implications of the relationship between media and government were discussed in the study."
2008-0947,On Feminist Theory of Public Relations: An Example From Dorothy E. Smith,Theoretical Developments in Public Relations,,,,Paper,On Feminist Theory of Public Relations: An Example From Dorothy E. Smith,Theoretical Developments in Public Relations,"In order to develop a feminist theory of public relations, we believe it is important to proceed according to one of the basic tenants of feminist theorizing, rejecting the replication of an approach that canonizes individual great men  or alternatively great women  theorists, and proposing the encouragement of an approach that affirms the growth of theory from the collective yet diverse experiences of women (and men). Consequently, in this essay we are not primarily focusing on the contribution of one individual feminist theorist to public relations, but rather we are using the particular way of theorizing of a feminist scholar, situated at the intersection of many fluctuating trends, to suggest the contours of a feminist theory of public relations. Various feminist theoretical positions work from analyses of societies that account for gender systems, womens identities, power relations, social injustice and social change. We employ the work of Canadian sociologist Dorothy E. Smith as an inspiration for those who advocate for incorporating womens critiques of society into public relations scholarship."

The study uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics  Child Development Supplement (PSID  CDS) which provides data of a representative sample of adolescents ages 12 to 18. According to the findings, unlike what the time displacement hypothesis predicts, time spent on online communication was not related to time spent interacting with friends. The findings from the structural equation model examining the relationships among initial sociability, online communication, and cohesive friendships supported the rich get richer hypothesis rather than the social compensation hypothesis.In addition, online communication was indirectly related to connectedness to school through cohesive friendships."
2008-0949,Online Communication and Gender: A Case Study of an Online Discussion Board for Korean Daughters-in-law,Race and Gender Effects in Technology Use,,,,Paper,Online Communication and Gender: A Case Study of an Online Discussion Board for Korean Daughters-in-law,Race and Gender Effects in Technology Use,"This study, using textual analysis method, examined a discussion board created for Korean women, focusing on (1) how gender and gender norms are discussed online, (2) what points of arguments were most agreed upon by online community members, and (3) whether the most agreed-upon norms reflect or challenge the traditional norms existing in the offline society. Postings in the discussion board disclose that patriarchal gender relations still exist in Korea. However, they also reveal ongoing changes in the society and womens active involvement in social change. The discussion board appears to contribute to goals of greater equality in a meaningful way. While new technologies themselves do not guarantee new social orders, the Internet seems to offer a possibility that traditional media never did, by allowing women to create media, generate media content, and promote new social orders via media."

The social and communicative aspects of net based games have the potential to durably tie the user to the gaming world. However, this does not mean that the online gaming experience detaches the gamers from their real life experience: In both a representative survey on online gamers (N = 688) and a series of guided interviews on gaming in everyday life, we found that gamers find ways of integrating the gaming experience into their real life structures. In our presentation, we will describe typical inclusion patterns, based on the quantitative and qualitative data. The data supports the notion that for most users, online gaming is an important, yet both enjoyable and manageable spare time activity. Still, for a minority of extreme users, online gaming has a negative impact, as the gaming experience starts to dominate their (real) life."
2008-0951,Online Infotainment: Exploring Incidental Exposure to Political Information on the Internet,Online Participation,,,,Paper,Online Infotainment: Exploring Incidental Exposure to Political Information on the Internet,Online Participation,"Scholars contend that the scope of journalism has changed in recent years, as the media have shifted toward more entertainment-based news, or infotainment. At the same time, the internet has become a popular medium for acquiring news and entertainment. This paper examines the intersection of soft news and internet research, exploring the impact of online infotainment during a U.S. midterm election. Using 2006 survey data from the Pew Internet & American Life Project, this study provides evidence that online infotainment may be a unique form of soft news, with implications for the way people gain political information from the internet during elections. The study finds that online infotainment leads to greater incidental exposure to political information on the internet. Using path analysis, this paper finds support for the idea that incidental exposure to political information on the internet is a mediating variable in the effect of online infotainment on promoting subsequent political information seeking online. Moreover, the paper shows that, contrary to findings from the larger body of soft news research, exposure to online infotainment is associated with higher levels of political interest, political activity, and traditional news media use. The results are consistent with Davis and Owens (1998) finding that new media are more likely to supplement, rather than supplant, mainstream media use. This study raises new questions about the implications of political infotainment on the internet, and concludes with suggestions for future research in this area."

In China, which has traditionally controlled information in all media, BBS systems permit readers to post responses directly after reading news items online. The purpose of this study was to examine one popular BBS in China to see the number of responses to news items, and the extent to which items that generated responses contained high levels of traditional news values. A composite week of top stories was examined across a number of topics. Results showed that more than 30,000 reader responses per day are being posted just to the top 100 news items on this single site. This number far exceeds more traditional methods of interaction such as letters to the editor. News items with higher levels of newsworthiness (deviance and social significance) received more responses from readers than those with lower levels of newsworthiness."

In the past, the Singapore government has cracked down on gay and lesbian organizations, and the explanation given is that the general Singapore public, made up of religious and conservative heartlanders, is intolerant of gay and lesbian lifestyles, thereby leading to the tough ant-homosexual laws. In the 1990s, with the proliferation of the Internet, a large scale migration of the local gay and lesbian community online occurred. The current study utilizes in-depth interviews (n=20) to find out the reasons for online organization, the strategies of these websites to increase social awareness, engage in political lobbying and the costs and benefits associated, as well as government monitoring and self-censorship. Implications of the gay and lesbian community in Singapores increasingly globalized economy are examined."
2008-0954,Online Social Support for Cancer and the Impact of Cancer Survival Rate and Community Host,Traditional and Online Sources of Social Support,,,,Paper,Online Social Support for Cancer and the Impact of Cancer Survival Rate and Community Host,Traditional and Online Sources of Social Support,"Online support communities are an important tool when seeking social support related to illnesses, particularly cancer. This investigation sought to understand how cancer survival rate and community host affected social support provisions within online support communities for cancers with high and low five-year relative survival rates. A quantitative content analysis was conducted on 3,717 messages from eight online support communities focused on cancers with high and low five-year relative survival rates. The communities were distributed between Yahoo!Groups (general-purpose web portal) and the Association for Cancer Online Resources (ACOR) (cancer-specific community host).

Although data indicates significant relationships between five-year relative survival rate and support types, the relationships were not as hypothesized. Greater proportions of emotional support were found in high-five year survival rate communities as opposed to low, whereas greater proportions of informational support were found in low-five year survival rate communities as opposed to high. A significant relationship between community host and social support type was also found with a greater proportion of informational support in ACOR communities than in Yahoo! and a greater proportion of emotional support in Yahoo! than in ACOR. It was concluded that differing proportions of social support types exist in cancer support communities according to the five-year relative survival rate of the cancer, as well as the community host. Healthcare providers referring patients to online cancer support groups may wish to determine an individuals support needs before making their recommendations in an effort to best match an online community with the type of support needed."

Theoretically the paper links the debates around the emergence of a journalistic field (Bourdieu) and the claim about re-feodalization of the political public sphere (Habermas). The emergence of the journalistic field is seen as something that characterizes the development of journalism after the initial re-feodalization critique was formulated. Empirically, this development is studied with content analysis of political news from the leading daily newspaper in Finland. The data and results are compared to Hallin & Benson?s (2007) similar study of France and US, thus enabling the paper to consider particularities of the Nordic (democratic-corporatist) case."
2008-0956,On The Emerging Basis of Therapeutic Expertise: Collaborative Therapists as Conversation Governors,Practical Uses of Language and Social Interaction Scholarship,,,,Paper,On The Emerging Basis of Therapeutic Expertise: Collaborative Therapists as Conversation Governors,Practical Uses of Language and Social Interaction Scholarship,"Collaborative therapists have described their practices as not springing from expertise, at least not expertise regarding relationships. They refer to their work with clients as conversation, and they use grand language to describe how these conversations are therapeutic. I'd like to consider that if they aren't experts at relationships (certainly not the particular relationships being focused on in therapy), then one area they ought to be experts in is therapeutic conversation. If so, then they could conceivably profit from knowing how discourse and conversation analysts, not to mention prescriptive approches to conversational excellence, construe the work of governing conversations. To what extent are they picking up on the strong current of conversation scholarship that has formed since in the 1990's? What avenues of conversation research might they usefully experiment with? How could working with these experts in therapeutic conversation inform practical scholarship in conversation?"
2008-0957,On the Values Guiding the French Practice of Journalism: Interviews of Twelve War Correspondents,High Density Session: Talking to Journalists About Journalism,,,,Paper,On the Values Guiding the French Practice of Journalism: Interviews of Twelve War Correspondents,High Density Session: Talking to Journalists About Journalism,"What are the values guiding the French practices of journalism? What is the place of objectivity among these values? These questions were asked to twelve war correspondents working for seven of the main French daily and weekly newspapers.
While objectivity is almost unanimously rejected from the outset as an unattainable standard or an undesirable norm, it turns out that a definition of objectivity is lacking and that this notion is often mistaken for neutrality. Three different conceptions of objectivity-as-neutrality emerge from the interviewees discourses: objectivity/neutrality as a separation between facts and commentaries, as cautiousness in labelling and as balance between the parties.
Can or should one of these conceptions serve as a guideline in the daily practice of journalism? The interviewees seem to be divided on the question and several propose moral values or attitudes, such as honesty or modesty, as alternatives. But in turn the reference to moral values proves problematical and eventually most of the journalists quote accuracy and/or fairness as criteria for the evaluation of their work: être juste  meaning both to be accurate (justesse) and to be fair (justice) - is what is expected from a professional journalist."
2008-0958,"Ontology, Complexity and Defamiliarisation: What Media Anthropology Does That Other Media Studies Disciplines Dont","Culture, Media, and New Ethnography",,,,Paper,"Ontology, Complexity and Defamiliarisation: What Media Anthropology Does That Other Media Studies Disciplines Dont","Culture, Media, and New Ethnography","In this paper, I ask: what can media anthropology offer to media studies? What are its unique attributes as a mode of enquiry? First, I identify three approaches that are limited in their grasp of the potential of media anthropology. They assume either its excessive or insufficient autonomy and thus overlook media anthropologys specific methodological powers. The first approach is media anthropologys tendency to reinvent the wheel by ignoring basic tenets in media theory. An example comes from recent research on citizen journalism in India, which raises classic issues of editorial functions and of the epistemology of news, issues long addressed in the sociology of news and from which anthropological studies might learn. The second conceives of anthropologys contribution in terms of ritual aspects of communication, a Durkheimian perspective itself in question in social theory. The third reduces media ethnography to a focus on audiences, often equated with activism or resistance to hegemony and thereby risking empirical foreclosure and the reification of audience-ing.

I then consider two unique contributions of media anthropology, each central to its methodological stance. First, media anthropology brings a refreshing approach to complexity, conditioning and causality in the analysis of media processes. Overcoming perceived divisions among macro, meso and micro, between political-economic, institutional, culturalist and textual analyses, between structural and practice-oriented perspectives, anthropology attends to their interplay. To illustrate I draw on my ethnography of the BBC, in which it was imperative to connect these levels. Second, anthropology brings to media research an important corrective in addressing the ethics, aesthetics and politics of media practices. Blasting through ethnocentric and universalizing assumptions, anthropologists have highlighted how media practices in non-Western societies can only be understood by tracing the distinctive ontologies that govern them. This constitutes a crucial challenge to Euro-American media theory."

Based on focus groups conducted with students, we found that source authority is not a major determinant in students informational evaluations, in contrast to some previous research. This is a result of the difficulty of reliably determining source characteristics. To compensate for this lack of authority, students attempt to corroborate found information with additional sources and employ other heuristic strategies. Wikipedia poses an interesting epistemological challenge to users as it represents a relatively novel form of information creation  open editing by semi-anonymous visitors to the site. We find that student credibility assessments are highly pragmatic, and present a new model of assessment that accounts for the changing informational landscape of the web."
2008-0960,Open Source as Public Sphere,Public Relations and the Ontology of the Public Sphere,,,,Paper,Open Source as Public Sphere,Public Relations and the Ontology of the Public Sphere,"The idea of open source has outgrown its technical origins and become attached -- sometimes with more meaning, sometimes less -- to the language of political economy. It has done so in ways that seem to evoke the core structures and tensions of Jurgen Habermass public sphere. This paper argues that useful insight can be gleaned by a close reading of the public-sphere literature in light of open source, and attempts to sketch the outlines of such a reading. I identify two intersections, one concerned with the techniques of the public sphere and the other with its content: open-source software development seen as an instance of rational-critical debate, and the free-culture movement studied as a public-sphere project. I conclude that the latter offers a fruitful avenue of investigation for applying the public-sphere lens to open source, and perhaps for amplifying Habermass idea to accommodate todays communications environment."
2008-0961,Oprah.com: Lifestyle Expertise and the Politics of Recognition,Media and Social Change: Transforming Self and Communities,,,,Paper,Oprah.com: Lifestyle Expertise and the Politics of Recognition,Media and Social Change: Transforming Self and Communities,"The contemporary mediascape has been marked by a proliferation of popular TV genres in which the public appear as central protagonists. These genres are part of a broader shift in the relationship between media and audiences that challenge traditional conceptions of public service broadcasting and appear to represent a shift from media as public knowledge to media as constituting a space for diffuse popular engagement. A central feature of this shift has been the growing role of popular forms of expertise on television. This paper maps the main critical debates around participatory television and the role of the expert, from earlier work on talk shows to more recent discussions of reality and makeover TV. It notes a transition within the critical media and cultural studies literature from a focus on public sphere theory and questions of democratization to a growing concern with the role played by popular media culture in supporting new modes of governance based on the expert mediation of normative self-control. In this paper we analyse the role of experts on Oprah Winfreys popular website Oprah.com noting both the utility and limitations of a governmental perspective. Extending upon Foucaults notion of the productive nature of liberal subjecthood, the paper suggests the more positive role played by popular expertise in contributing to a media-civic culture articulated to a politics of recognition."
2008-0962,Oral Trials in the Mexican Legal System,cholar to Scholar Interactive Paper Session - Communication Law and Policy,,,,Paper,Oral Trials in the Mexican Legal System,Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper Session - Communication Law and Policy,"Mexico is moving quickly to implement a legal reform called juicios orales (oral trials) in order to establish greater public confidence in the Mexican criminal justice system. Based on earlier reforms in other Latin American countries like Chile and Argentina, the basic concept of oral trials is that the judges will now hear arguments delivered orally, rather than through the submission of written briefs. This innovation promises to lower trial costs and court delays, while offering more transparency into the judicial process. At the same time, the process will require wholesale changes to legal education in Mexico and accordingly, may change the very nature of the legal profession. Because some notion of communication as a public value is at the heart of the promise of oral trials as a legal reform, it is helpful to understand how proponents of oral trials believe that orality will lead to better public communication. In this paper, we outline the basic concept of oral trials as a communicative practice, look at the communicative value of transparency as an anti-corruption measure, and outline the communication values embedded within this reform movement."

The author documents possible reasons for the separation of the two research fields, presents a theoretical approach which perceives decisions as the characteristic form of organizational communication and discusses the unique paradox connected with this mode of communication as well as different strategies of de-paradoxification. The proposed contingency model allows for a discussion of public relations and organizational communication an o common theoretical basis, offers new insights into communication management as management of contingency, and leaves room for analysing the challenges of new communication media."

Forty-three practitioners with a mean of 14.5 years professional experience participated in a 2 X 2 (contingencies for dialogue X technological orientation of organization) experiment.

This study, therefore, examined the American workers organizational identification with a Japanese multinational corporation. One hundred and nineteen American workers participated in a survey, which measured workers levels of organizational identification and ethnocentrism as well as their perceptions regarding management practices, management communication, and dimensions of organizational cultures (i.e., people vs. work orientation, open vs. closed system, loose vs. tight control). The results indicated that workers level of organizational identification is associated with managements evaluation, workers control, and people orientation as an organizational culture."

Relying on SIDE theory this 2x2 experimental design tested the effects of adherence to organizational norms and interpersonal familiarity in email messages. In addition, both the superior and subordinate perspectives on these messages were examined. Results reveal that using norm congruent email messages account for over 50% of variance in both superior and subordinate attitudes toward the message, and between 30% and 56% of variance in perceptions of source credibility. Data from the superiors indicate that norm congruent email messages account for 14.4% of the variance in message compliance. Results from subordinates reveal an interaction effect that is consistent with SIDE-based predictions. Subordinates believe superiors are most likely to comply with email requests from unfamiliar subordinates that are crafted in a manner congruent with organizational norms. Implications of these findings are discussed."

Organizing on a platform of concerned mothers seeking to keep genetically engineered materials out of food and the environment, MAdGE used a range of tactics to draw the attention to their cause. Opponents frequently chastised the group for encouraging exaggerating fears about genetic engineering. Yet MAdGE can be considered as performing an important democratic public interest function in challenging the Government, science organisations, and corporations to be more open about their involvement in, and promotion of, genetic technologies. Of particular note was their organizing around the legislative process to call government regulatory decision-making to account. Ultimately, however, MAdGEs move from street protest into the rational judiciary left them vulnerable to legal and financial reprisal by the state. The paper theorizes the groups strategies in terms of the emotive carnivalesque where tactics of the fool and court jester were used to draw undermine pro-Genetic engineering discourses, as well as the inherent problems of combining the carnivalesque with rational bureaucratic tactics for activists who lack the power and financial resources needed to sustain long term critique of the state and its corporate allies."

Byerly, associate professor, Howard U

Ethnic studies, womens studies, and even gay and lesbian studies recognized the social construction of identity in the 1970s and 1980s, but critical traditions largely walked around the notion of how white identity is formed until the late 1980s. Sociologist Frankenbergs research helped to shape an emerging study of whiteness and to show its relationship to larger power structures. Whiteness has been accused of being an essentialist concept, even while scholars in diverse fields expanded its theoretical applications. But don't all social constructionist theories of identity make certain assumptions about characteristics and experiences of groups central to them? Other scholars have asked who is really ""white,"" a term that has multiple definitions, beginning with the official U.S. Census definition. Still, this presentation will argue, why can't the conceptualization of a dominant group associated with Euro-centric history, values, and aesthetics (among other things) be useful to communication scholars who are seeking to understand the complex interplay of power relations in society, including the media's role in shaping these? This presentation provides the framework for five additional presentations, to follow."

Our Truck. campaign for its popular line of Silverado trucks, a series of television ads layering images of idyllic, pastoral, and patriarchal America over John Mellencamps jingoistic ballad Our Country. This study is an examination of the campaign, one that looks at the impact of a commercial which sells a myopic vision of what America is (and should be). Through the use of qualitative surveys and interviews, as well as discourse analysis/tracking, this study analyzes the encoding and decoding processes of one of the campaigns commercials. The research suggests that the patriotic appeal to American values in the advertisement connects with political beliefs and that those left out of the commercial dont feel a part of Our Country. By tracking the discursive symbolism of the commercial onto Chevrolet trucks (bumper stickers), this study further suggests the impact of patriotism in advertising."

A content analysis of prime-time programming (63 hours) was used to detect overrepresented and underrepresented topics in four content domains: criminality, occupations, demography and sex life. A survey (N=517) tested the effect of different topics on reality estimation and found no systematic differences between topics that are overrepresented in the TV fare and topics that are underrepresented. The fact that distorted reality estimation may occur with topics that are not frequently depicted in the programming supports the thesis that cultivation stems from active learning of facts and figures from the screen."

There is a need to classify fans in the study of both parasocial interaction and also the study of fan communities, particularly in order to differentiate the fan suffering from pathologies compared to fans who are healthy and who lead normal and productive lives. This system of classification is based on 19 years of participant observation in various fan communities. Nine motivations (Table 1) and five (of eight) levels (Table 2) are described as the result of grounded theory analysis of documents written by fans wherein they answered the question Why are you a fan of your favorite celebrity?"

This investigation focused on the information-seeking behaviors of parents (N = 38) whose newborn has received a positive screening result for cystic fibrosis. Analysis of behavior prior to the clinic visit revealed that about half of the sample actively sought information about their childs (potential) disease. The most common sources of information were the internet, pediatricians, and family physicians. Analysis of interaction behavior during the clinic visit showed rates of question asking that we judged as low in an absolute sense, but which were comparable to the results of other studies. It was observed that occasionally parents would collaborate to generate a single question. Frequency of collaborative questions was positively correlated with education, with knowledge of cystic fibrosis six weeks after the clinic visit, and with apparent dissatisfaction with the various aspects of the counseling interaction. The results point toward the need for the medical establishment to become more proactive in providing information to parents of children who have received a positive screen for cystic fibrosis."

A panel of early (N = 883) and a panel of middle adolescents (N = 651) rated three times, in three consecutive years, how often their parents used instructive and restrictive mediation strategies, and how often they watched television together with their parents. The results showed that various forms of parental mediation are not at all uncommon in adolescence, even among teenagers in twelfth grade. Latent growth curve analyses, on the other hand, indicated that each of these parental mediation strategies tend to decline throughout adolescence, at varying paces. In addition, paired latent growth curve analyses pointed out that the decreasing occurrence of instructive mediation and co-viewing appears to be related to the process of adolescent separation; the declining incidence of restrictive mediation in adolescence was not related to the separation process."
2008-0976,Parents' Moral Reflections on Childrens Media Use,"LSI Studies on the Relation of Parents, Children, and Media",,,,Paper,Parents' Moral Reflections on Childrens Media Use,"LSI Studies on the Relation of Parents, Children, and Media","Parents have been greeting each new communication medium with a mixture of fear and hope for the last few decades. The present study proposes that media use is a highly morally loaded arena, which provokes relatively explicit social orientations in the form of social rules, expectations, and defined transgressions. As such, the close examination of parents media-related discourse during interviews provides insights on media ideologies within the home, and on the moral identities, and agency of family members in those contexts. Through ethnographically-informed discourse analysis of interviews with parents in dual-earner families in the greater Los Angeles area, this paper reveals that parents frequently struggle to present themselves as moral agents when discussing how they attempt to control and monitor their children's media exposure. They employ multiple strategies to portray themselves as ""doing the right thing"", adhering to an ideal moral image of parenthood. A particular focus is put on how parents construct their ideologies and identities through their discourses surrounding the moral challenges of childrens media use, and on how the collective voice of culture with its practices, preferences, and ideologies seems to permeate the individual's articulation of accountability vis-à-vis media exposure."

While MPAA-sanctioned surveys of parental support for the rating system have consistently shown parents are satisfied with the current system, increased criticism of the ratings by special interest groups, parents and film industry insiders has brought the system under a microscope. This pilot study was designed to further investigate parental use of and satisfaction with the MPAA rating system.
Focus groups were held with mothers and fathers of children of various ages. It was discovered that parents were unanimously dissatisfied with the system, pointing to its lack of clarity and consistency as the primary reasons for their dissatisfaction. Parents reported a desire for more specific content information to be included with rating designators, allowing them to make more informed decisions regarding the specific films they would allow their children to watch."

However, the elite discourse of politicians/parliamentarians provides only one angle on socio-political processes. In this paper, we propose to take a complementary focus on DISCOURSE ABOUT PARLIAMENT; i.e. on how political institutions/processes are constructed in lay discourse by members of the electorate. As discourse analysts, we are also centrally concerned with how such an (integrated) approach can illuminate the relationship between macro-level discourse and everyday modes of understanding, practical reasoning and representation. Hence, we adopt a dual focus on parliamentary discourse and community (focus-group) accounts of the Northern Irish Assembly (NIA) at a particular point in time; i.e. during a period of NIA suspension. As well as providing a lens on the socio-political situation, our analysis demonstrates the ongoing intersection and mutually shaping nature of community and political discourse. In particular, we highlight the ways in which grass-roots accounts of political life are informed by political/parliamentary discourse and its representation (e.g. in the media); and how political/parliamentary discourse is, in turn, reflective of community representations and orientations. In light of these observations, we discuss recent political developments in Northern Ireland  specifically, the accommodation reached by hard-line nationalists and unionists in May 2007, which allowed for the restoration of the NIA  and consider the extent to which political/discursive change is a top-down or a bottom-up process. We propose that this latter issue may be addressed in real time through further integrated analyses of political and community discourse."
2008-0979,"Parsing, Semantic Networks, and Political Authority: Using Syntactic Analysis to Extract Semantic Relations From Dutch Newspaper Articles",ymbolic Politics,,,,Paper,"Parsing, Semantic Networks, and Political Authority: Using Syntactic Analysis to Extract Semantic Relations From Dutch Newspaper Articles",Symbolic Politics,"Analysis of political communication is an important aspect of political research.
Thematic content analysis has yielded considerable success both with manual and
automatic coding, but Semantic Network Analysis has proven more difficult, both
for humans and for the computer.
This paper presents a system for an automated Semantic Network Analysis of
Dutch texts. The system automatically extracts relations between political actors
based on the output of syntactic analysis of Dutch newspaper articles. Specifically,
the system uses pattern matching to find source constructions and determine the
semantic agent and patient of relations. Subsequently, political actors are identified
using name matching and resolution of pronominal and NP-anaphora.
The performance of the system is judged by comparing the extracted relations to
manual codings of the same material. We present three validity measures:
Concurrent validity is defined as the agreement on the level of the units of
measurement, while construct validity and predictive validity are determined by a
comparison at the level of units of analysis. Overall, concurrent validity is found to
be acceptable (0.65 F-score), while the construct validity is good (correlation 0.83 and
0.61). The predictive validity is high. Tests of political communication hypotheses
regarding indexing, opportune witnesses and issue ownership reveal precisely the
same outcomes, regardless whether they are based on automated semantic network
analysis or on Semantic Network Analysis by human coders."

In addition to representing cutting edge science, nanotechnology is unique in requiring interdisciplinarity. While much scholarly attention has been focused on nano's marketing potential, there is far less research devoted to its social and cultural attributes. This research examines the social dynamics of the nanotechnology lab, and asks both nanotechnology and non-nanotechnology scientists to reflect on their laboratory experiences. Of interest: a) the percentage of women who are participating in nano; and b) the perceptions of women scientists regarding the inter-disciplinary culture of nanotechnology (e.g., the advantages/disadvantages of being a woman in a socially-driven research enterprise). Questions about collaboration, identification, and communication apprehension are included, as well as key success indicators such as publication numbers, lab and personal funding, and collaboration opportunities."

Drawing upon the case study La Carsa (A Mobile Tent on Art and Sexuality), this represents an innovative and dialogue and reflection-based approach to promoting youth sexual and reproductive health rights and gender equality, prevention of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, and increased demand of youth health services. Based on a variety of interpersonal communication activities implemented and evaluated as part of the strategy (participatory theater, invisible theater, debates, and collaborative art) the authors put forward a conceptual and intervention model that seeks to expand the boundaries of EE as a viable interpersonal communication strategy and work beyond the more conventional mass media-based approaches that have characterized EE to date."

This has been particularly the case with religious cultures. Their critiques of modernity and its values are most often centered around the mediatization of those values. Thus, the religiously-inflected discourses of the so-called culture wars are mediatized both on the side of religion and secularity, and mediatization is at the center of these struggles. As media and media rituals are themselves at the heart of culture (as argued by Couldry, 2003), the ways that meanings are made, negotiated, and represented places these questions near the center of the force and nature of secularization in late modernity. This paper investigates these issues in a specific context: the reception and meaning practices of media audiences. Drawing on findings from qualitative and interpretive field research, it will explore the meanings and boundaries that define distinctions between religious and non-religious symbols and representations in contemporary media culture. While these field data come from the U.S. context, the paper will suggest similarities and differences across North American and European contexts."

Patient treatment decision-making (TDM) has been widely studied, but we examined a less scrutinized topic: the role of partners in TDM. Constant comparative techniques guided an analysis of 35 interviews with cancer patients and partners. There are 9 typical TDM discussion tasks, from weighing the merits of different treatments to conversing about treatment-related satisfaction. Partners occupy 7 typical roles through the TDM process, including handling information and interacting with doctors. As partners can be a central part of the cancer experience, our study provides recommendations for the study and practice of couples dealing with cancer."
2008-0984,Passive Restrictions and All-Out Attacks: The Troubled Media Climate in Australia,Media Climate and Government Restrictions,,,,Paper,Passive Restrictions and All-Out Attacks: The Troubled Media Climate in Australia,Media Climate and Government Restrictions,"In 2007 Australia was rated by two international media bodies as well down the chain in media freedom. Within its own borders, internal media groups  in particular the Australian Press Council and the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, as well as a consortium of major employer groups  have recently released reports or are currently investigating the current position of media freedoms in the country. This paper takes a close look at some of these contracting freedoms which range from the passive restrictions on access to documents to the overt threat of imprisonment for publishing sensitive material. In particular, it considers laws relating to freedom of information, camera access to courts, the role of the courts information officer (or PIO), shield laws and whistleblower protection and finally, revamped anti terrorism laws. The paper maps the landscape of Australias downgraded press freedom and suggests that communication for social impact begins with the laws that control media reportage."

Through a series of frames enacted by the Minutemen and reinforced by the news stories, whiteness remained invisible while the threat toward whiteness became pronounced. The Minutemen embraced whiteness and literally policed its border, controlling the dialogue, and historically editing what did not fit with the narrative."

Using a refined version of Scott and Timmermans (2005) media use scale, participants reported the extent to which they used eight different communication media and the level of interdependence in the friendship. Results revealed four distinct factors of media use: Asynchronous Public Communication, Asynchronous Private Communication, Social Networking Communication, and Synchronous Offline Communication. Both sex and geographic distance differences emerged on these factors, and all factors except Asynchronous Private Communication predicted friendship interdependence. These findings clarify underlying patterns of media use and suggest that both privacy and orality are salient properties delineating media types."

This paper examines Lazarsfeld as an institutional innovator in higher education. Emphasis is placed on Lazarsfelds dependency on the business world for support of research that allowed the development of the world famous Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia University in New York, itself modelled on a research centre, the first of its kind in the world, that he had established in Vienna in 1925. Detailed attention is given to his attempt to transform the Bureau into a training centre for the whole of the social sciences in America, and his work with the Ford Foundation in establishing The Centre for Advanced Studies in the Behavioural Sciences at Palo Alto."

In this presentation, we use netnography to examine the exchanges that take place within YouTube's attention economy. Our study reveals how online ethnography can be adapted to the audiovisuality of the YouTube media, while still attending to the communal nature of the social interactions. Our netnography blends interpretive analysis with observational data and sixteen YouTube member interviews. Findings include the processes of value creation through the stimulated amplification of identities in interactions between fans and celebrities or through consumers and producers. The relevance of a netnographic methodology, and the way it adapts to the communal audiovisual context, are discussed.

Students assume a high level of responsibility, often leading campus-wide health promotion initiatives. Despite this important presence, however, the ways in which students experience their roles as peer health educatorsand how effective they believe themselves to be in reaching their fellow studentshas been largely overlooked. In an effort to address these questions, this paper presents an ethnographic analysis of a university-based peer health education group, the Peer Listening Line (PLL). Initial research revealed that the PLL, a student-run, confidential helpline, was confronted with several challenges during the past five years that threatened its existence; thus, research questions were considered in this context. This analysis describes how, when faced with adversity, PLL members cultivated three key relationshipswith the university administration, the larger student body, and the other members of the groupand, in so doing, were able to redefine and affirm their group identity."

Deception requires justification whereas honesty does not. Seeking to replicate the results of a laboratory experiment, the current study provides additional test of whether the veracity principle guides message choices across situations. It was hypothesized that people lie for a reason, and absent motivation to the contrary, honesty typically prevails. Participants (N = 66) completed questionnaires in which they selected from among deceptive and honest message options varying in motive to deceive. As predicted, deceptive messages were almost never selected when goals could be accomplished with honest messages. Alternatively, deceptive messages were often selected in situations where the truth posed a problem for goal attainment. The current data is consistent with the idea that people are usually deceptive for a reason and that people usually do not engage in deception when goals can be attained through honest means."

This study asked whether, and to what extent, efficacy beliefs serve as the underlying mechanisms in the relationship between social capital and HIV-prevention behaviors. It provides a first test of the differential predictive ability of two types of efficacy recently explicated by Bandura (2001): personal efficacy and proxy efficacy. It also asks whether the two types of efficacy are differentially associated with HIV-prevention behaviors that are aligned on a continuum ranging from individual action (practicing monogamy) to collective action (use of HIV services). Hypotheses, tested with a sample of Namibians (N = 300), were mostly supported. The role of personal efficacy ranged from r = -.18 (p < .05) for use of HIV services to r = .26 (p < .05) for practicing monogamy."

Most of the documented and suspected impacts on the quality of work life (QWL) are negative: Work becomes more intense, workers are displaced, surveillance increases, workers bargaining power declines, and workers skills (in many cases) become obsolete, devalued, or constrained by ICT-imposed structures. However, ICTs may also have positive effects on QWL, at least for some, by creating more interesting, high skill, complex, and higher paying jobs or when they are used to create high involvement work practices that increase meaningful participation for workers. Given this mix of potential effects, our research asked a deceptively simple question: On the whole, do workers perceive that the quality of work life as improving or deteriorating as a result of ICT adoption by their employers and by their work-related use of ICTs? Based on an analysis of 377 surveys from a wide range of people in New Zealand, we found that respondents who were most affected by ICTs (i.e., their employers adopted significant ICTs and they personally used ICTs for work-related purposes) were more satisfied with their work roles and pay than those less affected. Yet, they also perceived that their work had become more pressured than those less affected by ICTs."

This is significant because face concerns have been identified as critical in influencing individuals behaviors in social interactions. Significant gains have been made over the past decades on the influence of face threat in a variety of contexts. The purpose of this study is to advance our understanding of the influence of perceived face threat on classroom participation and the cultural variability. The paper argues that perceived face threat has influence on classroom participation, and individuals differ in the level of perceived face threat in classroom participation across cultures."

This study is two-fold. The first objective is to understand perceived gender credibility and gender appropriateness for a companys public representation. Second, this study aims to understand both mens and womens perceptions of the importance of physical attractiveness of both men and women in organizational settings. The results confirm that cultural determinants are important in shaping the main characteristics of public relations communicators. In Romania, men have a more traditional view of women, and both men and women believe that in organizational settings women should look attractive. Interestingly, the results revealed that neither men, nor women believe that the other sex is more credible in a spokespersons position. However, a higher percentage of men than women believe that women are better in public relations communicator positions. The results of this study may serve as a foundation for a new area of research  in the future, each company would choose its public communicator based on its targeted publics preference."

This study employs an ethnographic approach to interview a group of breast cancer survivors who not only have overcome the social stigma related to breast cancer, but also have been enthusiastically involved in activities to educate the public and advocate authorities for early diagnosis and prevention. Through a study of these womens experiences of fighting breast cancer, coupled with their stories about gaining social support, the researcher aims to examine the relationship between the changes in attitude toward breast cancer and the changes in American culture and society, generally, over the last decade. The presenter also explores the relational process of trust-building required to complete the study."

Not much is, however, known about how individuals relate to various personal technologies, their preferences for each, or their extensional associations with them. Even less is known about the cultural differences in these preferences. The current study used the Galileo system of multidimensional scaling to systematically map the extensional associations with nine personal communication technologies across three cultures: U.S., Germany, and Singapore. Across the three cultures, the technologies closest to the self were similar, suggesting a universality of associations with certain technologies. In contrast, the technologies farther from the self were significantly different across cultures. Moreover, the magnitude of associations with each technology differed based on the extensional association or distance from the self. Also, more important, the antecedents to these associations differed significantly across cultures, suggesting a stronger influence of cultural norms on personal technology choice."
2008-0997,Persuasion on the 'Net: A Synthetic Propositional Framework,Online Persuasion,,,,Paper,Persuasion on the 'Net: A Synthetic Propositional Framework,Online Persuasion,"Research investigating influence on the Internet commonly presume that influential interpersonal cues commonly associated with source credibility and status are filtered out of computer-mediated interaction. Other theories of influence on the Internet argue that some social cues, specifically information about group affiliation, cause individuals to rely primarily on the normative influence associated with their salient group identification as a guide to behavior. This paper traces some of the boundary conditions under which one may expect various computer-mediated communication (CMC) theories to obtain. Further, this paper utilizes a dual-process framework and synthesizes research pertaining to CMC theories in order to generate several sets of propositions about persuasive outcomes. Finally, this paper suggests next steps for researchers examining persuasion in CMC."

Much of this research has, however, been inconsistent in its treatment of key constructs and its methodological approaches. The current study takes a stricter approach and tracks the pre and post adoption beliefs of physicians provided with an actual PDA within a single healthcare facility in the US. Results reveal that age, position in hospital, beliefs about health IT, and cluster ownership are significant, direct predictors of the physicians pre-adoption beliefs about PDAs. Contrary to prior research findings, both ease of use and usefulness perceptions significantly influenced the physicians intent to adopt PDAs. More important, results show that physicians focus on a broader range of PDA factors during pre-adoption assessment of the technology while actual use is based solely on the PDAs ease of use. Moreover, the pre-adoption usefulness perceptions do not influence post-adoption usefulness. Hence, the cognitive and affective determinants of intent to use are seemingly different from those used to evaluate PDA use."

Specifically, this study examined if physicians perceive first-person, second-person, or third-person effects of DTC advertising on the physician-patient interaction, what factors are related with different types of person-effects, and how first-person, second-person, and third-person effect perceptions differentially influence physician behaviors. The survey results provide interesting insight into different person-effect perceptions and behavioral consequences."

On one hand, providing quality medical care requires the physician to elicit accurate and comprehensive information about patients health and life circumstances. On the other hand, eliciting information about a potentially delicate matter may endanger the physician-patient relationship, particularly if the patient feels embarrassed, threatened, or judged. I see the design of the physicians queries as a significant factor in how those dynamics play out. One potentially relevant issue in the design of physicians' queries is the presence/absence of presuppositions.
In the analysis that follows, I show how the activity framework of comprehensive history taking provides for the avoidance of potentially problematic presuppositions by enabling the use of minimized, fragmentary information seeking formulations. I also discuss the tradeoffs this may involve with respect to obtaining an accurate, comprehensive history."

It asks what kind of voters used the selectors, how they perceive their democratic functions and whether or not selectors appeared to mobilize new groups of citiizens in politics. Insight into selector use can inform theories about the Internet?s potential to generate more inclusive and participatory political cultures versus its potential to rigidify of deepen existing gaps favoring those rich in mateiral and information resources. The study finds that those who use selectors most frequently are younger, better educated, most politically interested and, perhaps most interestingly, most certain about their party preferences. In other words, there is little support for the notion that selectors as they appeared in the Swedish 2006 campaign were instruments of increasing mobilization or providing new knowledge.

Sound bites are defined as film segments within a news story that show someone speak without interruption. The study goes beyond traditional sound bites research by also examining each statement?s content, context of use in the campaign and context of use in the story. Image bites are defined as film segments within a news story in which someone is shown but not heard. They have been largely neglected in previous research despite the fact that visual depictions convey important political cues about a candidate?s fitness for office. Image bites were also coded for their content and context. Based on the results (which were gathered with an identical instrument, equivalent samples and coordinated coding in four countries) this study comes to five generalizing conclusions: (1.) that the factors that are in particular responsible for decreasing sound bite lengths are commercial influences and public relations influences; (2.) that the presence of candidates in the news is twice as high as sound bite research has hitherto accounted for in the literature ? if one includes the neglected unit of image bites; (3.) that the use of ever shorter sound bites is not a specifically American experience; (4.) that the use of image bites shows no indication of a cynical reporting style; and (5.) that in Europe the reporting styles of public and private broadcasters are increasingly converging, and are becoming more similar to trends observed in the United States."

Students and laborers took a day away from their studies and jobs to demonstrate the importance of undocumented workers to Americas economy. Many of the individuals were from Mexico, but not all. However, Anglo broadcast news media focused primarily on the experiences of Mexican and Latin American workers, positioning the day as a tide of humanity, a mass of

This study builds on Santa Anas work that examines Latino representations and metaphor, applying it to the analysis of visual text in news broadcasts about Americas Day without Immigrants. Through the lens of postcolonial visual and mythological theory illustrative images from ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, and CNN news are examine according to the discourse used to characterize groups of immigrants as threatening waves, hence a natural disaster."

Different kinds of exposed signs constitute essential means of equipment for the environments we are dwelling in and for individual persons. As some studies have stressed out the importance of emplacement and indexicality per se, we propose to switch the look and analyze the activity of workers in charge of signs placement. An ethnography of subway signs installation allows us to shed light on their invisible work that involves heterogeneous ways to treat signs. We assume that placement work enact different pragmatical properties for situated signs. According to circumstances, subway signs can be grasped as texts, indexes, landmarks, objects, part of a network and as a normative stake. For the signs perfomativity to be actualized, workers have to mobilize a composite knowledge that prioritize and articulate in situation these semiotics properties."
2008-1007,Plato on the Break Boundary: Implications for the Digital Revolution,The Bias of Digital Communication,,,,Paper,Plato on the Break Boundary: Implications for the Digital Revolution,The Bias of Digital Communication,"Plato was the ""break boundary"" between ""the written and oral traditions,"" explained Marshall McLuhan. A ""representative of the new literate culture of ancient Greece,"" he nonetheless ""lived in a double world,"" and from this frontier ""translated the tribal encyclopedia of the preceding culture into the written, classified form."" McLuhan's deep interest in the communication technologies utilized by ancient Greek oral culture was influenced by the work of Harold Innis and other scholars associated with the theoretical foundations of media studies. McLuhan built on Innis's method of using historical situations as a lab for testing the character of technology in shaping culture. Thus, Plato's role in the Literate Revolution became the model for the transformation in cognition and culture in the Gutenberg and Electric Revolutions. Innis had warned of a blindness to the bias or distorting power of the prevailing technology of communication. We should therefore anticipate that the dominance of literate modes of communication in our culture had a distorting effect on hypotheses concerning the shift from oral to literate media in the ancient world, and this will in turn have implications for our understanding of the Digital Revolution. The analysis in this study confirms the argument that Plato's dialogues represent a frontier and doubleness, even as it urges a more nuanced interpretation of the encounter between oral and written cultures. I explain the implications of these findings for the study of subsequent revolutions in communication technology, focusing in particular on the Digital Revolution underway today."
2008-1008,"Playbills, Promotions, and the Great Audience in 19th-Century American Theatre",cholar to Scholar: Communication History Interest Group Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Paper,"Playbills, Promotions, and the Great Audience in 19th-Century American Theatre",Scholar to Scholar: Communication History Interest Group Interactive Paper Poster Session,"In assessing the impact of radio and film in the first decades of the 20th Century, historians have implicitly or explicitly assumed that a mass audience emerged with the introduction of those revolutionary mediums and their intersection with the more mature newspaper and photography industries. But what Carey calls The Great Audience was emerging in the 19th Century and was poised to respond to the new technology-driven environment. The American theatre was a primary incubator for this audience.

This paper examines existing texts that reflect the promotional activities of theatre management circa 1840. Original documents  primarily theatre playbills -- from the era offer direct evidence of how theatre owners and managers came to recruit, address and respond to the first permanent audience for popular art. In so doing they constructed identities for the product (plays), the distribution system (the theatres) and the customers (theatre-goers). The original documents were examined at the Harry Ransom Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

The paper focuses on four issues. First, the state of the theatre in New York City during the 1830s-1840s. Second, audiences and audience behavior in the theatres. Third, the promotions, announcements and other notations that reflect how theatre entrepreneurs perceived the emerging audience. Fourth, the way the plays themselves were received by audiences. The paper will also offer some general comments comparing institutional practices and audiences in the 19th Century theatre with contemporary institutional practices in the American entertainment industry."

Digital games are emerging as a new medium for social change. Drawing upon the theory of role-taking and empathy, this study investigated the influence of presentation mode afforded by different media on empathic reactions in the context of humanitarian aid. An online experiment demonstrated that playing the Darfur is Dying game had greater influence on peoples empathic reactions (e.g., intention to donate money to help) towards the Darfurian than reading a news story about the crisis in Darfur. Role-taking was found to be the mediating mechanism for the effect. Implications of research on serious games for social change were discussed."
2008-1010,Playing a Health Video Game: Impacts of Social Interaction and Gender on Health Outcomes,Games and Audience,,,,Paper,Playing a Health Video Game: Impacts of Social Interaction and Gender on Health Outcomes,Games and Audience,"This study identifies attitudinal effects of playing a health education video game on pairs of young adults where one member of the pair plays the video game and the other member watches the game being played. The effects of social interaction and gender during video game play are tested by a 2 (experimemtal condition: player/observer) x 2 (participant gender: male/female) x 2 (gender of partner: male/female) experimental design (N = 106). The gender of players and their observers significantly predicts attitudinal outcomes after playing a cancer education video game entitled Re-Mission. Re-Mission teaches players about cancer and its medical treatments while they control a character who travels through the bodies of cancer patients to deliver chemotherapy treatment. The gender of players and their observers did not predict the strength of participants intentions to prevent cancer in the future. However, male players experienced increased optimism about chemotherapy outcomes when considering potential cancer diagnoses in the future, but only when being observed by a female partner. Male players rated the games appeal more highly than did female players, but only when they had been observed by another male. There was no effect of gender among female players and observers, however. The distinct influences of female observers versus male observers on male players seem to be consistent with stereotypic gender roles, where female observers may be considered a nurturing presence and male observers seem to be a competitive presence during video game play. More research is needed in order to confirm this trend."
2008-1011,Political Advertising: How Much Germany and Poland Have in Common?,cholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Paper,Political Advertising: How Much Germany and Poland Have in Common?,Scholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,"Using content analysis the study scrutinizes political ads in Germany and Poland. The author compares political broadcasts presented in the last three parliamentary campaigns in both countries. The commercials are particularly useful as they show how the process of mediatization of politics is reflected in political campaigning. Furthermore, party spots represent pure messages sent by political parties and the content of commercials is not affected or abridged by journalists-gatekeepers. Finally, party broadcasts show how parties themselves anticipate and express political culture in their own country and how their campaigning might be influenced by political system characteristics. The study proposes four hypotheses to examine how the characteristics of the political systems influence the format and content of political commercials. The first part outlines the essential features of political systems in both countries. In the second step the design of the study, proposed hypotheses and coding instruments are presented. Finally, the third part reports the results of conducted content analysis showing the differences in political advertising between Polish and German ads."

The paper proposes to bring personal actors back in and to focus on the attitudes and values of journalists and politicians on the national level with regard to their interaction in different institutional settings. On the basis of functionally equivalent samples of 300 elite journalists and political actors the cultural underpinnings of the politics-media relationship will be systematically compared across seven European countries. The paper will present preliminary empirical findings showing how concepts as commercialization of the media, the advent of journalists as critical experts, a growing role of opinion polls etc. are reflected in the perceptions and attitudes of journalists. Furthermore, it tries to uncover how their professional attitudes relate to some of their entrenched political and social norms and values. By comparing across countries, we expect that, while political communication cultures are surely not entirely different, they nevertheless vary cross-culturally as they reflect specific systemic features."

The two neighboring Asian countries, Taiwan and South Korea, also followed the trend of medial liberalization, adopting Western free market economy into their media industry and allowing the startup of cable television service. These two countries exhibit a number of similarities in their media system and media reform process. Although two countries feature many similarities in their media reform process, a general explanation using a brush term media deregulation is insufficient in accounting for differences in their regulatory process and the market structure and performance of cable broadcasting industries. This study employed political economy approach to investigate factors that contributed to the different policy outcomes and patterns in two countries. The differences are attributable to the different regulatory, political, and economic environments under which cable television services in two countries emerged and operated. This study concludes that Taiwan and South Korea have responded differently to revamp their broadcasting market structure and characterizes the path to broadcasting reform in Taiwan as deregulation and in South Korea as re-regulation."
2008-1015,Political Journalism in Transitional Democracies: A Comparative Perspective,"Comparative Research on the Cultures of Journalism: New Studies, Approaches, and Evidence",,,,Paper,Political Journalism in Transitional Democracies: A Comparative Perspective,"Comparative Research on the Cultures of Journalism: New Studies, Approaches, and Evidence","One of the most persistent problems of many new democracies is the failure to transform the institutions and practices of political journalism. Continuous political interference into newsmaking on the one hand, and lack of journalistic professionalism and responsibility on the other create an unusually high level of conflict between governments and the media. However, the particular conflicts and the way in which they are negotiated differ significantly across countries. This paper argues that different pathways of democratization result in different patterns of political journalism. In other words, the roles of the media under the old regime in conjunction with the constraints of transition help us to understand the problems journalists are facing after regime changes. The paper takes a global perspective by comparing experiences from Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. Particular emphasis will be laid on media-state relationships, the quality of news reporting and journalistic values. The paper concludes that conventional models of political journalism cannot be easily applied outside established western democracies. Instead, new hybrid forms of political communication are emerging in new democracies that blend liberal ideals with indigenous values and practices."

An Overview of Regressive Alternative Media in Canada,"Alternative Media: Policy, Politics, and Practice",,,,Paper,Politically Incorrect and Proud of It! An Overview of Regressive Alternative Media in Canada,"Alternative Media: Policy, Politics, and Practice","While studies on alternative media have increased exponentially in the last ten years both in Canada and the United States, they have tended to focus on what John Downing calls radical media, defined as those media that express an alternative vision to hegemonic policies, priorities, and perspectives (Downing 2001:v). Recognizing that these visions can also be radically negative (Ibid:ix), this paper contributes to political communication research by providing an overview of a range of this kind of media in Canada as they exist today. Making a distinction between progressive media  policies and practices that aim to alleviate or eliminate social relations of oppression and domination, and regressive media  those which facilitate and entrench such relations, the paper employs case study methodology and critical discourse analyses to identify how this regression is articulated across both historical and new media examples."
2008-1017,Political News Media Interviews as Agonistic Encounters,Textures of the Public Sphere,,,,Paper,Political News Media Interviews as Agonistic Encounters,Textures of the Public Sphere,"This article analyzes the nature of the dialogue of broadcast news media interviews and their public dissemination and argues that political interviews are fundamentally contestable and indeterminate encounters. In contrast to Habermas theory of communicative action and journalistic accounts that see conflict and disagreement in news media interviews as problems that need to be minimized and overcome, this article states that the dialogical account of language employed in the work of Bakhtin and Voloinov and agonistic political theory more accurately capture the communicative dynamics of news media interviews. It follows that the function of journalistic interviewers should be cast less in terms of producing consensus and mutual understanding and more in terms of keeping the political open."
2008-1018,Political Reporting in Poland: What Has Changed Over the Last Decade?,"Journalism, Citizens, and the State",,,,Paper,Political Reporting in Poland: What Has Changed Over the Last Decade?,"Journalism, Citizens, and the State","In cannot be questioned that the media has become the main source of information about politics and deprived political parties of the information functions they once possessed (Esser & Pfetsch, 2004). The growing intrusion of media into the political domain has led some scholars to describing this phenomenon as media-driven republic, in which media usurps the traditional functions of political actors. Thus media is seen as having mutagenic impact on politics and the ability to change political discourse (Mazzoleni & Schulz, 1999:248). However, intrusion can vary substantially between single analyzed countries. This paper analyzes how political reporting has changed over time in the Gazeta Wyborcza, the Rzeczpospolita and the Super Express, Polands widely read newspapers. The author content analyzed the political coverage during the four weeks prior to parliamentary elections in 1997, 2001 and 2005. The first part briefly outlines the political background in Poland. In the second step, analyzed newspapers and their role in the transformation processes are discussed. Thirdly, the study proposes four research questions and explores how mediatization processes are manifested in political reporting of the newly established Polish democracy. Using content analysis the author measures the extent of media coverage on party campaigning, the level of personalization, the use of negativity in depicturing themes and political parties and political orientations of the analyzed media. This study is the first attempt to bring any empirical data on political reporting in Poland over a longer period of time and similar analyses have not yet been published."
2008-1019,Politicians in the Media: Determinants of Legislators' Presence and Prominence in Swiss Newspapers,cholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Paper,Politicians in the Media: Determinants of Legislators' Presence and Prominence in Swiss Newspapers,Scholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,"In times of increasing mediatization of politics (e.g. Mazzoleni and Schulz 1999), when voters experience politics primarily through the media and politicians who wish to address the public are forced to conform to the medias rules and constraints (e.g. Altheide and Snow 1979), the question of who gets into the news and why becomes of the outmost importance. Many studies have shown that media attention is unequally distributed and biased towards state actors and resource-rich (business) interest groups, who get preferential access to the media (e.g. Danielian and Page 1994, Gans 1979). It is however less clear how the media select their sources within the group of highly relevant political state actors such as parliamentarians. This contribution addresses the question of the determinants of legislators presence and prominence in Swiss newspapers by focusing on three competing approaches drawn from communication studies. The first approach regards the media as a mirror of political reality and argues that deputies prominence in the media is proportional to their degree of parliamentarian activity. Second, news values theory predicts that important politicians who occupy particular functions in the political system get most visibility in the media. Third, theories of news bias focus on factors such as political orientations or socio-demographic attributes and hold that the media privilege those politicians who are close to their own editorial profile. The empirical relevance of these approaches is tested on original data from quantitative content analyses of four Swiss newspapers by means of multivariate statistical techniques."
2008-1020,Politics 2.0: Agenda-Setting in New Media Contexts,Wikis for Politics,,,,Paper,Politics 2.0: Agenda-Setting in New Media Contexts,Wikis for Politics,"Scholars have long sought to delineate how and why some political issues appear in the news, while others remain obscure. Most agree the media tacitly employs some set of ""agenda setting"" selection principles in determining its coverage, and that those who want their issues covered become familiar with these filters.

What's less clear is whether this is unique to the mass media, or whether the same process of filtering and claim-adaptation turns up in new media spaces. In short, is ""newsworthiness"" unique to the news? Or is the desire to frame issues as dramatic, succinct stories a more universal feature of human communication?

This study is a content analysis examining the form of political discussion across different online architectureshere, the WikiCandidate research project and the popular blog, Daily Koswhich seeks to determine whether filters that determine the news media agenda recur endogenously in online discussion and collaboration."

This study investigates what underlies peoples cable news choices by analyzing their perceptions of FOX and CNN. Using data gathered from the 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, this paper confirms that many people have chosen sides, finding one of these cable news networks to be far more trustworthy than the other. These individuals have demographic and political characteristics that distinguish them from others who trust both CNN and FOX and from others who distrust both CNN and FOX. This study also finds that trust mediates the relationship between peoples political predispositions and their cable news exposure habits. Both trusting ones preferred outlet and distrusting an alternative outlet motivate peoples exposure patterns."

Despite the faddish enthusiasm about the democratic potential of online social networks in political campaign practices, little systematic research has conducted with regard to the effects of online social networks on voting behavior. The present study first attempted to explore how online social networks would influence voting. This study theorizes the New Voting Reward Model by revising Downss original voting model (1957). In consideration of the unique nature of the new information environment, the New Voting Reward Model includes both individual and collective motivational factors as predictor of the probability of voting. A survey of 416 young voters revealed that online social network usage contributed to explaining the probability of voting by 5.8%. Furthermore, political use of online social networks was positively associated with self-efficacy, social capital, as well as civic duty. Implications of online social networks for the transformation of political leadership strategies were discussed."

US soldiers, independent journalists, armchair pundits, tenured Arabists, and Iraqi citizens posted hundreds of thousands of words online using self-publishing software. This proliferation was heralded in many quarters  and particularly in the mainstream media -- as evidence of new medias democratic potential. But the question of the political significance of these interventions remains undecided. Drawing on analysis of over 65 war blogs and in-depth interviews with ten war bloggers carried out as part of the Rethinking Media, Democracy, and Citizenship project, this paper will show that many bloggers articulate competing notions of democracy, and political agency, modeled on either the town hall or consumer activity in the society of the spectacle (Hardt and Negri, 2004). Appealing to Jodi Deans concept of communicative capitalism (Dean, 2008), I will argue that both models frustrate unequivocal claims that war bloggers have represented either a deepening of democratic discourse or effective tactical engagement with the US administrations war narrative.

Technlogical Change and Popular Communication","The research from which this paper will be drawn investigates teen consumption of media and popular culture within the everyday environment of a British secondary school. One of the projects aims is to examine the use value and also symbolic value of media and popular culture for different teen consumers, in relation to everyday social interactions and social processes. Our ethnographic research demonstrates that conversational references to techno-popular culture and also the use of media technologies such as mobile phones and MP3 players are frequent. These activities are significant within a range of social processes: peer alliances, involvement in and disaffection from curricular activities and an individuals positioning within the stratified ecology of the classroom. This paper will also explore the relationship between media and popular culture and the school curricular culture. The potential for such research to offer insights to education and media policy makers will be argued."
2008-1026,Populist Rhetoric of a Hegemonic Intervention,"Race, Territory, Politics",,,,Paper,Populist Rhetoric of a Hegemonic Intervention,"Race, Territory, Politics","This paper is an analysis of the hegemonic intervention in Danish public discourse by the extreme Right in 1986. The far right?s campaign in mid-80s substantially changed the way social divisions are envisioned in Denmark, where culture, ethnicity and religion are now the signifiers of social distinctions rather than class, gender or other types of differences. What we are witnessing in Denmark and Europe is more than the normalization of racist views: it is about ethnicization of the whole field of social formations. Ethnicity/culture ? and specifically Islam ? has become the master signifier for the main controversy around which the issues of identity, globalization, and the welfare system are discussed and (re)articulated. The ?culturalization? of discourse pushed the entire political spectrum to the right.
The question is: how did a single figure, S?Krarup, a priest known for his far right views, gain almost unlimited access to discourse and achieved a long-lasting influence on the ontology of the social? A big part of the answer lies in his construction of the Danish people ? the so-called silent majority ? against a dictatorial political elite who were about to destroy Denmark. The main argument is that the moral panics around the numbers of incoming refugees created a deep hegemonic crisis that provided an opportunity for Krarup to present himself as the representative of the ?silenced? masses. The paper is a discussion of the discursive environment that made possible his intervention."

A quantitative content analysis was conducted on 607 television commercials that won the Taiwan Times Advertising Award from 1999 to 2004. The findings showed that, while the mature market adults were generally portrayed in the positive way, their incidence of portrayal  especially for women  were underrepresented in Taiwans award-winning television commercials. Conclusions are advanced about trends in Taiwan advertising portrayals of the mature market and implications for advertising practitioners are suggested."

In an experimental setting, twenty-two male and forty-two female undergraduates interacted
in two tasks with a morphed embodied agent in a virtual environment. Whereas most previous
work on facial similarity employed morphing techniques concerning 2D faces, the present study
used techniques to create morphs in 3D. In one task the embodied agent was facially dissimilar,
and in the other task the embodied agent was facially similar to the participant.
Results showed that, when paired with high quality advice, facial similarity increased
involvement of all participants and boosted the use intentions of male participants.
However, when facial similarity was paired with low quality advice,
male participants preferred to use a facially dissimilar agent.
Results suggest that designers need to be cautious using self-similar agents in interfaces."

These initiatives include rural tele-centers, GPS navigation devices for fishing communities, and the use of computers in village schools and community centers.
The fieldwork, conducted in February 2007, included 46 in-depth interviews and a survey covering 250 respondents. The study covered fisher folk, village opinion leaders, youth and parents, students and teachers of computer science, and World Vision program officers in the selected sites.
The results indicate selected localized benefits, along with a greater familiarity with technology, which helped normalize living conditions after the disaster. The longer-term issue of sustainability needs to be addressed. Technological and aid dependence are partially offset by technical training and group involvement at the local level respectively. This systemic program of ICT integration for rural communities has broader relevance for ICT planning."
2008-1030,"Power and Affiliation in Presidential Press Conferences: A Study on Interruptions, Jokes, and Laughter",News and Politics,,,,Paper,"Power and Affiliation in Presidential Press Conferences: A Study on Interruptions, Jokes, and Laughter",News and Politics,"The Presidential press conference is an enduring and legitimate form for public interrogations and political accountability. It is a prestigious arena for journalists to display their professional ways of asking questions. Interaction in the context of press conferences regulates and symbolizes relations of power, autonomy and affiliation between the President and the journalists. A general argument in this paper is that we have to study not only the design of questions, but different aspects of sequences of interaction in order to understand the roles and relations established in press conferences. The paper investigates two types of sequences of interaction in which roles and relations are brought to its head: (1) Interruptions, (2) Jokes and laughter. The study is based on Conversation Analysis and the data encompasses 19 solo press conferences held by George W Bush from 2005-2007. The study shows that 86 percent of all (151) the interruptions are made by the President. This indicates a general pattern of dominance, but also that the President uses interruptions as a resource in a number of situations. The analysis shows how the President uses interruptions in order to control the allocation of turns, disagree and reject criticism, demonstrate certainty and conviction, and makes joke with the journalists. In fact, sequences of jokes and laughter occur quite frequently. Those sequences strengthen the interactive power of the President, and limit the interrogative resources of the journalists. The sequences of jokes and laughter also create affiliations, questioning the expected neutrality and non-alignment of journalism."

In many contextsfrom the US, where religious interests have sought (and achieved) ascendancy in political culture, to the Middle East, where a variety of formal theocracies predominate, the role of media and mediation are increasingly central. This paper will explore these evolving power relations and investigate the major competing claims: that either the media function to reinforce the cultural centrality of religion, or that they will inevitably undermine it.

Stewart M. Hoover's research concentrates on qualitative studies of media
audiences. He is particularly interested in questions of communication and
culture and the implications of media technologies and technological change.
His work has focused on meaning and identity as constructed through media
practice in the context of domestic and everyday life. He is particularly
well known for his work on religion and media, looking most recently at how
the realm of mediated popular and commercial culture serves as a context for
meaning-making of the kinds traditionally (though no longer necessarily)
thought of as ""religious."" He has received major research funding to carry
out studies and explorations of these issues and has been actively involved
in developing an international scholarly discourse on religion and media. He
is the author of four books and the co-editor of three others. He holds
masters and PhD degrees from the University of Pennsylvania."
2008-1032,Power Asymmetry and Network Structure in Open Source Community,Communication and Technology Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,Power Asymmetry and Network Structure in Open Source Community,Communication and Technology Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"Open Source Software (OSS) development challenges our traditional theories of organization and human production, and debate on the presence of hierarchy in OSS persists. This research theorizes OSS community as a network organization, and extends knowledge on OSS by empirically examining two mechanisms of network formation of the OSS developer affiliation network. We extracted BitTorrent developer network from the SourceForge.net data archive, in which nodes are developers and links are defined as joint membership on the same projects. Attribute data on leadership roles, reputation, and experience with SourceForge were also collected. We used the p* social selection model to make inferences about structural parameters, actor attributes and the network structure. Results show that project leaders and reputation do not translate into structural power. The results also suggest that homophily mechanism predicts network formation in that developers tend to connect with people with similar level of reputation."
2008-1033,"Power Feminism, Mediated: Girl Power and the Commercial Politics of Change","Girls, Children, and Media Power",,,,Paper,"Power Feminism, Mediated: Girl Power and the Commercial Politics of Change","Girls, Children, and Media Power","Power feminism and girl power are two concepts which have received much media attention in the past decade. The former was popularized by Naomi Wolfs (1993) bestselling book, Fire With Fire, while the latter was popularized by the music of the Spice Girls and by television programming in the latter half of the 1990s. Power feminism and girl power have typically appealed to young women and to girls, respectivelyoften appealing most strongly to those who have eschewed the term feminism. However, power feminism and girl power are difficult to reconcile with the more critical strands of feminist theory and activism, in part because power feminism and girl power embrace individualism, consumerism, and normative femininity. In this essay, the author theorizes about the relationship between power feminism and girl power by exploring the intertwining course run by power feminism and girl power in the commercial marketplace. Interrogating the problematic aspects of girl powers power feminist discourse in popular and material culture, the author charts how power feminist discourse has been manifested in girl power texts and products. The conclusions of this essay have implications for scholars concerned with how the politics of commercial media and marketing shape cultural conceptions of feminism."
2008-1034,Powerful News Frames? The Role of Prior Judgments as a Moderator of Framing Effects,Understanding Personal Cognitions in the Framing Process,,,,Paper,Powerful News Frames? The Role of Prior Judgments as a Moderator of Framing Effects,Understanding Personal Cognitions in the Framing Process,"Most studies documenting powerful framing effects have applied a tabula-rasa-model of framing, ignoring the role of prior judgments. However, citizens have formed judgments about most issues before, and stored them in memory. These prior judgments should influence framing effects differently, depending on whether they are on-line or memory-based. This idea is tested in a 2x2 panel-experiment. Subjects were exposed to a news frame (episodic or thematic) and their judgment formation was manipulated (on-line or memory-based). After a distraction, subjects were confronted with an opposing frame and attitude change was measured. Results show that, in contrast to individuals with memory-based judgments, individuals with on-line judgments were not influenced by subsequent media frames. It can be concluded that it is not the prior judgment per se that is crucial to framing effects, but the type of the prior judgment. Results are discussed in terms of the power and limits of framing effects."

Virtual characters are used to mask out clues to the nationality of actors while displaying their real movement behavior. Animations were based on movement protocols transcribed from dyadic role-play interactions recorded in three different countries: Germany, USA and UAE. The role players had to cope with a managerial conflict situation between a leader and an employee. Five computer animated interaction sequences from each country were shown to 95 German participants each evaluating one of the actors. Stereotype influence was controlled by either announcing or not announcing the nationality of the actors before displaying the interaction sequences. The results show significant differences in the observers judgments of the cultural samples, which were not influenced by the pre-information thus indicating a prominent influence of the nonverbal behavior."

Armed with a video-camera, we have been shadowing heads of mission in charge of managing various MSF interventions throughout the world (Democratic Republic of Congo, Jordan, Sri Lanka). Our objective is to depict what we call, a humanitarian organization in action, that is, all the organizational aspects involved in this type of mission, whether through the form of representation to the local authorities, management of the daily activities and coordination with the Parisian headquarters. In this panel, we will talk of the study results that were shared with MSF management team in order to illustrate to what extent LSI perspectives can be useful to practitioners. As we will show, LSI strength lies in the concrete and incarnated character of our findings."

The CCLS began in 1960 when 856 third graders (436 males, 420 females) in Columbia County, NY, were studied. Follow-up assessments were conducted in 1970 when the participants were age 19, in 1981 at age 30, and most recently in 2000 at age 48. Analyses of these data show that childhood exposure to violent television correlates significantly positively with aggression in childhood and adolescence (p < .01), but not directly with aggression in middle or late adulthood though those correlate with concurrent violence exposure (p < .02). However, structural equation analyses suggest that exposure to media violence in childhood does have lasting effects into adulthood when other contextual and personal factors are taken into account statistically."
2008-1038,Predicting User Concerns About Online Privacy in Hong Kong,Technology and Privacy,,,,Paper,Predicting User Concerns About Online Privacy in Hong Kong,Technology and Privacy,"Empirical studies on peoples online privacy concerns have largely been conducted in the West. The global threat of privacy violations on the Internet calls for similar studies to be done in non-Western regions. To fill this void, the current study develops a path model to investigate the influence of peoples Internet use-related factors, their beliefs in the right to privacy, and psychological need for privacy on Hong Kong peoples concerns about online privacy. Survey responses from 332 university students were analyzed. Results from this study show that peoples belief in the right to privacy was the most important predictor of their online privacy concerns. It also significantly mediated the relationship between peoples psychological need for privacy and their concerns with privacy violations online. Moreover, while frequent use of the Internet may increase concerns about online privacy issues, Internet use diversity may actually reduce such worries. The final model, well supported by the observed data, successfully explained twenty-five percent of the variability in user concerns about online privacy."
2008-1039,Prediction of Print and Online Newspaper Readership From Indices of News Quality,Who Uses Local News and Why,,,,Paper,Prediction of Print and Online Newspaper Readership From Indices of News Quality,Who Uses Local News and Why,"This secondary analysis of a representative sample from respondents in 27 American cities shows that peoples perceptions of local news quality and their preferences for new media features (represented by cell phones and access to broadband) is highly predictive on readership of local print newspapers. Only the new media features are predictive of readership of those newspapers websites, except in one city where a concerted effort has been made to develop the website and drive traffic to it. In that city, website readership is strongly predicted by the news quality variables. The Media Choice Model, which combines demographics, news quality perceptions, and preference for new media features thus is provided as further support for its utility."
2008-1040,"Prenatal Testing, Disability, and Termination: An Examination of Newspaper Frames",High Density: Media Influences on Health,,,,Paper,"Prenatal Testing, Disability, and Termination: An Examination of Newspaper Frames",High Density: Media Influences on Health,"While advances in screening for genetic characteristics may enable individuals to make decisions regarding their own health, prenatal screening also extends to pregnant women and their partners the ability to make decisions affecting the health and viability of their unborn fetuses. With potential decision making comes the need for information. Recently, scholars have been concerned with how genetic information is presented, as well as what types of effects that presentation might have. Within this body of literature, however, little work has examined the specific media content of prenatal testing for disabilities. Given the increase in the prevalence of prenatal testing for disabilities, and the options following positive test results, this study, a content analysis, investigates how information about prenatal testing and disability is reported in the top 30 newspaper markets in the United States. Using a sample of 148 full-text articles, findings overall indicate that disability is represented in negative terms, which is simultaneously paired with positive representations of prenatal testing, and to a slightly lesser extent, positive representations of termination of pregnancies involving a fetus diagnosed with disabilities."

A particularly pressing challenge currently facing public health officials is pandemic preparedness. In keeping with the conference theme and to extend this important area of inquiry, this paper analyses the construction of fear and uncertainty in press releases issued by the worlds leading health agencies, the Centers for Disease Control, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, and the World Health Organization, in order to reveal the internal/organizational, mass communicative, and interpersonal challenges and strategies employed by public information officers at these agencies as they prepare for a possible avian flu pandemic. Analysis of the content of the releases is a necessary first step in order to reveal the effects of their messages on audiences, specifically with regard to how fear and uncertainty are constructed within them. Thus, Berger and Calabreses (1975) Uncertainty Reduction Theory and Gudykunsts (1988) work on Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory theoretically frame this analysis. Results indicate that public health communicators may need to more mindful of a balance between fear-inducing and uncertainty-reducing information in their media releases. This study makes an important first and exploratory step in revealing how the media releases of the agencies construct the threat of avian flu and reveals threats therein to self-efficacy, a critical determinant of reducing risk during health crisis."

However, much insight gleaned from scholarly research in this area remains descriptive rather than prescriptive. Therefore, the current experimental study provided the first empirical test of Benoits (1995; 1997) five image restoration strategies vis-à-vis each other simultaneously within the context of a single crisis situation. Results indicated that the strategy of reducing the offensiveness of the crisis consistently led to higher reputation-related perceptions of a company than did the other four strategies when implemented during a product-harm (food recall) situation. Such inquiry accelerates the transfer of image restoration theory from the realm of retrospection and description to that of prescription and inference, while simultaneously providing clearer guidelines to practitioners regarding crisis-response communication strategies."

The relationship between arousal and presence was also analyzed with their effects on memory in a 3D video game (Half-Life 2). Results indicated that both manipulations of realistic cues of violence (red blood and screams of pain) increased the players arousal regardless of the users level of game experience, and the arousal had a significant relationship with engagement by affecting presence strongly. Especially, presence (engagement) was stronger than other variables in explaining the memory effect, and the engagement mediated the effect between arousal and memory. However, first-person perspective showed negative effects on both arousal and presence."

Male and female middle school students (N = 260) participated in this study, which included measures of attitude toward smoking, subjective norm, prior smoking experience, and association with deviant peers. Results revealed that both prior smoking experience and association with deviant peers predict adolescent smoking intentions both directly and indirectly through the mediation of attitude and/or subjective norms."
2008-1046,Privacy Reconsidered: A Conceptual Redefinition in the Context of Journalism Practice,News Work Routines,,,,Paper,Privacy Reconsidered: A Conceptual Redefinition in the Context of Journalism Practice,News Work Routines,"At its most basic level, privacy is understood to be the ability to do things with our lives beyond public scrutiny. Yet the emphasis on the concepts personal dimension that is implicit in the claim of the right to be left alone regularly marginalizes or disregards the critical social reasons we have to respect privacy, which date back to Aristotle. This study seeks to explicate the concept of privacy by recovering the large body of theoretical work on privacy in an effort to transcend the more simplistic claims on the topic in Western society. This study also considers why privacy should be understood as an instrumental, rather than an absolute, value, and seeks to clarify how the social functionalist role of privacy should inform journalistic practice."
2008-1047,Problematic Instant Messaging Use Among University Students,Using User-Driven Technology,,,,Paper,Problematic Instant Messaging Use Among University Students,Using User-Driven Technology,"This study is an empirical investigation of problematic instant messaging use among university students in Singapore. It adapts Caplans (2005) theoretical framework of problematic Internet use (PIU) to the context of problematic instant messaging use by linking pre-existing human dispositions to cognitive-behavioral symptoms and negative outcomes of improper instant messaging use. Four new factors, namely, oral communication apprehension, polychronicity, perceived inconvenience of using offline communication means, and trait procrastination were tested as predictors of problematic instant messaging use. The results provided strong support for Caplans (2005) theoretical framework of PIU and indicated that oral communication apprehension and perceived inconvenience of using offline means were significant predictors of problematic instant messaging use, whereas polychronicity and trait procrastination were not. Lastly, the implications of these findings are discussed."

Using Australian examples, this paper discusses two problems endemic to digital storytelling  scalability and expertise. Scalability has two aspects: the bundling of stories and the propagation of the method of making them. Expertise also has two aspects: the role of the expert facilitator, and the expertise of the user.
Addressing these problems translates digital storytelling from a phenomenon locked into the closed expert paradigm of traditional showbiz to one active in an open innovation network more typical of the hive-like buzz of the internet. It asks how it is possible to bundle myriad self-made stories in such a way that they are accessible to and valued by some larger group, whether that is understood as a community, a public, a market or a network."

In particular, genre conventions that shape those mechanics and narrative themes refract common procedural frames in particular ways, suggesting that procedural rhetorical arguments based on the same general principles can shift depending on the generic lineage of any given text."

This has been especially evident in the power relations of European nations and wider national industries and films of the global South. In the last twenty years, many festivals have also taken more active roles in production through arrangements of co-production and funding, again allowing European festivals to promote films from specific areas, groups or figures of the developing world.
This paper draws on interviews, film analysis and festival structures to explore this important ongoing change, its functions and impact from Rotterdam, Berlin and Locarno to Pusan and Hong Kong. This analysis also allows us to understand the implications of this changing role for global power, within the world of film as well as across other global parameters."

The logic explored in this study features the conceptual linkage between customer-based brand equity and multi-attributes attitude theory. Analysis reveals customer-business relationships are central to a causal model linking evaluation (brand attitudes) and activation/motivations (customer activity). Findings demonstrate that for service businesses (e.g., banks), customer-business relationships are the primary, rather than minor, predictor of brand equity. Implications are offered that apply these findings to public relations scholars and practitioners."
2008-1052,Professional Imagination in Newspaper Newsrooms,News Work Routines,,,,Paper,Professional Imagination in Newspaper Newsrooms,News Work Routines,"Newspapers have been the paradigmatic institutions in which the professional culture of journalism emerged. In a media saturated, digitalized and globalized consumer culture, newspapers face new challenges that also call for a re-evaluation for professional cultures of journalism. Therefore, fresh, empirically grounded, and conceptually innovative research perspectives are needed in order to address the following questions: How are professional cultures of journalism changing, how journalists themselves interpret these changes and what can be learned from these interpretations?
Three objectives designed for this purpose are discussed in this paper. Firstly, it presents a condensed outline of the special legacy and current context of Finnish newspapers. Secondly, it coins a notion of professional imagination as a culturally sensitive research frame which aims to resist two plausible pitfalls of this type of analysis: celebrating current tenets of professional ideology on the one hand and portraying professionalism merely as a tool of legitimating existing media structures on the other. Such a conceptualization is crucial for warranting agency for journalists in times of change. Thirdly, empirical evidence of professional imagination in Finland is provided. This analysis is derived from two sets of qualitative interviews of journalists.
The paper aims to illustrate plausible lessons to be learnt by newspapers and journalism researchers during an era of acute change awareness in the industry in general and among professionals in particular."
2008-1053,"Professionalism, Political Orientation, and Perceived Self-Censorship: A Survey Study of Hong Kong Journalists",High Density Session: Talking to Journalists About Journalism,,,,Paper,"Professionalism, Political Orientation, and Perceived Self-Censorship: A Survey Study of Hong Kong Journalists",High Density Session: Talking to Journalists About Journalism,"This article discusses self-censorship in the Hong Kong media. Besides giving a brief overview of the problematic, this study specifically examines the factors underlying professional journalists perceptions of self-censorship. It is argued that journalists would perceive an action in a specific situation as a self-censorship practice only if they have their own independent judgments of how a journalist should have acted in the situation. The independent judgments are, in turn, based on both journalists sense of professionalism and personal political views. Hence this study posits that Hong Kong journalists perceptions of self-censorship are grounded partly in their professional norms, partly in their own personal political attitudes, and partly in the distance between their own political attitudes and the editorial stances of the news organizations that they work for. Data derived from a representative survey of professional journalists in Hong Kong show that they perceived self-censorship as widespread, were generally liberal in their own political outlook, and perceived themselves as more liberal than the news organizations they were working for. More importantly, the findings support the hypothesized relationships among perceived self-censorship, professional norms, and political attitudes. The results thus suggest that, for the Hong Kong media, both professional norms and journalists largely liberal political outlook are important forces counteracting the pressure to conform to the power center. Other implications of the findings are also discussed."
2008-1054,Professionalization at Two Speeds? Can Government Communication Learn From Electoral Communication?,Exploring Governments' Communication Strategies and Their Implications for Social Impact,,,,Paper,Professionalization at Two Speeds? Can Government Communication Learn From Electoral Communication?,Exploring Governments' Communication Strategies and Their Implications for Social Impact,"Professionalization of political communication in the sense of adapting to the challenges of an unpredictable electorate and a diversifying media system could long be observed in electoral campaigns. This process was speeded up first by the establishment of television as a campaign channel and later by the commercialisation of the media system. In Western Europe, where parties dominate the political system, more and more campaign tasks have over the years been given into the hands of outside marketing and polling experts but are still mostly decided and organised by campaigners who come from inside the parties and thus have a political background, learning on the job in election campaigns.
Although the same conditions apply for day-to-day political communication as for campaigning, the marketing orientation does not seem to take over in the same way as is visible in campaigns. The communication experts, who are in charge of conveying politics to the media and the electorate, are mostly part of the political system and remain in the background. Therefore, professionalization of political communication could be said to proceed at two speeds. When it comes to campaign communication, professionalization has come far and progresses quickly, but the process is more restrained where routine political communication is concerned, because the constraints are more effective where politics is made rather than just represented.
However, as the political system is encountering a more and more disenchanted electorate, the question is whether it could  and should  benefit from adopting the marketing techniques that electoral communication uses so effectively. Against this background, this paper discusses the process of professionalization of political communication and examines whether and what the routine communication of politics can learn from electoral communication."

The ordinances are considered for their structural features and similarities and are analyzed in the frame of Michel Foucaults notion of governmentality, as well as Jurgen Habermass discourse on the public sphere. This study investigates the growth of legalized, regulated street performance in major American cities, noting the domesticating tendencies of ordinances often influenced and/or crafted in large part by commercial, sometimes competing voices from the marketplace. Finally, a core genealogy of related ordinances is considered with the help of one of the principal authors of the original Cambridge ordinance."
2008-1056,Project-ing Action: Caught in a Dance of Agency,Organizational Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,Project-ing Action: Caught in a Dance of Agency,Organizational Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"Following Chia and Holts (2006) building and dwelling analysis I propose in this paper a third perspective for understanding action, what I call the project-ing perspective. IN distinguishing itself from the traditional views of action, this perspective argues for an extension of the notion of agency to include other actors as objects, texts, machines, technologies, architectures. It presents, then, a new starting point to try to solve the action-plan (or plan-action) equation by redefining action as a hybrid association between humans and non-humans (Latour, 1994b, 2005). Furthermore, in this view plans are not limited to a mechanism to, or a resource for action; they are considered fullfledged actors.
In this sense, plans  as actors - can guide/prescribe/control action, but in a same way human actors can adapt/interpret/change plans. To take into account this dance of agency (Pickering, 1995) I draw upon the notion of project as advanced by Latour (2007), which he defines as a particular mode of being of organization that has the capacity to create before and after, under and over, inside and outside, by aligning diverse means. I mobilize this concept in the analysis of project of science and technology diffusion in a Chilean governmental organization. More specifically I study what actors actually do - the project manager, the assistant, the form,  by analyzing their interactions in a coordination meeting."
2008-1057,Promoting Organ and Tissue Donation Using the Two-Step Flow of Communication Model,fluencing Decisions About Organ Donation,,,,Paper,Promoting Organ and Tissue Donation Using the Two-Step Flow of Communication Model,Influencing Decisions About Organ Donation,"Interpersonal communication plays a potentially important role in mass media campaigns designed to promote organ and tissue donation (OTD). Specifically, conversations about the topic of OTD could play a strategic role in increasing the organ donation consent and conversion rates and campaign planners need to consider interpersonal communication about donation as a potential outcome, mediator or moderator of mass mediated messages. Conversations about OTD could serve to both increase the reach of campaign messages and to increase behavioral commitment to donation in the form of registry enrollment or family notification of ones intent to donate. It is further proposed that the attitude-behavior relationship would be strengthened by interpersonal communication about donation by increasing individuals involvement and vested interest in the topic of donation. A model is proposed for future research in health campaigns in OTD and components of the model are considered."

Most high school curricula fall short of providing students with the knowledge and skills needed to tackle the i-safety threats and dangers which one inevitably encounters through regular Internet exposure. Self-efficacy is considered one of the strongest antecedents to protective behavior, especially in situations where performing the behavior requires a certain level of skill or understanding. Using a Protection Motivation Paradigm, an i-Safety self-efficacy intervention, specifically designed and developed to increase self-efficacy and to promote protective behaviors was tested in the present study. Coping appraisals, parental monitoring, previous safe behaviors and issue involvement emerged as significant predictors of intentions to engage in protective behaviors. The i-Safety intervention significantly increased self-efficacy, and offers a foundation for the development of future interactive interventions."

Yet, there is little awareness that we are also the objects of others' gaze, especially in today's global media environment. This paper examines how the coverage of national events by global networks contributes to a new kind of reflexive national awareness, and consequently, a renegotiation of social boundaries and national identities. It draws on a study of the public debates that were provoked by the global channels' coverage of the terror bombings in Madrid (March 2004) and the French riots (October 2005), in Spain and France, respectively. The analysis of these cases provide the basis for discussing the analytical value of 'proper distance' and the importance of extending it beyond a concern with the relationship to the other, to how we are seen and understood by the other, and how this influences our self-understanding."

Why are we focussed with images? Because of the exponential increase of their use in the last decade especially in digital format, it can be explained if we take a look at the proliferation in the use of digital cameras of all types and to their use when sharing documentation via the Internet (images banks, impression, ""on-line"" processing, sale, etc).

To define the parameters of search that a user requests, normally related to objective characteristics, our proposal of work intends to:

 Use a normalized image system for the emotional categorization. For this section, we are employing the coloured images inside the IAPS system (International Affective Picture System, developed by the University of Florida). It is an internationally accepted system within the specific field of psychology, as a dysfunction study system of the user behaviour.
 Study of the metadata models related to the image (""Dublin Core"" or IPTC Headers"") in order to establish guidelines in the description of the semantic content. In our study, we have evaluated a set of descriptors in order to allow working with emotionally referred information, building the metadata shape."

Is it the sense of agency derived from seeing a lot of visitors to the site? Or is it the sense of community derived from looking at comments from visitors to the blog? And does it depend on the type of blog one writes? Findings from a 2 (type of blog) X 2 (comment) X (site visits) full factorial experiment with college-aged women (N = 214) indicate that irrespective of the type of blog one writes, blogging is indeed psychologically empowering to those undertaking it. However, the theoretical mechanisms via which site-visits and comments imbue a sense of influence differ. Furthermore, these indicators of user activity on blogs interact significantly with blog type to predict attitudes towards blogging. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings, study limitations and suggestions for future research are outlined in the end."

In the collaboration mode, two humans competed against two computer characters, whereas, in the opposition mode, one human and one computer character competed against another human and another computer character. Zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi electromyographic (EMG) activity, electroencephalography (EEG), skin conductance level (SCL), and cardiac interbeat intervals were recorded with a mobile system and the participants rated their game experience (Game Experience Questionnaire). The covariation of physiological responses across two human players varied as a function of playing mode. The relationships between different physiological parameters with the dimensions of self-reported game experience are also reported."

reporting and discussing the news events, but also serve to engage and inspire readers.
Allowing readers to post comments, blogs have provided direct evidence to investigate the
public deliberation in the blogosphere. Content analyzed 212 individual Iraq war blog posts
and the associated comment section over a two year period, the current study found blog
posts that were not written by professional journalists, had a somewhat conservative political
view and exposed a lot of emotion are more successful in attracting comments. Also, readers
comments demonstrated a relative heterogonous opinion environment in the war blogosphere."

Historically, critical communication researchers have reviled the administrative influence or applied nature of communication research. While this analysis is often warranted, it has potentially handicapped critical communication researchers from fully developing a critical policy research agenda. As this paper will demonstrate, critical ethnography potentially provides an entrée into the domain of public intellectualism. While critical ethnography invites collaborations that may be construed as administrative in a broad sense, it nevertheless marries historical and dialectical analysis to an active awareness of and engagement in the public sphere."
2008-1065,"Public Interest, Media Diversity, and the Meaning of Media Democracy: Integrated Paradigm of Media Diversity",Media Policy: Diversity and Integration,,,,Paper,"Public Interest, Media Diversity, and the Meaning of Media Democracy: Integrated Paradigm of Media Diversity",Media Policy: Diversity and Integration,"Despite the imperativeness of promoting media diversity, due to conceptual and methodological differences, no practical study has yet been done, which in turn hinders adequate implementation of the policy. Drawing upon this central concern of media diversity, the paper 1) interrogates the raised issues of media diversity within the political economy context, 2) defines the concept of media diversity, examining widely used approaches to the media diversity, and 3) proposes an integrated theoretical paradigm of media diversity relevant to the broadcasting industry, combining holistic and pragmatic approaches. The holistic approach provides a general guideline for establishing public interest standards for media diversity while the pragmatic approach helps assess specific areas of media diversity. In this way, the integrated theory can identify the relationship between normative concerns for the policy objective and specific indicators for the assessment of the multi-levels of the diversity dimension, vital to the explication of the complexity inherently in the concept of media diversity."

Originally conceived solely as research data, these reports also function as social stories and public narratives by women who live and work miles from town. Produced over coffee at a kitchen table, the narratives stand as commentary about identity, rural culture, and farm policy. They are stories framed by silence, isolation, and, paradoxically, deep commitments to community. The panelist discusses relationships developed with the women she has interviewed, interrogating issues of self-disclosure, trust, and the use of a theoretical frame (drawn from the critical work of revisionist western historians Patricia Limerick and Donald Worster) that stands in stark contradiction to the perceptions and identity constructions of her research subjects."

Biotechnology became globally controversial during the watershed years of 1996/97 when gm crops entered the European food markets and Dolly the sheep led to the way to the stem cell debate. These historical events suggest that we need to study the dynamics of public opinion as dependent as well as independent variable. I will end with some reflections on the potential roles of communications research for technological developments: acceptance providers, scouts at the frontiers of science, and angels of history ?"

One method of understanding this influence is through an assessment of multiple levels of analysis. Although communication scholars have called for such analyses, few have heeded that call. This research addresses the relevance of ?context? to the study of media effects on individual cognitions?specifically, perceptions of public opinion. Survey data from the American National Election Studies are combined with a content analysis of campaign news in 29 newspapers in order to parse out contextual media effects. Results showed that perceived public opinion varied significantly across media markets, and newspaper use as well as personal candidate preference had a significant effect on the likelihood of perceiving Kerry to be the state-winning candidate. There was also a marginally significant interaction between media context and candidate preference on perceptions of public opinion."

Analyzing 120 Iraq war blog posts and the 6959 associated comments, the current study illustrates what frames are at work in the blogosphere to support or challenge the Iraq war. In addition to describing the frames, the framing process in blog comments is treated as a strategic contest (Pan and Kosicki, 2003) to reveal how dissenting opinions are contrasted and consensus is formed about the war in the blogosphere."
2008-1070,Public Participation and Agency Discretion in Rule Making at the Federal Communications Commission,"Public Participation, Public Expectations",,,,Paper,Public Participation and Agency Discretion in Rule Making at the Federal Communications Commission,"Public Participation, Public Expectations","With the occasion of massive participation in the media ownership proceedings at the Federal Communications Commission in 2002-2003, many practitioners, policymakers, and scholars have begun to embrace participatory politics in communications policymaking. Against this context, this study uses a Habermasian framework to reassess the legislative and legal frameworks which structure participation and decision making in communications rule making. An analysis of legislative documents and legal precedents illustrate how participatory mechanisms ultimately serve agency discretion. This discretionary power enables the Commission to move beyond public inputs in a proceeding and potentially override the arguments, evidence, or normative claims entered into the rule making record. While participatory democrats argue that agency discretion diminishes the accountability of agency officials to assertions entered into the record by commenters, this paper reconsiders the potential of agency discretion to produce legitimate outcomes. Insofar as members of the public generate, circulate, and make audible opinions on issues pertaining to a rule making proceeding, agency discretion can direct officials towards public-spirited rather than narrowly interested decisions. Such an interdependent process between the rule making setting and the larger public sphere renders the achievement of legitimacy doubly challenging but arguably more profound."

To this end, we investigate the concept of transparency. More specifically, we challenge the strategic role and institutionalization of transparency in the context of contemporary corporate communications programs. By providing a subtle and nuanced view of transparency, the paper explains how a more sophisticated perspective on transparency can contribute to the vision of public relations as an essential driver towards a better society."

In textbooks, this search has taken the form of the defense of two-way symmetric communication; increasingly, in the larger political arena, there has been an attempt to clothe public relations in the Habermasian aura of the public sphere and communicative action. Both moves are problematic because they occlude and mystify relations of power. While scholars have already called attention to the enormous gap between the two-way model and actual social reality of U.S. public relations practice, the misuse of Habermas by some public relations scholars has as yet received scant critical attention. In this essay, I discuss how Habermas may be read in different ways that either help or hinder empirical research on public relations in relation to power. Field theory, from the late French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu and other institutional theorists, is introduced as a more refined empirical model of the public sphere. Bourdieu also suggests a break with Habermass normative assumptions and thus some novel conceptions of what public relations can or should aspire to."
2008-1073,Public Support for Referendums and the Role of the Campaign,Public Opinion,,,,Paper,Public Support for Referendums and the Role of the Campaign,Public Opinion,"Previous research has yielded mixed findings trying to answer the question if the referendum opportunity is either more embraced by those who already are more politically involved or rather by those who feel disaffected with traditional party-based politics. However, it has not yet been demonstrated how a referendum campaign can affect change in approval of referendums and which segments of the electorate are more likely to increase or decrease in support. That is why the current study investigates both the factors that determine support for referendums as well as the role of the campaign and in particular the news media for influencing and changing public approval of referendums in the context of the Dutch 2005 EU Constitution referendum. The research design combines a media content analysis of Dutch national newspapers and television news shows (N= 6,370) with panel survey data (N= 1,561). Our results suggest that those who feel more politically disaffected are more supportive of referendums. Furthermore, we find that higher levels of exposure to the campaign led to increased approval of the use of referendums among those in opposition to the referendum proposal."

Coupling the literature on acculturation, ethnic identity development, and ethnolinguistic orientation, a theoretical framework was developed. Latent profile and transition analyses identified four distinct orientation profiles endorsed by those acculturating adolescents and their developmental trends across four time points. Most Mexican and Mexican American adolescents endorsed bicultural profiles and their developmental trend was characterized by widespread stasis and sporadic non-linear transitions. Further, results of multinominal logistic regression analyses revealed the associations between those profiles and adolescents sociodemographic background. These findings are discussed in regard to previous findings on acculturation, ethnic identity development, and the communicative underpinnings of identities. Limitations of the current study and directions for future research are also noted."

Such cultural factors include patterns of belief regarding the importance of educating daughters as compared to sons, assumptions about the kinds of work felt to be appropriate for women, and expectations regarding the best ways of managing the conflicting commitments of work and family. This paper uses a narrative methodology to identify and explore some of the cultural tensions and competing expectations faced by Chinese American women who are also mothers as they pursue careers in computer science and engineering. Implications for culturally sensitive ways of teaching and mentoring these women will also be discussed."

In May 2004, two months after Martha Stewarts conviction for her involvement in the ImClone stock scandal, and five months before Stewart would report to Alderson Federal Prison, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO) announced changes designed to help the company survive the Stewarts involvement in the scandal, including removing Stewarts presence in Martha Stewart Living. Despite Stewarts much-heralded release from prison (and the public redemption it implied) the MSLO products that emerged post-prison bore little resemblance to those produced before the ImClone scandal began. Instead of fully reweaving Stewarts influence into MSLOs media products, MSLO created the supplementary The Martha Stewart Newsletter. Stewarts private life is the sole focus of the four-page monthly newsletter, which includes photos, stories and tips, and Stewarts daily calendar. This paper examines the companys decision to create the newsletter and the ways in which it functions as overflow to Martha Stewart Living by restoring the content displaced as a result of the ImClone scandal.

These industries, affected by new management strategies, automation, and multilateral trade policies, have ironically adopted many of the features that television scholars have limited in the past to creative industries. The questions I want to raise are: (1) how is manufacturing a site for popular communication, (2) what can television scholars take from manufacturing trends into studying the creative process for television production, and (3) how changes in manufacturing may ultimately affect the creative process in television. Given the roundtable format, I will provide a handout of concrete examples that provide partial answers to the questions I pose and leave it to further discussion and debate.

In the study of media and globalization, despite the careful treatment of such issues as cultural imperialism, asymmetrical interdependence, civil society, postcolonialism, identity, cultural hybridity, representation, and so on, we often lose track of the fact that globalization is not just a phenomenon connected to questions of culture and capital but also defined by weather patterns and climate change, diseases transmission, invasive plant and animal species, wilderness preservation, the pollution and over exploitation of the Earths natural resources, and even the politics of waste. Looking specifically at the underlying but largely unrecognized discourses about the environment elaborated by corporate media and circulated through local mediascapes, this paper presents reasons why and suggestions for how the politics of the Earth can be brought into the conversation about globalization in the field of global communication."

It addresses how members of the video game industry account for the relative lack of GLBT representation in this medium. Previous studies have shown that certain players actively invest in GLBT representation in media (Alwood, 1996; Becker, 2006; Benshoff & Griffin, 2006; Gross, 2001; Montgomery, 1979; Sender, 2004). Factors in GLBT representation include: 1. the presence of motivated producers in the industry, those that are personally, politically or commercially interested in GLBT content; 2. how the audience for a text or medium is constructed; 3. what the public backlash from both the GLBT community and conservative groups will be, as well as industry based reprisals in the form of censorship or ratings; 4. the structure of the industry and how it is funded; and 5. how homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgender identities can be represented in the medium."

While online daters rated their photos as highly accurate, independent judges rated approximately one third of the photographs as not accurate. Female photographs were judged as less accurate than male photographs, and were more likely to be older, to be retouched or taken by a professional photographer, and to contain inconsistencies, including changes in hair style and skin quality. The findings are discussed in terms of the tensions experienced by online daters to (1) enhance their physical attractiveness through deception; and (2) remain truthful in order to avoid being caught lying in subsequent face-to-face meetings. Issues of self-deception and social desirability bias are also discussed."
2008-1081,Quality of Newspaper Reporting on Political Polls: A New Approach,cholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Paper,Quality of Newspaper Reporting on Political Polls: A New Approach,Scholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,"Abstract:
A variety of studies have drawn a fairly clear picture of what journalists do with poll results. This study was undertaken to finally answer the question: What do readers do with poll results? Mainly, this study was designed to investigate the implications of technical details about polls in newspaper poll reports, according to well-accepted guidelines, such as the standards of minimal disclosure of the American Association for Public Opinion research (AAPOR).
The study has two parts: First, using the limited capacity model pioneered by Annie Lang, an experiment was done to research the memorization of information in newspaper poll reports. Second, the recipients were asked to rate poll reports on a series of self-evaluative measures, and to provide personal comments on their perception of the given poll reports.
The results support the hypothesis that the number of AAPOR criteria in newspaper poll reports correlates significantly with the amount of information that is remembered by the readers. Information in poll reports with all eight AAPOR criteria was encoded and stored less successfully than information in poll reports with fewer technical details.
Part 2 of this study provides answers to the question: How do readers evaluate reliability, difficulty, credibility and informativeness of pre-election poll reports? Apparently, readers of poll reports do interpret technical details about polls. However, the results of this study suggest that the average reader is skeptical toward certain technical details, such as the methodology of telephone surveys."

Among the factors contributing to this increase is the preponderance of food marketing on television targeted at children. Previous content analysis studies have identified patterns of food product types that are commonly associated with unhealthy diets, but few have attempted to independently evaluate the nutritional quality of advertised foods. This study identifies the nature and extent of food marketing messages presented during childrens television programs, while also classifying the products advertised using a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services consumer food rating scheme. The findings show that between 2005 and 2007, there have been improvements in the nutritional value of food products marketed during childrens programming. However, there remains a disproportional amount of food advertisements (79%) for unhealthy products. Future researcher is necessary to assess whether the food industry will eventually comply with the Institute of Medicines (2006) policy recommendations for balance in the number of healthy and unhealthy food products marketed to children."
2008-1083,Questioning the Desirability of Proximity,Mediation and Proper Distance,,,,Paper,Questioning the Desirability of Proximity,Mediation and Proper Distance,"Starting from an analysis of Roger Silverstone's book Media and Morality this paper proposes a reflexion on the pragmatics of television in terms of an encounter between two performances: Appearing , in the sense of Hannah Arendt's 'appearing in public'; Monstration, or the practice of conferring visibility. Actual visibility always involves a dialectics of appearing and monstration, but the encounter of these two performances takes different forms depending on the genre of television in which it takes place. The argument of this paper is that either proximity or distance can be desirable or pathologic depending on the genre. In other terms , the genres that propose identifications and the genres that promote debate confer profoundly different ethical meanings on the notion of proximity."

However, to what extent should journalists remain devoted to these norms when the bulk of scientific evidence appears to support one perspective, but different stakeholders nonetheless struggle to have their voices heard? This ?interpretation struggle? helps determine what information reaches media consumers, which news sources are given legitimacy, and how a crisis is resolved in the public arena. The paper examines this question via a case study: the autism-vaccine controversy (AVC), in which ?balanced? coverage was accused of fostering inaccuracies, misrepresenting epidemiological evidence and ultimately causing public confusion. Through a content analysis of U.S. and British newspapers, the paper explores whether ideals of balance and accuracy can be diametrically opposed when the media cover controversial topics. Implications for vaccine communication are discussed."

Yet little attention has been paid to the different ways interviews are routinely employed across various genres or traditions of reporting. Every kind of journalism proceeds by asking questions. But how do reporters turn the answers into something their audiences recognize as news? The present study aims to catalog and characterize differences in the way journalists deploy news interviews (and thus quite literally make the news) on pair of ostensibly similar current affairs broadcasts, the NPR flagship Morning Edition and the BBCs World Report. On the basis of a content analysis of both programs during one week in March, 2007, I find that their respective audiences are exposed to the fundamental act of journalism in quite different ways. Whereas the BBC program employs on-air Q&A as its default news format, the NPR show most often edits interviews into magazine-style narratives; simply put, people tuning in to the American broadcast hear far fewer questions being asked and answered than their counterparts across the Atlantic. The study investigates the differing conceptions of objectivity which correspond to the two broadcast styles, and concludes by suggesting that a renewed focus on the news organization as a source of field-defining practices may best be able to account for the contrasts this research documents."

Ethnic identity is a key moderator for facilitating self categorization at the race level and ingroup favoritism. Growing prevalence of digital virtual humans offers a new venue for comparative analysis of racial processes. Study 1 (N=53) first confirmed the moderating effects of ethnic identity, demonstrating ingroup favoritism among strong ethnic-identity Blacks but not among weak ethnic-identity Blacks. Study 2 (N=64), however, found both strong and weak ethnic identifiers exhibited ingroup favoritism to virtual Black versus White entities. The difference lies in dampened responses to the virtual White entity among weak ethnic identifiers. Prototypicality and ingroup bias are suggested as explanations."

In order to understand the nature of the information individuals received from the press during this period, this paper presents the results of a content analysis of New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today and Times-Picayune coverage of New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. In particular, we analyzed the extent to which poverty and racial characteristics of the victims were a focus of newspaper coverage. We believe frames may be especially consequential when they invoke specific causal arguments. Thus, we also analyzed the causal explanations offered for explaining why individuals failed to leave New Orleans and analyzed who was charged with responsibility for failures of preparation and delays in assisting victims in the aftermath. We compare and contrast this analysis of mainstream newspaper coverage with an analysis of black newspapers. Although the black press was more likely to highlight issues of class, poverty and race these details are present in mainstream news coverage. In focusing on the individual victims in New Orleans, mainstream coverage is just as likely to emphasize individual responsibility as the social or economic factors that might have kept them from leaving the city. In contrast, situational explanations predominate in black press coverage."

2008-1090,"Racist Ideology and Black Characters on Early Radio: The Subsersive ""Marriage"" of Jack Benny and Rochester",Performing Race: From the Radio to the World Wide Web,,,,Paper,"Racist Ideology and Black Characters on Early Radio: The Subsersive ""Marriage"" of Jack Benny and Rochester",Performing Race: From the Radio to the World Wide Web,"This study proposes the theoretical framework of ""Triple Invisibility"" to articulate the state of black character stereotypes during pre-World War II radio as historically treated by the fields of communication, history, and other disciplines. Althusser's theories on ideology and the state are additionally applied to a critical and historical analysis of radio programming in order to reassess the crucial role of Rochester in The Jack Benny Program from 1932-1948. The lack of early communications and radio scholars' attention toward race and ideology has rendered it necessary to revisit the dominant historical perception of Rochester. The combination of biographical research and ideological considerations while conducting historical analyses of radio provides insight into the dominant racist ideology governing programming decisions, audience preferences and consequently the popularity of black character stereotypes. Ultimately, the critical analysis of literature concerning Jack Benny and Eddie Rochester Anderson with emphasis on ideology, historical contextualization, and biographical information is stressed as a useful methodology in studying race and early radio that should be applied in future studies."

This study examines an acclaimed 1947 American radio documentary as an example of utopian journalism aligning with the interests of powerful individuals and institutions. CBSs The Eagles Brood, written by Robert Lewis Shayon, advocated the grassroots-organizing philosophy of Saul Alinsky as a solution to juvenile delinquency. If in that way the documentary aimed at promoting the public interest, CBS also used radio research to promote and gauge interest in the documentary itself. Finally, the program promoted the image of CBS as serving the public interest at a time when the broadcasting industry faced increased regulatory scrutiny. CBS largely abandoned its radio documentaries soon afterward and Shayon was blacklisted. Still, The Eagles Brood provides a historical example of corporate media granting airtime to an alternative journalistic form and presenting an altruistic view of Americans confronting and solving their problems."

It is assumed that individual differences in humans ability to employ these thinking modes, as well as in their favorability towards the use of these modes, are related (a) to the self-reported use of media types, (b) to the self-reported use of television genres and print/online news sections, as well as (c) to the importance assigned to media types and media content characteristics. A paper-and-pencil based questionnaire study with 379 respondents was conducted to test these assumptions. The findings basically support these assumptions; particularly rational favorability was significantly correlated with half of all media use and media importance item."
2008-1093,Rational Media Choice: A Utility Theory Approach to Explaining Online and Offline Political Communication,Online Participation,,,,Paper,Rational Media Choice: A Utility Theory Approach to Explaining Online and Offline Political Communication,Online Participation,"The causes and effects of internet use have been subject to very little empirical research up to now, in large part due to the rapid development of this new communication structure. In addition to increasing amounts of time spent online, new forms of communication continue to emerge. In light of these developments, this paper proposes a theoretical explanation for the intensity of individual political communication, valid for both online and offline political activities. The paper will test a theory of rational choice, in which behavior is explained by the relationship between subjective expected benefits and estimated costs: according to our hypothesis, the more positive this relationship is, the more intensely communication takes place. The internet should have an influence on estimates of the costs of communication. To test this theory, a representative (multiple-wave) survey was conducted in Germany to ascertain indicators of various dimensions of benefit and cost, relative to a range of concrete political communication activities. The results confirm that a rational choice approach is fundamentally well-suited for explaining the intensity of individual political communication. Apart from rational choice explanations, classic factors such as political interest and education level continue to play a major role."

This study examines the availability of communication channels to different sects of an underrepresented population. Specifically, this study exposes the inconsistency of communication channels among Native American Tribes in Oklahoma and assesses the use of the channels for disseminating diabetes awareness, prevention, and treatment messages. Findings of this study imply that health communication campaigns targeting at risk ethnic groups should first identify and assess the ethnic communication channels available to the population, and inclusion of these channels should be essential in the health communication campaign; however, communicators cannot assume equality of access and availability of these channels even within an ethnic population."
2008-1095,Reacting to YouTube Videos: Exploring Differences Among User Groups,Analyzing YouTube: Multidisciplinary Approaches,,,,Paper,Reacting to YouTube Videos: Exploring Differences Among User Groups,Analyzing YouTube: Multidisciplinary Approaches,"In this roundtable presentation I will discuss an exploratory study of how users react to YouTube videos with public interest content and differences among user groups. Our study of 60 YouTube users found that women and men, community members and non-members, and lurkers and posters differed in their reactions to two user-generated online videos with public interest content. The study draws from the work of Stuart Hall, whose 1981 theory of ""encoding and decoding"" argues that although creators of a visual image may have a message in mind when they create or encode it for its viewers, it does not necessarily follow that the viewers will decode the message the way it was intended. Researcher David Morley used Halls theory in a seminal study of the audience of a popular BBC news and current affairs television program on the BBC and found that the interpretation of the television program varied systematically in relation to the socio-cultural background and group identity of the viewers. Similarly, findings of the current study of YouTube videos suggest that analysis and design of online video technology and content should consider the socio-cultural contexts of online video use."

This paper explores the relationship between identity and desire, focusing on representations of GAM in craigslist ads, a site where men seek men for sexual encounters. In particular, it considers GAM as constructed by cultural meanings derived from characteristics set by HIV/AIDS prevention literature. This paper considers why identities matter: from the descriptions created by scholars and the media, to how individuals use them on a daily basis."

Using textual analysis and audience research, this paper examines how in spite of its relishing of a nonsensical, carnivalesque style, television animation has often managed to provide a realistic discussion of politics. When so many other sites for the enunciation of the political have been tainted with the appearance of artifice, manufactured glitz, and calculated dazzle, I poser that realism can be evaluated by the degree to which a program challenges the already prevailing levels of artifice and staged performance elsewhere. Many of todays class of primetime animated television shows have shown a particular zeal for addressing both congressional and lifestyle politics. In the process, they prove the degree to which the comic and the realm of play are prime sites for rational, thoughtful discussion of political realities, fabricating outlandish and patently unreal scenarios in order to lodge very real political commentary.

In Europe, reality television has been found to involve the reproduction of national identity by recreating nationhood in everyday popular culture. What is different in the Arab context however, is a politically polarized context that draws various nation-states in regionalpan-Arabpolitics, played out in a vibrant satellite television industry. In this case, rather than national television institutions reproducing national identity, what is at hand is a transnational television industry staging inter-national struggles. Relying on a wealth of primary sources, including articles from the Arab press, television recordings of Superstar, and interviews with Arab media workers, this paper focuses on the embroilment of Superstarthe Arab version of Pop Idolin the Lebanese-Syrian media war. The analysis shows how efforts to seal a nations imagined boundaries are complicated by transnational communication processes and the entanglement of politics and popular culture, focusing on the difficult role played by women and their bodies in these struggles."

With an emphasis on individual subjectivity, the movement strives to be ?unified in diversity?, to be a collective that respects individual difference. Focusing on the organizing process of the European Social Forum, one of the most important events organized by the movement in Europe, this paper examines the role of email lists and physical meetings in realizing this ?unity in diversity?. The data suggests that while communication on email lists affords divergence, diversity, and the affirmation of individual subjectivity, face-to-face contact enables convergence, unity and the affirmation of the collective. Thus, it is the combination of those two modes of communication that helps the movement to fuse seemingly opposing dynamics."

Computerized tracking systems and charting systems have become widespread fixtures in ERs in an effort to address the problems of excessive traffic in patients by improving the efficiency of care and creating durable and accessible electronic records of patient encounters. In practice, however, the results of using these systems on patient flow and work efficiency are highly variable. Hospital administrators often favor these systems because they serve instrumentally as detailed surveillance systems to observe the real-time performance of doctors and nurses. This paper shows how, far from merely serving as records of medical transactions, these charting and tracking systems are social processes that fundamentally alter the relationships between doctors, patients, nurses and each other."

On the basis of a multidimensional model of the media that divides media culture into the categories of representational fidelity, agonistic public space and media functionality, I intend to analyse the way ethnic and gendered stereotypes are assimilated in daily life through the adoption of preferred, negotiated and oppositional readings. These interpretations of meanings which are circulated by the media point to redefinitions of ethnic and gendered identities as conditioned both by the imagination as well as by economic factors."
2008-1103,Reclaiming Materiality: Explaining Interpretations of Technology and Resistance to Organizational Change,Perspectives on Communication Technology and Organizing,,,,Paper,Reclaiming Materiality: Explaining Interpretations of Technology and Resistance to Organizational Change,Perspectives on Communication Technology and Organizing,"This paper explores the role that the material features of new information technology play in the process of organizing. Although early organizational theories considered materiality as an important determinant of organizational design, recent researchers adopting social constructivist perspectives seem to have lost interest in exploring how the materiality of technology might influence organizational inertia and change. Drawing on an ethnographic study of the implementation of an information technology for pre and post-processing automation in the crashworthiness engineering division of a major automobile company, I show that to explain why a technology fails to bring about desired organizational changes researchers must attend to the ways in which users form interpretations of the new technology not only through their social interactions with other people but also while they are interacting with the material features of the various technologies with which they work. Drawing on these findings, I discuss how misalignments between information generated in social interactions that explains what a technology should do, and information generated in material interactions that describes how well the new technology does that thing, can lead users to reject the new technology meant to drive substantive organizational change. These data suggest that social constructivist research on technology interpretation is useful in highlighting the important part peoples social interactions play in helping them form interpretations about a new technology, and subsequently work in different ways, but that such accounts are insufficient in fully explaining interpretation formation unless they also consider the ways that people qualify those emerging interpretations through their material interactions. Finally I explore how reclaiming the study of materiality in the practice of organizing may help to lead to theory that is more representative of the realities peoples experience in the modern workplace."

This chapter focuses on the construction of cultural and racial diversity in the apparatus of broadcasting using the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN), a multi-nation Canada-wide channel that went on air September 1, 1999, as an illustrative case. After historically placing its history in phases, it reflects on the positive and negative significance of APTN in Canadian society. As a minority Canadian constituency group, aboriginal peoples have more than symbolically gained their broadcasting rights and are rapidly becoming an international model of a new type of transnational public service programming. On the more cynical side, APTN can be considered a channel designated to perform the function of balance within the Canadian broadcasting system by increasing ethno-cultural content and colour on dominantly black and white television."

Media Systems Dependency (MSD) is no exception, and one of its major concepts (dependency) needs to be re-evaluated so that the theory can continue to develop. Dependency is reconceptualized as individuals' dependency to the point of addiction, which is defined as the extent to which individuals exhibit psychophysiological reactions indicative of negative emotion when faced with the prospect of terminating their media use. Imagery generation tasks are employed to gauge psychophysiological responses to imagined media withdrawal. It is expected that individuals who use certain media more heavily, will exhibit increased negative emotional responses as indicated by heart rate, skin conductance, and facial EMG measures."
2008-1106,Reconceptualizing Privacy in Technological Realms: Theoretical Frameworks for Communication,Technology and Privacy,,,,Paper,Reconceptualizing Privacy in Technological Realms: Theoretical Frameworks for Communication,Technology and Privacy,"The ubiquity of technology and networked environments has changed many aspects of communicative processes, including the realms of social interaction, the medium by which humans communicate, the means by which information about people is collected and stored, and the visibility of individuals in social worlds. These changes call into question the conceptualizations and boundaries of what constitutes privacy in todays world. In this essay, I use Craigs (1999) seven meta-theoretical traditions of communication theory as an organizing framework to reconceptualize privacy, grounded in communication theory traditions and assumptions. This yields a framework with seven distinct lenses: privacy as identity; privacy as relational(ity); privacy as cultural; privacy as social; privacy as mediated; privacy as autonomy; and privacy as discursive. These multiple and multi-theoretical approaches allow us to reassess how privacy is conceptualized and provide a framework for new understandings from which to theorize about privacy in the 21st century."

Racial Consciousness vs. Racial Abolition,Dialogues in Black and White,"Although increased scholarly attention is being paid to the concept of whiteness, the meaning of whiteness still remains unsecured in the field of whiteness. Against researchers grappling with the task of defining the concept of whiteness, a foremost assumption encompassed by recent whiteness studies manifests itself invisibility of whiteness as a naturalized operation, and nonessentialism as the fluidity of its identity. With a particular concern for the critique of the concept of whiteness, this paper mainly explores two theoretical underpinnings of race and class analysis, and their discrete positioning of the power operation in the implication of theories. Throughout the analysis, I suggest a closer interrogation of the critical links between racial and class hierarchies that are intersected together and constructed within particular social and historical contexts. I further argue that an individuals accountability, regarding whiteness, should be attributed to ones consciousness of his/her positionality prior to having active involvement in the radical reform of the system responding to social justice. In the end, I conclude by addressing the imminent need of reconstructing whiteness rather than deconstructing whiteness as a means of providing a positive and ethical construction of whiteness."

Together with other buzzwords like interactivity and hypertext, multimedia is one of the most studied online features in journalism studies. However, the concept of multimedia is too ambiguous to analyze contemporary journalism in an adequate manner. In this paper, we discuss the current definitions of multimedia and propose that multimodality, a concept used in linguistics and semiotics, better describes the integrated use of different forms of presentation. We make a distinction between the two concepts and demonstrate the complexity of online news realities where multiple modalities and multiple media are integrated or disintegrated. Based on a multimodal and multimedia analysis of an online news story, we illustrate the differences between modalities and media. We incite to take this difference into account when doing further research on online news."

For this roundtable, I will address my research into the appeal of fake news such as The Daily Show and The Colbert Report. Drawing on a three-year funded qualitative study including interviews, surveys, and analysis of web-based communities, I will engage recent public debates that have (misleadingly) asserted that for college-age students, viewing The Daily Show causes cynicism and is likely to lead to lack of participation in U.S. electoral politics. Do we need to redefine what counts as political online participation? How might we reconceptualize the notion of citizenship and the public sphere within the new media landscape?"
2008-1110,Reducible Complexity and Spontaneous Generation: The Aesthetics of Common Senses Challenges to Evolution in Evangelical Discourse,Partisanship,,,,Paper,Reducible Complexity and Spontaneous Generation: The Aesthetics of Common Senses Challenges to Evolution in Evangelical Discourse,Partisanship,"This essay examines the ways in which Nancy Pearcey, a leading evangelical Christian writer on the theory of intelligent design, formulates challenges to evolutionary theory in terms of common sense arguments which aim to capitalize on the inaccessibility of evolution to an individuals immediate experience of the material world. The essay situates the non-specialist arguments typified by Pearceys essay as the most politically salient in terms of movements to replace evolutionary theory in public school curricula. I identify two strategies, which I call reducible complexity and spontaneous generation, which both operate primarily at the level of aesthetic reception. These representational strategies afford intelligent design arguments the capability to gain purchase over evolutionary arguments not through the presentation of sound scientific evidence, but through their ability to align with the non-specialists common sense experience of reality. The unavoidable complexity of certain scientific theories that challenge our routine experiences of space and time render them particularly susceptible to these types of arguments. Drawing on Kants theory of the sublime as a failure of the imagination to grasp a phenomenon in its totality and the feeling anxiety or displeasure that follows from this, I argue that evolution finds itself on uncertain ground when it is translated for non-specialists. Intelligent design as it is formulated by leading evangelicals, however, does not suffer from an essential incommensurability with the capacities of the imagination, and it is this fact that furnishes it with political exigency."

However, one of the unforeseen negative consequences of downsizings is high attrition by employees who ?survive? the layoffs. Building on a previous study, we performed a secondary analysis of employee survey data from an international consulting firm to examine the effects of multiple variables on the organizational commitment of downsizing survivors using a sample of 2,751 employees. We predicted that customer service orientation (CSO) and equity would moderate the strength of the 2-way interaction between perceived organizational support (POS) and perceived supervisor support (PSS) when predicting organizational commitment among downsizing survivors, such that the impact of CSO or equity would be stronger when POS and PSS were low. These hypotheses were only partially confirmed, as we found that CSO seemed to compensate most when PSS was low and that equity seemed to compensate most when POS was low. Finally, we predicted that increased organizational tenure would be positively related to organizational commitment among downsizing survivors; however, a significant positive bivariate correlation was not found."

Departing from a case study of two prominent Chinese-language newspapers and their working-class female readers in the San Francisco Bay Area, I argue that ethnic media should not be seen as internally homogenous and externally alternative to mainstream media. They should be treated as a complex and changing system of their own, with internal differences in history, ownership, self-identity, production process, distribution pattern, degree of involvement with mainstream media, and so on. Whether and to what extent a particular ethnic outlet has alternative influences should be evaluated against all these factors. As mainstream corporations take over or invest in successful ethnic outlets, as some ethnic outlets themselves adopt a commercial model in face of competition, and as transnational media giants increase their presence in diasporic communities, I argue that the alterity of ethnic media as a whole should be put into relative terms."

Derived from a practical discipline perspective in which the purpose of theory is to inform practical reflection and conduct, GPT builds from interpretive discourse analytic and ethnographic studies of situated communication practices toward a theoretical model or rational reconstruction of those practices at three interrelated levels of analysis: problems, techniques, and normative principles (situated ideals). Tracy (1995, 2005) developed Action-Implicative Discourse Analysis (AIDA) as an elaboration of discourse analysis methodology for GPT. GPT has been applied to various communicative practices including, among others, academic colloquia, public meetings, crisis negotiations, 911 emergency calls, classroom discussions, and alternative organizations. Reflecting on GPT and its applications, this paper will assess the contribution to date, identify problems and limitations, and suggest ways of reconstructing GPT principles and practices in future research."

The present study focuses on the socialization of pharmacy students regarding medication errors. The qualitative interview protocol contained 28 questions on such topics as communication-related medication errors, and training on how to handle medication errors. In-depth interviews were conducted with 44 students enrolled in a 6 year entry-level pharmacy program. Five main themes emerged regarding medication errors and communication.

These five themes were:
(a) pressure to be perfect,
(b) feeling comfortable talking about mistakes,
(c) assuming and communicating responsibility for mistakes,
(d) learning how processes can contribute to errors and their prevention; and,
(e) inadequate & inconsistent training on how to handle medication errors.

Study results indicate pharmacy students experience both incomplete and inconsistent socialization to the role of communication in medication errors and in their prevention."

Examining gossip among Korean-American women in a Midwest town, gossip is shown as a cultural and linguistic practice that reifies moral and social conventions. Ethnographic inquiry reveals that even as people try to impose coherence on interactions, individuals are also able to accept different interpretations of those events, become caught up in maintaining or contesting particular orders, or recognize that not all the contingencies of the events as they happened can be explained. These realities are the politics and power relationships involved in how these women come to share their perspectives, what each member of the community is permitted to know, and how some stories might or might not be incorporated in the collectively constructed interpretation of cultural reality. Given lack of public assistance and concerns for the immigrant community as a proper external support, immigrant womens social bonding plays an important role in establishing a sense of security and cultural identity as well as reiterating moral value. In sum, this research will focus on how Korean-American women in a Midwest town use gossip to collectively build their sense of ethnic and cultural identity and to interpret expectations of their adopted country as well."
2008-1116,"(Re-)Inventing ""Home Affairs"": Feminist Solidarity and the South African Nation",Beauty Ideals and Gendered Frames Around the World,,,,Paper,"(Re-)Inventing ""Home Affairs"": Feminist Solidarity and the South African Nation",Beauty Ideals and Gendered Frames Around the World,"The South African produced television show, Home Affairs, follows nine women who live separate, yet interconnected lives. Although the womens stories are all set within the geo-political boundaries of the South African nation, their varied origins and identities work to foreground the challenge of creating a united and homogenous notion of nation.

The construction of heterogeneous images of women on television within the discourse of nation-building draws attention to issues of equality and empowerment which are fundamental to feminist practice and theory. But the diverse representation of women also exposes ruptures within and between feminism and the project of nationalism as a feminist sensibility is often criticized as a betrayal of the nation. I locate these varied tensions within a feminist conversation and then turn to the historical context of South Africa as a site for the often contesting voices of feminism and postcolonial nationalism as they engage with racial, gendered, and national identities.

I argue that Home Affairs functions allegorically to represent the rebirth or re-building of the nation. As such, the characters and issues of Home Affairs can be read as representative of the larger context of the South African nation. Indeed, the narrative conventions suggest a utopian vision in which all people are united and empowered although this inclusive vision is contingent on embracing the middle-class values of hard work and education. This social and economic discrimination illustrates the competing interests of national solidarity and free market forces that maintain economic, educational, and social segregation."

The research findings revealed that OPR measures can be reliable and valid tools in evaluating public diplomacy practices. At the same time, the study showed that OPR measures can be conducive to predicting expected outcomes of public diplomacy by establishing relationships between foreign publics relational perceptions with a governmental agency, their attitudes toward the agency, their attitudes toward the represented country, and their behavioral intentions toward the country and its citizens. Implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are also discussed."

This study examined how mate value, partner baggage [negative attributes/circumstances partners bring to relationships that may impede relational outcomes], and attachment styles were examined across two data waves to determine their impact on relational commitment and changes in those relationships. Participants were 281 individuals in romantic relationships across 8 weeks. Partner baggage was coded into 10 reliable categories. A high mate value at Time 1 positively correlated with Time 2 commitment, and inversely, initial partner baggage was negatively related to Time 2 commitment. Overall, mate value contributed more to relational change than partner baggage. Hence, partner baggage may be perceived more as a relational ripple rather than a major relational obstacle. For attachment style, mate value predicted commitment over time for secure individuals, while partner baggage was more predictive for nonsecure individuals. Perceptions of commitment at the first data collection predicted relational changes 8 weeks later."
2008-1119,Relationship Quality and Compulsive Internet Use: A Study Among Newlywed Couples,Top Four Papers In Interpersonal Communication,,,,Paper,Relationship Quality and Compulsive Internet Use: A Study Among Newlywed Couples,Top Four Papers In Interpersonal Communication,"Compulsive Internet use has been associated with loneliness, social anxiety and, in some studies, deteriorated social relationships. Almost all conclusions about the relationship effects of compulsive Internet use are based on studies that did not include the relationship partner. In order to better understand the role of compulsive Internet use in social relationships we conducted a study among both partners of 199 newlywed couples. The results show that frequent and compulsive Internet use is associated with several indicators of low relationship quality as reported by both husbands and wives. Both husbands and wives report lower intimacy in their relationship when they use the Internet frequently and compulsively. Several cross partner effects occur. Husbands report less passion in their relationship, an impression that is shared by their partners. Frequent and compulsive Internet use among wives is associated with more loneliness within the relationship among their husbands. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms that underlie the link between compulsive Internet use and relationship quality."

When consumers enter a keyword in a portal, if the search engine displays lots of helpful information, including relevant advertisements, do consumers still respond negatively toward ad clutter? Recently, some reputable portals started sponsored-links services, which provide ads with content that is relevant to the search keyword. However, there is no empirical study to indicate the effects of smart advertisements. Therefore, we investigated whether or not the relevance of the ads moderates the negative effect of ad clutter on consumers attitudes toward ads and websites themselves. All subjects (N=13) were exposed to all four conditions of a factorial within-subjects experiment: ad clutter with relevant ads, ad clutter with irrelevant ads, non-cluttered advertising condition with relevant ads, and non-cluttered condition with irrelevant ads. The results showed significant main effects for both ad clutter and ad relevance as well as interactions of ad clutter and ad relevance on consumers attitudes. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Drawing from the discussion of citizenship, politics and television that took place at MIT in November, this presentation will show that good citizenship is no longer something that is learned or produced by television programs, but that is actively pursued by the TV viewer as she/he navigates the ever-proliferating sites of self work, community involvement and civic volunteerism that television organizes and provides. The extent to which these sites and passages of citizenship formation operate within the logics of neoliberalism and niche marketing, and the way in which citizenship has been constituted and deployed as a branding strategy for the broadcast networks (i.e. American Idol Gives Back, Extreme Makeover Home Edition) will be put on the table as crucial questions for the next wave of television studies.

Using data from computer-mediated group meetings, I describe how self-initiated self repair of minor errors like typos was used by team members as a vehicle for group norm development. The norms for typing style (punctuation, correcting typos and spelling mistakes) vary widely across computer-mediated communication (CMC) contexts. I show how the main function of the repair attempts was not to clarify meaning, but rather to help team members, particularly in their first meeting, work out an agreed-upon set of typing conventions for their subsequent interactions."

Researchers over the years, however, have reached different conclusions pertaining to the effects of puffery claims. An experiment was undertaken to examine the impact of repetition on puffery advertising claims. The results showed that while puffery claims may not affect consumers attitudes and behavioral intentions, they have a strong impact on consumers when the message is repeated. Legal and regulatory implications are also discussed"
2008-1126,Reporting on the Iraq War: How the Evening News Told the Story of the War's Third Year,High Density Session: News Framing Around the Globe,,,,Paper,Reporting on the Iraq War: How the Evening News Told the Story of the War's Third Year,High Density Session: News Framing Around the Globe,"This study used a content analysis to examine the third year of Iraq war coverage by the three evening network newscasts. The study tested the boundaries of enculturation theory, which posits that ones attitude often changes in order to adapt to the environment. Reporters in Iraq, who were often embedded with military units in their reporting (and thus may have been enculturated), had no more positive coverage than their counterparts outside Iraq. Whatever discrepancy may have existed during the invasion, as described by previous studies, was clearly no longer at work. The investigation also uncovered a significant gulf between official topics and sources versus unofficial topics and sources. For example, stories on Congress were reported with significant frequency, received much airtime, and had the highest placement of any story. In contrast, stories on the war protest, or using ordinary Americans as sources, almost never occurred. The study found that coverage of the war was quite negative with positive developments rarely reported. There was no statistically significant difference between the networks in terms of how favorable their coverage was. Finally, the content analysis revealed that while Iraqi civilian deaths and American soldier deaths were the two most frequent topics, they were covered very superficially. In the vast majority of cases, we never learn who the victims or soldiers are or hear from those who knew them. The long-term effect may be to de-personalize such losses."
2008-1127,Representation and Participation of First Nations Women in Online Videos,Performing Race: From the Radio to the World Wide Web,,,,Paper,Representation and Participation of First Nations Women in Online Videos,Performing Race: From the Radio to the World Wide Web,"The representation and participation of First Nations women in online videos is the focus for this research paper. Online videos are videos available for viewing on the internet. First Nations is a term commonly used in Canada when referring to Indigenous peoples of this land who are not Inuit or Métis.

Mainstream media without input from First Nations people contains very limited or one-sided information with many inaccuracies or misrepresentations. As a means of creating awareness of their realities, First Nations people have produced various types of alternate media such as newspapers, radio, and television. With the increasing availability of information and communication technologies, First Nations people are also increasing their use of these technologies in their communities. One technology they have been using is online videos on the internet.

With the rise in websites for video sharing on the internet and the easy access to resources to create and upload videos on the internet, there is potential for First Nations women to make use of this type of media technology as an alternate public sphere for representing issues they can not normally address through mainstream media.

A critical analysis of the representation and participation of First Nations women in online videos would provide some insight into the ways in which First Nations women are currently using new information and communication technology. It also questions and challenges the underlying mainstream assumptions regarding the representation and stereotypical portrayals of First Nations women. Finally, it explores the potential of online videos by First Nations women to represent themselves and their perspectives as a type of alternate public sphere to promote social change."

It explores the strengths and weaknesses of research strategies applied in the authors preliminary studies and outlines possible future approaches.

The authors, whose investigation spans nine countries, stress the need to contextualize initiatives aimed at promoting audience participation in online media within the historical evolution of journalism as an institution, its transition to a networked digital environment, and the development of alternative definitions involving a more active role for citizens. From a theoretical standpoint, it is crucial to understand the social and cultural context of digitization and networking, which together allow widespread self-publishing.

The authors conducted an initial structural analysis that compared participatory features of media websites across several news production stages, each of which was categorized by its degree of openness to user participation. Reaching consensus on the codebook items and guaranteeing consistency among coders in different countries were significant methodological challenges to a central criterion of cross-cultural research, that of equivalency. From a practical standpoint, the website analysis did enable collection of relevant and comparable data within a common time frame, allowing subsequent replication to track ongoing evolution in this area. However, the approach was inadequate for understanding the factors promoting developments within and among countries. Interviews with online journalists and news managers, along with a look at the political economy of the media companies and the participation culture in the various societies, have brought us closer to addressing this issue."

2008-1131,Researching Contradiction in the Media,Reimagining Structure and Agency,,,,Paper,Researching Contradiction in the Media,Reimagining Structure and Agency,"Media political economy is often accused of ignoring the spaces within which dissenting voices manage to speak in the media and of pursuing a deterministic approach that closes off possibilities for creativity and criticism. This paper seeks to develop an approach that confronts these accusations and builds on the contribution of political economy in order to understand more fully the dynamics of media control. This involves analyzing both the structural and ideological constraints affecting the media as well as the moments in which non-mainstream and challenging perspectives emerge into the limelight. The paper argues that in order to understand phenomena such as critical anti-war coverage in the mainstream press, radical Hollywood films, and innovative network programming, we need to deploy the concept of contradiction: the acknowledgement that the same event or process can have mutually exclusive meanings and possibilities. The paper assesses the contribution made by theorists such as Marx and Lukacs to our ability to work with notions of contradiction and examines the implications of their ideas for the analysis of contemporary media events."

An online survey and interviews were used to study the adoption of UGC and to investigate the debates taking place in newsrooms over the publication of user media. Findings reveal that news executives are providing opportunities for UGC but are experiencing problems with incorporating it into professional journalism structures due to concerns about reputation, trust and legal issues.

The term ""participatory journalism"" itself is ill defined. Terms such as citizen journalism, participatory journalism or user-generated content are often used interchangeably when referring to the emergence of online tools that allow for broad participation in the creation and dissemination of content by individuals via the Internet. This study also found that there are inconsistencies in the terms used to describe UGC formats, despite an attempt to develop taxonomy of generic formats.

Semi-structured interviews were used to investigate attitudes among senior online news executives to UGC. The participants were selected as representatives of a particular position in the social system in question, and the number (11) exceeded the quantity sufficient for qualitative research based on in-depth interviews. However, research into emerging forms of media can only explore meanings, uses and impacts of early adopters, in this case senior online news executives at the UK's most popular newspaper websites. Consequently, this raises questions over how representative this group is compared with the news industry as a whole."

The term Boys Love (BL) originally referred to a popular manga[1] genre imported from Japan, featuring the love or sex story between beautiful boys, and is created and consumed by females, especially young girls. By exploring China's largest BL fan community online, scrutinizing fan fictions, and interviewing with the fans, the research should contribute to a better understanding on why this seemingly male homosexuality genre attracts so many young girls, and the changing discourse of gender and sexuality in contemporary China youth culture in the process of globalization."

Resisting the implications of questions or challenging assumptions that have been built into them have been extensively studied in political and media interviews, but little work has been done in research interviews. For data we draw upon three sets of interviews: (a) elected officials about conduct in school board meetings, (b) AIDS patients using acupuncture and massage, and (c) police officers involved in citizen academies. By using each interview site as a comparison for the others, we describe what makes for situationally-sensitive issues and what strategies are used by interviewees. The paper will conclude with methodological implications for the design and analysis of interview data."

Building on research on the role of resources in coping with highly demanding organizational processes and the work of Schneider on public service delivery we hypothesize that several service climate factors enhance employees? affective commitment to change. These hypotheses were tested in a quantitative study in a Dutch municipality. Analysis showed management practices and employee participation to be significantly related to affective commitment to change. Main implication is that when employees? commitment to change is needed, management practices and employee participation are the most important factors for success. Future research should focus on the complex relationships between citizens, management, and civil servants in change processes."

In some studies Pragmatic Value has been linked directly to purchase intention, while in other studies it has operated only indirectly via the attitude change path predicted by conventional advertising hierarchy of effects theory. In this paper a number of possible confounding variables that may have produced these different conclusions are identified and included in an overall theoretical structural model which includes both direct and indirect paths of influence of Pragmatic Value on purchase intention. This model provides the critical tests to resolve the discrepant findings. Results of a Web experiment with 119 subjects indicated that the conventional hierarchy of effects that operates via attitudes held only for subjects who considered the product advertised on the site to be uninvolving. In a group of high involvement subjects, Pragmatic Value influenced the ultimate purchase intention by both a direct path and by an indirect path operating through the conventional attitudinal hierarchy variables. The results indicate a need to extend the conventional advertising hierarchy of effects to include Pragmatic Value when analyzing Web sites that serve as extended advertisements."

Participants (155 married and dating partners) described situations and responded to questions. Analytic inductive procedures were used to identify nine jealousy situation categories. Comparisons indicate the categories of presence of attractive romantic alternative and choice of time/attention to non-romantic other situations are most common among dating partners, while choice of time/attention to non-romantic other and never experienced jealousy are most common among married couples. Married vs. dating partners did not differ in general levels of uncertainty but differed in levels of partner uncertainty following jealous situations. Jealousy situations did not differ on communicative responses, but differed in production of partner and relational uncertainty, relationship satisfaction, and the impact of situations on other aspects of ones life."

In many cases, these requirements are aimed at improving performance or bringing organizational practices in line with governmental laws and regulations. However, such requirements often restrict the decision freedom of organizational members since they are required to alter their behavior. This can lead to psychological reactance and resistance, which can undercut support for the requirements and may put the organization in peril of being in noncompliance with external mandates. The goal of this research is to examine how organizations can mitigate against the negative consequences arising from new behavioral requirements. Specifically, it aims to investigate how information about restrictive organizational policies are processed by organizational subordinates."

It aims at creating insights into the challenges of global social responsibility to consumers and organisations respectively and addresses the question of how such challenges can be handled. Drawing on a theoretical framework composed of relevant theories relating to the experience economy, globalisation, corporate social responsibility and branding, the paper analyses a recent donation campaign (RED) launched for the benefit of HIV/AIDS infected Africans. The methodological approach is based on hermeneutics and textual analysis including visual semiotics and discourse analysis. The analysis of (RED) demonstrates how the campaign succeeds in setting up an altruistic business model between companies and consumers who are invited to interact and stage themselves as both good Samaritans and first world consumers."
2008-1140,Rethinking Cultural Proximity: Multiple Television Flows for Multilayered Cultural Identities,"Media Globalization, Hybridity, and Culture",,,,Paper,Rethinking Cultural Proximity: Multiple Television Flows for Multilayered Cultural Identities,"Media Globalization, Hybridity, and Culture","Television is increasingly produced, programmed/distributed, and watched at multiple spatial or cultural geographic levels around the world, as the television production and flow data in this paper tend to show. This reveals changes in the power structures of television. It also shows emerging tendencies in programmers perceptions of what people want to watch, particularly since the range and level of choice of what is available is expanding rapidly in many places.
Examination of these trends allows us to make some theoretical reflections upon the concept of cultural proximity (Straubhaar 1991), which has predicted that television audiences will tend to prefer their own local or national cultures on television, or for genres not produced locally, turning to similar cultural producers, linked by geography, language or culture. Havens makes an observation important to this paper, that what we see in cultural proximity in television flow studies is not necessarily a clear reflection of audiences direct preference, but rather what programmers think audiences want (Havens 2006). This paper finds that the prediction of cultural proximity is still true to large degree, particularly concerning national programming and preferences, but it has to be made part of an increasingly complex field of television in which audiences pick among increasingly multiple television options based on their own increasingly multilayered senses of cultural identity."

Nevertheless, no large-scale study exploring if, when and how young people go online for religious purposes has been carried out. This paper will present findings from the first online survey conducted in April 2007 on the largest Swedish social networking site for teens, LunarStorm. The study can complement and nuance previous research in several ways. This concerns, firstly, hypotheses about the significance of the Internet in comparison with other areas where young people come into contact with religion in everyday life. Secondly, the study can contribute to a more thorough analysis of variations in uses of the Internet for religious purposes among young people with different religious background. Finally, it opens up for a critical discussion of why young people use the Internet for religious purposes, and where future research might be directed. In discussing these issues, this paper contributes to a further discussion about how the Internet augments the mediatization of religion in late modern society."

In particular, it is argued that the intersection of new ways of thinking about communications media as creative industries, combined with the rise of the global knowledge economy, require a rethink of some key assumptions about the nature of global media in the 21st century. In particular, they point towards a more matrix-like structure of media production centres and emergent media capitals than was the case with 20th century models of global media, which tended towards the centre-periphery model, with flows between a small number of metropolitan centres and the rest of the world dominating global media production and distribution, replicating on an international scale the unequal power relations between producers and consumers in models of mass communications."

Much recent attention has focused on that concentrated sovereignty that drives the enactment and complicity in the United States? ?Global War on Terror,? but a more pervasive and perhaps widespread reemergence of sovereign power has been recognized at the level of biopolitics. Within the space of Giorgio Agamben?s homo sacer?or bare life brought into indistinguishable coexistence within political life?it seems that the study of sovereign and subject might have collapsed into one another within the radically evolving techniques of biopolitics. What does the new biopolitical citizen look like in contradistinction to the Agambenian paradigms? How might Agamben?s legal theory be made to function more specifically and critically within contextual biopolitical governmentality? And what exactly are the implications of this move for progressive, practical cultural study? This paper rethinks Agamben?s categories in part through a critical discursive analysis of the popular, claimed bodies of the actor Michael J. Fox and notorious patient Terri Schiavo. These bodies are produced through a dialectical relationship between the rationalities of excess and capacity. These rationalities, I will argue, are ways of excluding life from the present and relegating it to the potentiality of the past and future. Excess and capacity are useful terms for our purposes precisely because they engage with biopolitical materiality in the very vein of the ?irreducible indistinction? of bare life."

The study draws from literature on interpersonal networks of relationships and from the organizational-public relationship model proposed by Hon & Grunig (1999). Three constructs from the network of relationship inventories, nurturance, instrumental aid, and conflict, along with four outcomes of the organization-public relationship, trust, control mutuality, commitment and satisfaction are tested for their impact on the relationship between religious organizations and their significant publics. Results for this organization type are compared with university-affiliated organization-public relationships. Findings indicate that university-affiliated organizations are rated higher in trust, control mutuality and satisfaction than religious organizations. There was no significant difference for other factors. The relationship between the factors is explored finding that three factors -- responsiveness, trust and conflict  interact differently in the religious organization than in the university-affiliated organization. In addition to introducing new constructs to the literature on organization-public relationships, this paper tests, for the first time, the comparison of two organization types, providing insight into how constructs hold up across types when rated by the same individual."

A total of 207 questionnaires from a representative sample of high school teachers revealed that communication in the form of information seeking plays an important role in planning for retirement, however, mixed findings suggests that such role is mediated by other factors. As expected, a relationship between retirement uncertainty, information seeking, and self-efficacy exists. However, based on the results of this study, the role of social-psychological processes on retirement outcomes remains unclear."

The study identifies three recent pharmaceutical advertisements that illustrate the new edge of target marketing antidepressants to a range of females, with the intent of encouraging them to self-manage their distresses, consume medication. Following work by Donna Haraway and Anne Balsamo the paper considers the images presented of coherent modernist women, absent women (in cartoon form) and a cyborg who is unclearly marked as ill or recovered. The paper reviews recent work, following the materialist turn in cyborg theory of the late 20th century, suggesting a cultural logic for this sudden introduction of a cyborg in pharma-marketing. The author contends that the conflicted visual message, ironically matches the tension-laded script of depression, positing both a complex mind-body system and simple single-bullet solution, and might in fact present opportunities for consumer critique of messy antidepressant logic."

Historically, many researchers have measured conversation about health campaign messages by asking a simple yes/no question. This measurement approach fails to capture other important interpersonal communication variables such as frequency and valence. The revised-item conversation measure includes frequency, modality, valence, and content. Results of a preliminary study indicate that the revised-item measure provides more in-depth information about conversations about health messages held in the week after exposure to two HIV/AIDS public service announcements."

Revisiting Media in Conflict: In Search of Peacebuilding Media

Most studies that explore the relationship between wars and media focus on the role of propaganda for war promotion. The frequent hypothesis in the literature claims considerable impact of media on the promotion of war. Assuming media have played an important role in inciting violence, it seems logical to examine the prospects for the reverse perspective  medias contribution to violence cessation or conflict resolution. Therefore, this study attempts to document the efforts of positive engagement of mass media (peacebuilding media) in peace processes. This study documents media projects from 18 countries, 13 conflict sites and generates a total of about forty peacebuilding media efforts."

Specifically, the analysis addresses the extent to which individuals say they visit websites and blogs with which they agree and disagree. The findings indicate strong support for the detection of selective exposure in this context. Reliance on political websites and blogs as well as partisanship emerged as predictors of selective exposure for political information after controlling for demographic and political factors."

Results provided support for the general hypotheses, but the pattern of results was largely opposite to expectations. Comparative information led to a general suppression of motivation in Study 1, while in Study 2 this information stimulated performance among those received low reward feedback, and slightly suppressed performance among those who received high reward feedback."
2008-1151,Riding the Hits Wave: Informational Cascade in Viewership of Online Videos,"Flowing Information, Cascading Viewership",,,,Paper,Riding the Hits Wave: Informational Cascade in Viewership of Online Videos,"Flowing Information, Cascading Viewership","The exploding spread of online peer-posted videos such as YouTube is phenomenal. The sharing and viewing of such web content are hypothesized to be influenced by the process of informational cascade, that commonly characterizes the choices of consumption by sequential patrons among (content) products of quality uncertainty. We scheme an empirical model to test the informational cascade effect on the accumulation of views or hits by videos. An entire set of 1,304 videos, uploaded to Internet Archives moving images section, during a 4-week period, is tracked for video-individual daily hit captures over 33 days since launch. The views distribution is vastly skewed across the videos observed. The estimation reveals that the larger cumulative viewership a video has gained at a given time, the more views it will attract next. Further, this cascading effect for videos with thumbnails (i.e., a series of pictorial preview snapshots of the video) available aside is significantly lessened vis-à-vis that for those without. This finding espouses the postulation that the rise of information about quality and thus information cascade responds to the role of quality uncertainty. The presence of textual descriptions of videos marginally intensifies the cascading effect."
2008-1152,"Right Behind ""Left Behind"": The Conservative Geopolitics of Christian Apocalyptic Entertainment",Partisanship,,,,Paper,"Right Behind ""Left Behind"": The Conservative Geopolitics of Christian Apocalyptic Entertainment",Partisanship,"In recent years, led by the popularity of the Left Behind novels and films, Christian apocalyptic entertainment has become a dominant cultural force. The messages and themes concerning war, diplomacy, and global relations that are found within the Left Behind thrillers suggest the influence this series may have on its readers. Despite the popularity and growth of the Left Behind franchise over the past decade, such possible influences on the political thought of its fans have not been examined by communication researchers. Through both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, this study examines the geopolitical influence of Left Behind and how the series is interpreted and used. We demonstrate that Left Behind offers conservative, hawkish and unilateral ideology as raw interpretive material and exerts politically deterministic sway, suggesting that the franchise represents a major entertainment media phenomenon."

Companies need to communicate proactively with the community in order to generate confidence, collaboration and commitment with the population of its immediate environment.
In this paper, a specific methodology was defined allowing the corporate websites of the chemical industry to be studied, analysing how the trade associations and companies present at the chemical industry of Tarragona (Spain) organise information and/or encourage dialogue with their community on issues relating to the chemical risk and their environmental, health and safety (EHS) performance.
The results suggest that the chemical industry is not communicating properly with its local community. It is observed a tendency to globalise the information, leading to a loss of local perspective. There is abundant information about the chemical industrys corporate commitments and its involvement in caring for the EHS, but they dedicate minimal space (or none) to explain potential risk related issues. The chemical industry in Tarragona uses the corporate websites mainly to disseminate information about its EHS commitments and performance, but they do not encourage dialogical relationships with the community through the Internet."

Power and Deception in the Workplace,Organizational Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,Risky Business or Managed Event? Power and Deception in the Workplace,Organizational Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"If deception in the workplace is like other everyday social interactions, it is a fact of life. The workplace, however, poses unique challenges for liars, especially for deception between supervisors and subordinates. To that end, the current study examined deception in the workplace between superiors and subordinates to explore how deception occurs in the workplace and the relationship between power and deception. Participants (N = 214), recruited from organizations and universities throughout a Western state in the United States, reported their perceptions of power in their manager-subordinate relationships, perceptions of deception, and perceptions of the risk involved with a recent lie they told to a superior or subordinate. Additionally, supervisors were asked to provide detailed information about a recent lie they told to a subordinate, and subordinates did the same for a recent lie told to a manager. Results indicated that the perceived power difference between supervisors and subordinates was substantial, power impacted perceptions of deception in the workplace and how deceptive messages were crafted, and very few of the reported lies were detected."
2008-1155,Risky Business? Understanding The Barriers to Work in Creative Industries,Theorizing Labor in the New Cultural Economy,,,,Paper,Risky Business? Understanding The Barriers to Work in Creative Industries,Theorizing Labor in the New Cultural Economy,"How does the ability to bear risk determine who can participate in cultural industries? How do the years of often unpaid or underpaid work (required for entry into most cultural industries) serve as a barrier for people of color, from lower socio-economic status families, or with familial obligations? In this paper, I draw on ten years of deep ethnographic research among the first-wave of internet content producers in New York City to examine what I call venture labor, or employees entrepreneurial behavior, in cultural industries. Venture labor stems from the lack of job security and the increase in employment flexibility in post-industrial work and is particularly pervasive in cultural industries with long-standing expectations of unpaid work and training as the de facto requirements for entry into paid employment. Using interview data, I show how respondents explicitly link taking creative risks (such as making innovative, cutting-edge creative products) with a lack of job security and creative autonomy with economic free agency. These findings have serious implications for understanding who chooses to work in cultural industries and why. More importantly, they suggest that economic industrial structures are responsible in part for the lack of diversity of voices in cultural industries."

This paper reports an analysis of the amount, nature and range of empirical research concerning childrens online experiences across 18 European countries. Research teams in each country have collaborated, as part of the EU Kids Online network, to identify, code and compare studies. In all, 235 studies were identified and coded in a publicly accessible data repository. All countries had some available evidence regarding childrens online risky experiences, with strengths mainly in relation to research on access and use; several countries were found to have a richer evidence base encompassing research on online learning, literacy, participation, parental mediation, and so forth. Regarding risks, more research focused on potentially harmful content than on risky forms of contact. Key research gaps included research on younger children, on mobile online platforms, and on certain types of online risk. The paper concludes by observing the challenges facing researchers in this field, including the time-sensitivity of research that quickly dates, the difficulty of tailoring research to meet the needs of a demanding policy agenda, the complexity of designing projects that recognise the contextual and contingent factors that mediate childrens online activities, and the ethical considerations that apply when asking children about private, transgressive or upsetting experiences."
2008-1157,Risky Sex on Entertainment Television: Comparing Audience Responses to Different Types of Negative Consequence Portrayals,x and the Media,,,,Paper,Risky Sex on Entertainment Television: Comparing Audience Responses to Different Types of Negative Consequence Portrayals,Sex and the Media,"This study employed an experimental design to test the effects of exposure to televised portrayals of differing types of negative consequences of casual sex on emerging adults sexual beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Emerging adults were randomly assigned to one of three viewing conditions: a program that portrayed negative emotional/social consequences of casual sex; a negative physical consequence of casual sex; or a program without sexual content. Five outcome variables were examined: negative outcome expectancies of risky sex, attitudes toward casual sex, attitudes toward condoms, behavioral intentions to avoid casual sex, and behavioral intentions to use condoms. Driven by social cognitive theory, hypotheses address expected differences among the three conditions on these five outcome variables.
Hypotheses about the expected effects of negative consequence portrayals were not confirmed. Results indicate that exposure to negative consequences of casual sex does not uniformly influence emerging adults. Rather, the relationship between exposure and subsequent effects was found to be moderated by their sexual risk experience. Participants who had extensive risk experience were not influenced by the stimuli. However, effects of exposure to the negative consequence conditions were identified among participants with little to moderate amounts of sexual risk experience. Both the negative physical and emotional/social consequence conditions led these participants to report safer sex outcomes. Findings imply that portrayals of both negative emotional/social and negative physical consequences of casual sex on television have the potential to positively influence the sexual attitudes and intentions of young people who do not have substantial sexual risk experience."
2008-1158,Ritualization and mediatization in religion and commercial entertainment,Media Cultures and the Mediatization of Religion,,,,Paper,Ritualization and mediatization in religion and commercial entertainment,Media Cultures and the Mediatization of Religion,"Religious ritual is always already a mediatization, a shaping of experience via the forms and formats of media of communication. We should not think print, radio, television, and the Internet so different from speech, gesture, posture, clothing, architecture, music, icon, image, and decoration. Returning to classic sources for the analysis of religious ritual as expressed in such media, illuminates a general model of communication as always ritualizable  as in Durkheims analysis of the origins of totemic emblems, for example. We can then turn this panel discussion of the mediatization of religion to the apparently opposite purpose of the analysis of the ritualization of media, though of course I am arguing that they are two sides of the same coin. The paper will close with examples drawn from the apparently very different topic of the history of radio formats, showing how they became self-organizing, self-referencing systems that created the conditions of their own success, analogous to Roy Rappaports analysis of religious ritual: which transforms the dubious, the arbitrary, and the conventional into the correct, the necessary, and the natural."
2008-1159,Rituals in Dating Relationships: The Development and Validation of a Measure,"Love, Rituals, Commitment, and Conversations",,,,Paper,Rituals in Dating Relationships: The Development and Validation of a Measure,"Love, Rituals, Commitment, and Conversations","Rituals have been widely studied in interpersonal communication research, but an instrument measuring ritual strength and use in relationships does not exist. The purpose of this investigation was to create and validate a measure of rituals in dating relationships. Five hundred and ninety college students responded to 50 items that measured five sets of rituals pertaining to daily routines, idiosyncratic behaviors, communication, intimacy, and couple time. In addition, they completed a relational quality measure, which included six subscales: satisfaction, commitment, intimacy, trust, passion, and love. Multiple analyses supported a three-factor model of dating rituals: couple time, daily routines, and intimacy. These three dimensions are unrelated to the six dimensions of relational quality, but the two measures show an overall relationship, which demonstrates both divergent and convergent validity."

The study and nurture of CSR from a social organization theory perspective examines individual responsibilities from an opposite angle to that of the profit-utilitarianism role of generating wealth. This other approach is the one we follow to explain how the unwillingness or incapability to embrace off-line CSR, is largely due to a lack of transparency in information and corresponding communication between companies and their stakeholders. This situation generates an absence of uniformed and consistent corporate on-line messages. In order to discover this presumption our study is based on the static BIWAM (Brand Identity Web Analysis Method) model evolving into a dynamic RIWAM (Responsible Identity Web Analysis Method) model. We start by focusing on on-line mission, commitment and credibility of discourse (website order or uniformity), issuing from the content production of social and corporate values. To obtain empirical proof we undertake a qualitative analysis of the content of the official websites (as units of analysis) attached to the companies with the highest reputation score in Spains CSR classifications during the year 2006."

The racial identity of the resident advisor did not appear to matter. Participants with stronger ethnic identity made more internal attributions about the different race roommate. In the second study, participants from the Southeast indicated that they would seek help from a mediator for most conflicts regardless of roommate race. Many participants indicated they would prefer to avoid conflict if at all possible. They used significantly more internal attribution for roommates of both races compared to participants in the Midwest. The data from the second study showed differences between Euro-Americans and African-Americans. When roommates were a different race, Euro-Americans tended to seek outside mediation. African Americans were less likely to use mediation either for same or different race roommates. Implications of these findings for university mediation services are discussed."

This study relies on Expectancy Violation Theory to examine the impact of using overly casual email messages with instructors. Study one used an experimental method to determine that message quality (casual vs. formal messages) accounted for between 40% and 60% of the variance explained in affect toward the student, student credibility, and message attitude. Message quality also significantly impacted an instructors willingness to comply with a simple request for a face-to-face meeting. Whether the instructor knew the student or not only influenced the affect outcome. Knowing the student accounted for 4.1% of the variance in affect, and female instructors were more willing to comply with requests. Study two further examined these findings using a survey of both instructors and students. Findings suggest that instructors are bothered more by casual email messages. The reasons why theses violations occur can be broken into two factors called the cyberyouth and clueless factors. The two components of email messages that bother instructors more than students are having no author name in the email message and including shortcuts like R U (are you)."
2008-1163,Rules Online: Coordinated Management of Meaning in Chat Rooms,Real Issues in Virtual Groups,,,,Paper,Rules Online: Coordinated Management of Meaning in Chat Rooms,Real Issues in Virtual Groups,"This paper examines the influence of rules on chat room behavior and on users overall satisfaction with their online experiences, applying coordinated management of meaning theory to answer the question: Are online users really happy with the perceived lack of speech rules and boundaries in online chat experiences? ?A controlled experiment was conducted in which two groups of people were observed in an online chat room. One group was given a set of rules for conducting the chat; the other group was given no such structure. Both were given the same broad controversial topicthe war in Iraqto discuss. Pre- and post-experiment questionnaires, as well as textual analysis of the chats themselves, showed that members of the group in the structured environment perceived their experience in the chat room to be much more positive than those in the unstructured environment. The statistical findings presented in this paper show that individuals in the ruled chat were significantly less likely to place great value on freedom of expression, more likely to have a positive attitude regarding the chat topic, and less at ease discussing the topic of the war in Iraq than those in the chat without rules. These findings suggest that, despite the emphasis in scholarship about users perceived celebration of speech freedoms in chat rooms, users do not have better experiences in those chat rooms when rules are present. Thus, unstructured environments may be the key to better coordinated meaning management in online spaces."
2008-1164,Russia and the European Union: Intersubjective (Dis)Connections,The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,,,,Paper,Russia and the European Union: Intersubjective (Dis)Connections,The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,"The paper departs from the existence of the zones of inter-subjective interaction between the EU and Russia, where both parties communicate with each other as partners, and, concomitantly, not only the EU is capable of exerting some influence upon Russia, but Russia too may have her say. This type of communication covers those areas where Russia has achieved some degree of effect having altered the EU policies. We presume that each type of influence has its reverse side, a sort of counter-influence from the part of an alleged object of influence. Each action, therefore, is inter-subjective. It is at this juncture that the current deficiency of the Four Common Spaces scheme could be explained. The structure of EU  Russia relations makes almost inevitable the highly negative and disruptive counter-reaction in most cases. In other words, almost each step made by one party only enforces alienation and mistrust.
In the paper, the EU  Russia inter-subjective communication is explained as a peculiar kind of the exchange of messages. Russia apparently returns to EU  though in a deliberately distorted and even perverse form  the messages that EU previously was disparately trying to dispatch to Russia (see table below):

European messages Russian concepts
Market economy International prices for oil and gas
Common values and human rights Harsh criticism of Estonia and other Baltic States
Common security commitments and the war on terror Demands to extradite Ahmed Zakayev, Boris Berezovskii and other émigrés
Democracy agenda Democratic multipolarity and sovereign democracy concepts

The key questions to discuss further against this background are:
- How Europe differentiates between difference and deviation?
- Does Europe perceive Russia as the other as less self or the other as non-self?
- Is Europe moving towards a model of gated community, or Europe perceives itself as a projector of allegedly universal norms eastward?"

These technologies helped bridge distances through a process of abstraction from so-called natural means of communication and transportation. Reflecting what Lewis Mumford referred to as the quantification of life, utilities such as the elevator exemplify how industrialization and territorial expansion (both horizontally and vertically) reconfigured our experiential relation to our surroundings. This paper explores the elevator as a symbol of progress that simultaneously became a focal point for fears of the risk of technological catastrophe. I argue that the elevator can be seen as a way of fostering connections between individuals in a burgeoning mass society that also reveals the limits of social solidarity in industrialized urban spaces."

National identity is not only embedded in everyday news coverage but also explicit when international news, to which a nation is related either directly or indirectly, is reported. Accordingly, the study assumes higher salience of national identity when the issue becomes a domesticated international news than it is on a national-level. The study conducted content analysis of the US and Korean newspapers and blogs about the Virginia tech shootings. Space and time frames (Chyi & McCombs, 2004) are used to examine longitudinal change of news framing. Along with space and time frames, the study introduces a collective-self frame to examine differences across nations and media. Findings suggested three points: one, there are universalized framing pattern across nations; two, salience of national identity is different between the US and Korea; three, the public tends to frame the issue with broader perspective and amplify a news frame when it is congruent with public sentiment. The study calls for attention to cross-national comparisons and comparisons between media and public framing to discuss the role of collective identity as a framing element."

Hayek has vocally advocated for increased and more complex roles for Latina actors, and as a result started her own production company, which in turn resulted in the making of Frida. To Hayek the increased visibility of Latinos, Mexicanos and Mexico within the terrain of global popular culture is an important cultural intervention and form of social activism. However, engaging in political work through the cultural industries inherently means making decisions that ultimately contribute to the commodification of ethnic and racial groups and practices for the consumption of global audiences. I explore the political consequences of commodifying the life of one of Mexicos most iconic political and artistic figures through global Hollywood."

This article argues governments should switch away from proprietary standards to open standards for documents. Several competing document formats are analyzed from an economic, institutional, social, and technological basis. The resulting analysis finds that governments should focus on adopting the OpenDocument Format. The article next suggests several strategies governments and public interest groups can take to move towards wider adoption of open standards for document formats."
2008-1169,Scheduling Power in the PBS System: Negotiating Localism and Centralization,Reflecting on Public Broadcasting and Community Journalism,,,,Paper,Scheduling Power in the PBS System: Negotiating Localism and Centralization,Reflecting on Public Broadcasting and Community Journalism,"Scholarship from the field of public television in the United States critiques the structure of the system, its lack of centralizing mission, and simultaneously, its tendency toward a network model with power centralized in the national organizations. This debate exists in the public television system itself, among stations and between stations and PBS. Using prime time schedules from 147 PBS member stations for September 2005, a quantitative analysis works to measure programming autonomy as a function of deviation from a national schedule fed by PBS. Results indicate that PBS member stations assume varying degrees of autonomy over their prime time schedules: correlation coefficients from the schedule analysis ranged from -0.025 to 1.0. These results are interpreted through DiMaggio & Powell 's (1983) institutional isomorphism to understand the effects of power relationships among and within organizations."

However, very little is known about the specific impact of movie science. This experiment examines the influence of narrative transportation, role of science within the movie, and gender of the viewer on evaluation of incorrect scientific information in fiction. Results show that incorrect science facts accepted as true after seeing identical segments from movies depend on the gender of the participant and a manipulation of the perceived centrality of science to the plot. Men tended to detect more inaccurate science facts when the men thought the science was central to the plot. Women detected more inaccurate science facts when the women thought the same science elements were peripheral to the plot, which was presented as a relational story. The results may have implications for research on media effects, public understanding of science and gender differences in learning."

In order to investigate the effects of TV news exposure on perceptions in the case of a recent science communication project funded by the National Science Foundation, we employed multilevel modeling to predict beliefs about science. This move allowed us to combine information about TV Designated Market Areas with responses from a national Internet-based survey, and permitted a model that included both market-level and individual-level variables. Results indicate both main effects and interaction effects. Presence of relevant science stories in a TV market, for example, positively predicted subsequent beliefs about the general accessibility of science among audience members in that market, even after controlling for individual-level variables."

San Francisco State University students watched the film Chicago Boricua (2004) in a Latino Studies film class and wrote essays on the representations of Latino masculinity, the Latina body, and how both are used to inform a sense of Puerto Rican cultural pride. Most students in the class are from California and only one is Puerto Rican. While they may have a geographical and cultural distance from some of the themes of the film, their analysis of Chicago Boricua is informed by a desire to see more Latina/o-directed representations of Latinidad after having been exposed to numerous stereotypical images of Latina sexuality in film. Nevertheless, the students reactions to Chicago Boricua emphasize that Latinos are not indiscriminant consumers of Latino-oriented cultural productions."

A frequent motivation for annotating documents using ontologies is to allow
more efficient search. For collections of newspaper articles, it is often difficult to find
specific articles based on keywords or topics alone. This paper describes a system that uses a
formalisation of the content of newspaper articles to answer complex queries. The data for
this system is created using Relational Content Analysis, a method used in Communication
Sciences in which documents are annotated using a rich annotation scheme based on an on-
tology that includes political roles with temporal validity. Using custom inferencing over the
temporal relations and query translation, our system can be used to search for and browse
through newspaper articles and to perform systematic analyses by evaluating queries against
all articles in the corpus. This makes the system useful both for the (Social) Scientist and
for interested laypersons."

One, what is included in the frame? Two, what lies outside of the frame? Three how does the frame affect perception of what's within and what's without? On first consideration, the questions appear simplistic and obvious. However, understanding these aspects of the presentation of visual material to the eye and brain is critical to the study of the complex effects of technology and individual perception on the construction of what humans perceive to be real and what they remember."

There is substantial media attention focused on lifestyle behaviors associated with healthy practices, yet research has not fully explored how individuals engage with media information about lifestyle behaviors. Utilizing data from a RDD general population study of 2489 older adults (ages 40-70), this study assessed the degree healthy-weight, overweight, and obese individuals actively and passively acquired information from media sources about exercise, dieting, and nutrition. Results indicated that 63% reported seeking and 88% reported scanning. Degree of information seeking increased with BMI category (58% healthy, 62% overweight, and 69% obese). Passive information acquisition was stable across BMI categories. Seeking about dieting and exercise (44%) was more common than seeking about fruits and vegetable consumption (34%). Significant differences were also found in the degree of seeking and scanning by individual-level characteristics (sex, age, education, race, ethnicity, dieting behavior)."

An understanding of the roles that public affairs officers have in supporting SEMAs mission of disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery emerged from the data analysis. The public affairs office had two distinct personalities: one while operating under routine conditions, and another under crisis conditions. As a result, this research presents a new model to explain how SEMA public affairs offices shift into disaster mode. Crisis Adaptive Public Information (CAPI) accounts for two distinct operational philosophies and explains the transitional nature of this type of organization as it reacts to a crisis stimulus. This model offers a foundation for further exploration of this vital area of public communication."

Professional readers try to assess the relevance of information in business reports within limited time, because they are involved in many other activities. A negative consequence of selective reading may be a decrease in recall. Advance organizers help to facilitate selective reading and maintain recall. Graphic and verbal advance organizers were manipulated into six versions of a business report, read by 159 experienced professional readers in a between-subjects design. Their reading time was limited to encourage selective reading. The results show that graphic advance organizers facilitate selective reading and maintain recall. Verbal advance organizers introducing a problem enhance recall, and graphic advance organizers moderate the effects of verbal advance organizers on both selective reading and recall."

Variables measured included self-concealment, frequency of sending anonymous messages, perceptions of anonymity when sending anonymous messages, and anonymous use of employee assistance programs. Findings indicate that self-concealment was related to at least one type of anonymous communicative behavior. Varying levels of self-concealment affect perceptions of anonymity when sending anonymous messages at work. Implications and directions for future research are explored."

The styles, the predispositions, and the interpersonal effects of self-disclosure were examined through a survey method (N = 288). No universal factor that influences all the dimensions of self-disclosure was identified. Instead, individuals predispositions were found to predict the behavioral dimensions of self-disclosure. Unlike previous research, the data participants choose to reciprocate self-disclosure in terms of disclosure quality rather than quantity in online groups. Moreover, the intent and amount of self-disclosure were found to contribute to high quality of relationships in online groups. Finally, the results indicate that disclosing highly private information does not necessarily result in committed and satisfied relationships. These results are discussed in terms of media attributes and their influence on the process of risk assessment and the distinction between self-focused and interpersonal focused self-disclosures."

It posits that perceivers judgments about a target rely more heavily on information which the targets themselves cannot manipulate, than on self-descriptions. Two experiments employed mock-up profiles on the Internet site, Facebook, to display self-generated clues, and to display other-generated clues about a Facebook user. The first experiment (N = 115) tested perceptions of extraversion. Although warranting was supported, rival explanations (negativity and additivity) also pertained. The second experiment (N = 125) tested perceptions of physical attractiveness. Friends comments overrode self-comments, supporting warranting theory exclusively. Implications concern boundary-setting research for warranting."
2008-1181,Semantic Association and Weighted Consideration: How Framing Shifts Peoples Information Bases in Opinion Formation,Understanding Personal Cognitions in the Framing Process,,,,Paper,Semantic Association and Weighted Consideration: How Framing Shifts Peoples Information Bases in Opinion Formation,Understanding Personal Cognitions in the Framing Process,"Frames lead people to rely on different considerations when forming an opinion. Nelson and colleagues suggested different weights being attributed to the same underlying considerations. Another interpretation, following Zaller, holds that people retrieve different considerations entirely, shifting their semantic information base. This study investigates how peoples considerations change under the influence of frames. It collects peoples spontaneous associations in an online experiment manipulating the frames issue-context, valence, and closeness. Analyzing the range of supplied thoughts as well as their rated importance, it expects a two-step process. In the first step, the frame partly shifts peoples information base: Aside a stable core of considerations retrieved regardless of the frame, people activate different subsets of their applicable knowledge. In the second step, they attribute more importance to considerations that resonate between the common and the frame-specific information. First tentative results support the expectations."
2008-1182,Sender-Recipient Perspectives of Honest but Hurtful Evaluative Messages in Romantic Relationships,Hurtful Communication and Violence,,,,Paper,Sender-Recipient Perspectives of Honest but Hurtful Evaluative Messages in Romantic Relationships,Hurtful Communication and Violence,"Five hundred and fifteen participants assessed honest but hurtful (HBH) evaluative messages in their current romantic relationships from either the perspective of senders or recipients. Findings indicated a systematic self-serving bias. More participants were able to recall an HBH message in their current romantic relationship as recipients than as senders. Recipients rated the message as more hurtful, less honest, having less enhancement motivation and less honesty motivation, more intentional, and leading to less positive relational ramifications than did message senders. Relational satisfaction was found to moderate the perspective-related difference on perceived intentionality of the message."
2008-1183,Sensation versus Information: The Surprising Role of Beliefs About Local TV News,Who Uses Local News and Why,,,,Paper,Sensation versus Information: The Surprising Role of Beliefs About Local TV News,Who Uses Local News and Why,"Local television news professionals face audience declines and a rapidly changing information environment. Faced with such circumstances, many have suggested that sensational and entertaining fare might offer a way to bolster viewership. Our data from a national survey of local TV news viewers in the United States (n = 2,728) suggests that view might be incomplete. While a variety of beliefs about TV news  including those related to how exciting or entertaining the news is  predict general attitude toward TV news viewing, the most important predictor of such attitude actually was the extent to which a person found programming to be informative. This pattern has important implications for TV news professionals and belies some prominent ideas about the need to chase audiences with dramatic and entertaining fare despite the typical sacrifice of substance that accompanies such a move."

However, modern communication technologies can make social relationships accessible despite distance. Little research has considered the role of long distance relationships in perceived social support. This paper shows that the mere existence of intimate pre-move friendships contributes to perceived social support after the move. We also find that use of mediated communication is important for keeping these relationships active. Yet when pre-move relationships are geographically distant, new geographically proximal relationships become important for feeling secure and supported in the new location after a move."

The analysis of fund raisers? work-life identity negotiations reveals how a majority of fund raisers assume the existence and necessity of work and personal lives as separate entities. However some participants did articulate these elements as a more cohesive and blended singular sense of self. The trends within these articulations can offer further insight into and direction for further study of work-life identity negotiations."

This paper seeks to address this lack of scholarship by analyzing the importance of service-learning partnerships between U.S. universities and those in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), particularly in the scope of enhancing democratic communication between the U.S. and the MENA. It focuses on a multi-year, multi-faceted partnership, funded by a major federal grant from the U.S. Department of State, between students and faculty in a U.S.-based communication program and a press institute in North Africa, along with media practitioners, Arab-American news organizations, and civil society leaders and organizations in the U.S. and the MENA. The paper includes assessment procedures for partnership outcomes and, perhaps most useful to the readership of this volume, several important considerations for creating and sustaining an international partnership."

A total of 9 in-depth interviews from staff and volunteers were conducted, transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory, resulting in a theoretical model describing (a) the causal condition that supports non-profit community newspapers, (b) phenomena that arose from those causal conditions, (c) two influences on the phenomena and (d) the result of the phenomena. Subcategories of each component of the theoretical model were also identified and are illustrated by narrative data. The central phenomena of the study was the identification both the newspapers and their communities reciprocally interact and serve the other, resulting in the communities sense of ownership of the newspapers."
2008-1188,Severed Voice: The Radiophonic Effect of the Eichmann Trial,Communication and the Postwar Experience,,,,Paper,Severed Voice: The Radiophonic Effect of the Eichmann Trial,Communication and the Postwar Experience,"The Eichmann trial, which took place in Jerusalem in 1961, was a transformative event in Holocaust history in Israel. While recent studies have often noted the role of radio during the trialthe only broadcasting medium operating in Israel at the time (television became available only in 1968)none have offered an extensive study of its impact. This paper ventures such an investigation, focusing on the audible register through which the trial came to public consciousness in Israel. If the Eichmann trial brought together the discourse of law and the discourse of trauma, as critics like Shoshana Felman argue, then radio was the technology by which these two speech-oriented practices coalesced. Drawing on popular texts, archival material and personal interviews, we propose that radio facilitated a fundamental shift in the way Holocaust survivors were viewed in Israel. Prior to the trial, survivors were typically seen as eccentric figures, often on the verge of lunacy. We argue that radio broadcasting of trial testimonies occasioned a profound shift: No longer deemed marginal, survivors were now given a public stage to recount their experiences. Thus the radiophonic effect of this trial was in transforming survivors from bodies without speech to speech without bodies. Only as voices severed from corporeality did victims become accusers; only as disembodied speech could they be heard."

A multi-disciplinary theoretical framework is provided to conceptualize the problematic relationship between female consumption practices and the Western beauty ideal. Selected episodes from ""Sex and the City"" are analyzed through the theoretical framework provided to critically examine consumption practices related to the Western beauty ideal for the lead character of the show, Carrie Bradshaw. Finally, the author integrates the textual analysis and the theoretical framework provided to draw attention to the common lessons women are socialized to embrace related to consumption practices surrounding the Western beauty ideal. The discourse between the media industry, the fashion industry and the viewing audience is underscored to highlight how these entities all speak to the prominent role consumption practices surrounding the Western beauty ideal play for women in contemporary American culture."

Our research documented more than eight times as many criminal libel prosecutions in a single state (Wisconsin) than the most comparable previous study had located. We also found that most of the cases did not deal with politics or public issues. Rather, most involved sex, lies, and/or the Internet in one way or another. While many defendants were convicted, just as many used First Amendment arguments to their advantage. An important implication of the paper is that conclusions about the level and content of prosecutions should come from a representative sample of prosecutions rather from the atypical (and often very small) sample of cases that gain the attention of the news media or First Amendment advocacy groups."
2008-1191,"Sex, Science and Religion: Mediating the Kinsey Reports","Changing Social Landscapes: Negotiating Religion, Sex, and Politics in Popular Culture",,,,Paper,"Sex, Science and Religion: Mediating the Kinsey Reports","Changing Social Landscapes: Negotiating Religion, Sex, and Politics in Popular Culture","In 1948 and again in 1953, The Institute of Sex Research, spearheaded by Alfred Kinsey, published two reports that challenged conventional morality around sexuality and sparked major controversy in the media. Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female attacked religious attitudes toward sex and claimed that science would resolve much of the confusion and anxiety that prevailed. Response to these volumes, particularly the volume on women, was explosive and voluminous. This research deconstructs the religious media, principally Christian media, and their refutation of the Kinsey reports. The response from religious media  articles, op-eds, and published sermons  was almost uniformly negative. Critics feared that the moral fabric of America, especially the centrality of the family, was under attack. At stake was whether science or religion would be the determining structure for the definition of American culture and identity, played out on the bodies of women.

The results indicated that the interaction between sexual cognition and advertising stimulus significantly activated personal involvement with the products, while the interaction of sexual fantasy with advertising stimulus only marginally influenced personal involvement. Additionally, sexually oriented advertising did not generate a stronger influence on personal involvement with the advertised products than general advertising. Although sexually oriented advertising strongly motivated males to higher involvement with the advertised products, females were more inclined to higher involvement after their exposure to general advertising. The limitations and implications were also discussed."

This paper analyzes how the China Central Televisions annual gala show has been employed by the Chinese government and cultural elites to shape nation-building discourse packaged in entertainment through a content analysis of 20 years programs from 1984 to 2003. The results show that the gala show constructs nationalism in four dimensions, and there is a significant increase of the nation-building discourse from the 1990s, which may have been triggered by the confrontation between China and the US."

The paper presents preliminary results from an ongoing research project about the Swiss debate on green biotechnology (genetically modified plants in agriculture).

Theory and research questions: 1) Which actors as stakeholders try to influence the media agenda in the public sphere by strategically framing the topic of GM plants? What are the underlying network structures between the leading actors? 2) How do journalists and mass media set the agenda and frame the issue? 3) How are opinions and attitudes of the engaged audience shaped and moulded?

Method: We use a multi methods approach that combines in depth interviews with stakeholders and journalists, content analysis and survey data.

Findings of this project will be instrumental for a critical analysis of the public debate on the background of the principles of deliberative democracy, highlighting contradictions in argumentations and gaps in knowledge."

Major groupings of variables from the film success prediction literature are taken and modified into a model with an outcome of video game quality. Major constructs, such as video game quality, are defined with regard to conceptual and operational considerations. The model is presented with an outcome of quality as opposed to financial success. Major assumptions are stated and the model is diagrammed conceptually. Testable hypotheses are generated from the model that specify relationships between interesting variables, and a discussion of further development including testing relationships and model revision is addressed."

This paper is meant to be an exploration of the complexities and intersections of gendered space in the Arab world and examines the possibility of feminine television space as an iteration of gendered spatial practices in the Middle East. The paper discusses the ways in which the medium of television is gendered, with particular focus on the televisual practices and cultural contexts of television in the Arab/Muslim world that might contribute to these processes. In order to illustrate the premise that television is a manifestly feminine medium, I will examine various articles for their examples of the multiple levels at which women and television interrelate to confer femaleness to television. A sampling of Arab music videos featuring female performers is later used as a demonstrative device based on the particular ability of these cultural texts to inspire debate and anxiety over their content, dissemination, and consumption."

The ""Great Cities Initiative,"" launched by a university in the Chicago media market, was the basis for a naturalistic quasi-experiment. The phrase ""great cities"" in the Chicago Tribune increased from 15 pretest occurrences to 65 during the posttest. Nevertheless, only 17 occurrences were in stories identifying the campaign source. Semantic network diversity increased. Evidence favored semantic priming over framing effects. This indicates that the public relations campaign did not result in as many articles that were consistent with campaign framing as articles that dealt with unrelated aspects of the concept great cities. To examine longer term changes in priming effects, a series of 16-month periods from the primary post-test period forward until February 14, 2007 was analyzed for the number of stories containing great cities. The slope of the line it shows that the initial increase in great cities use during the immediate post-campaign launch period continued to rise through 32 months after the launch, after which the trend is downward. The university continued its communication about the Great Cities Initiative throughout this period and continues to do so."

In-depth interviews of people who self-identify as Sikh in the Central Valley area of California were conducted. Using a historical understanding of Sikhism and theories of identity and symbolic interactionism the author reached two major conclusions. First, there has been a negative impact upon the identity of Sikhs living in the Central Valley of California in the transference of fear and hatred from those who conducted 9/11 to Muslims in general to those who resemble Muslims in symbols and ethnic features, such as the Sikhs. Secondly, the author isolated two mechanisms of response to the negative impacts upon their identity: proactive and reactive. This study, in shedding light on a rarely studied group, identifies an area of study for future quantitative research to formulize the mechanisms of response identified by this study."

A groups potential to outperform individual decision makers is especially apparent if the knowledge of the members of a team or committee is distributed asymmetrically like in hidden-profile tasks. Previous research on hidden profiles indicated that groups have difficulties mastering the challenge of communicating and integrating unique information held by single group members. As a consequence, groups typically failed to detect hidden profiles. We summarize the results of a set of simulation studies and of two experiments, in which we identified conditions that enable groups to detect hidden profiles. We observed that groups can solve this task under the following conditions: (1) Groups enter discussions without preconceived opinions (naïve groups vs. pre-decided groups); and (2) information on the choice alternatives is presented in the form of common cues, which facilitates the application of a cue-based heuristic."
2008-1200,Sins of the Father: Does Scandalous News Undermine Social Trust?,Exploring Media Bias,,,,Paper,Sins of the Father: Does Scandalous News Undermine Social Trust?,Exploring Media Bias,"There has been considerable debate as to whether consuming media, particularly television news, stimulates or diminishes social trust and engagement. This study addresses this debate by examining how viewing a television story depicting the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church affects participants engagement and trust in social leaders and institutions. It hypothesizes that failures by trusted moral exemplars in a society will undermine trust not only in those figures, but also in related, less trustworthy figures throughout society. The results show that the scandalous treatment strongly reduced trust in and support for religious figures and institutions. More importantly, however, the negative effects extended to a wide variety of societal figures and institutions that were in no way implicated in the scandal, including politicians. These results imply that scandalous news, particularly sensational news involving trusted figures, has the potential to diminish social trust and conceivably diminish social capital across surprisingly wide swaths of society."
2008-1201,"Sisters, Cousins, Competitors or Friends? Visual Competence and Media Literacy",Visual Competence: A New Paradigm?,,,,Paper,"Sisters, Cousins, Competitors or Friends? Visual Competence and Media Literacy",Visual Competence: A New Paradigm?,"Because of the rapidly changing nature of our global cultural environment and the role of visual imagery in enhancing personal, social and cultural development, the concept of literacy is now expanding to include digital, visual and electronic media and popular culture. Visual competence has emerged from a European context as a term that connects visual literacy to media production, the psychology and neuroscience of vision, and semiotic analysis. Media literacy has emerged from the fields of media studies and education and is often defined as the ability to access, analyze, evaluate and communicate messages in a wide variety of forms.

Image or visual competence is considered to be a cultural technique with a receptive and productive dimension. It positions inquiry into the meaning-making process of humans construction of and encounter with various forms of visual media. Many social scientific and humanistic disciplines contribute to studies in visual competence, focusing on 1) the psychophysiological processes of vision, 2) the practices of image analysis in a cultural and historical context, and 3) frameworks from aesthetic philosophy and semiotics. It is generally theoretical and transdisciplinary in orientation.

Most scholars and practitioners in media literacy conceptualize it by emphasizing three elements: (1) a personal focus on accessing and using media and technology; (2) the process of critically analyzing and evaluating the content, form and contexts of media messages and media systems and institutions; and (3) the ability to compose or create messages using digital, visual and electronic tools for purposes of self-expression, communication and advocacy. Media literacy is practical in its fundamental orientation and concerned with the development of critical thinking and communication skills.

In this session, I explore the relationship between media literacy and visual competence, looking at the key ideas shared by both and the unique elements of each. The relationship between the two must be examined in the context of the rich interdisciplinary focus of both concepts. Just how close are the two concepts: sisters, cousins, competitors or friends?"
2008-1202,SMS Motives Predicting SMS Use and Attitudes toward SMS Advertising: The Evidence from Thailand,Online Persuasion,,,,Paper,SMS Motives Predicting SMS Use and Attitudes toward SMS Advertising: The Evidence from Thailand,Online Persuasion,"Short Message Service (SMS) is a text-based messaging mobile phone technology that becomes one of the most popular mobile applications among teenagers and business people around the world (Carroll, Barnes, Scornavacca, & Fletcher, 2007; Leung, 2007). Different from other traditional communication channels, SMS messages sent through mobile phone can be easily customized to gratify consumers needs. Through SMS marketing, marketing communicators are able to reach their target customers more precisely and accurately. Thus, understanding consumers needs and motives is essential for communicators, advertisers, and marketers in the customer-focused era to predict customers' behavior better.

The major purposes of this study were: (1) to explore peoples gratification for using SMS, and (2) to investigate predictive relationships among their SMS motives, SMS use, and attitudes toward SMS advertising/marketing promotions. In Study 1, content analysis and factor analysis explored and verified six SMS motives: (1) unavailability of the call receiver, (2) expression of feelings, (3) greetings, (4) economical values, (5) social involvement, and (6) convenience. In Study 2, the findings showed that convenience was a significant positive predictor of SMS use. People who used SMS for convenience sent more messages than those who used SMS for other purposes. Also, high SMS users viewed SMS advertising/marketing promotions in a more positive light and tended more to accept, fond of, and be interested in SMS advertising than did low users."

Evaluating Cross-National Evidence,,,,Paper,Social Accessibility and Instant Messaging: University Students' Negotiation of Public and Private Time,Do ICTs Foster Social Connectivity or Social Isolation? Evaluating Cross-National Evidence,"Little is known about how social accessibility has changed with the proliferation of computer-mediated communication. To fill this void, we investigate the temporal structure of social accessibility, individuals definitions of public and private time, and how social accessibility is negotiated. We use multiple methods to examine Canadian university students' social accessibility in instant messaging (IM): surveys, focus groups, and interviews. The temporal structure of IM social accessibility was related to students schedules and daily activities. The four key characteristics were predictability, downtime, multi-tasking, and online activity. Private and public time blur seamlessly in IM use, with students making themselves available as a function of social relationships and context. Negotiation of social accessibility is complex, and often evolves over the development of relationships. We describe four strategies that help students control their availability in IM."

It also presents the results of the study conducted in 1999 through 2006 aimed at identifying socio-cultural factors and personal attributes that influence activities and communication within the framework of internet-based research communities. Data collection rested on face-to-face and online interviews that served as the study instrument. Study instruments solicited the information on cultural values, social background, culture-based communication styles, etc. The results obtained were integrated into description to gain understanding the difference between traditional and internet-based research community that will be presented in the paper."

Hypotheses predicted that CMC would mitigate the extent to which social anxiety caused ones partner to view one as anxious and that CMC would attenuate the negative association between ones social anxiety and ones partners conversational satisfaction. A sample (N = 206) of undergraduate students were paired in unacquainted dyads and then engaged in initial interaction conversations in either a face-to-face (FtF) or computer mediated communication (CMC) context. The researchers measured social anxiety before the conversation and a number of additional outcomes after the conversation. The results revealed that CMC is a significant contributory condition to the association between social anxiety and ones partners perception of this anxiety and a contributory condition to the association between social anxiety and ones partners conversational satisfaction.

Guided by current health and risk behavior models, four focus groups (n = 45) were conducted to explore why people preparing food for their families and friends do not comply with the recommendations. One unanticipated factor was the role that food preparation plays for cooks as a regular opportunity to think of themselves and present themselves to others as knowledgeable and effective. This had unexpected effects, both positive and negative, on compliance. This factor is not an obvious part of current approaches to compliance in theories of risk and merits further exploration. Modifications for future food safety campaigns, such as incorporating consumer-generated motivations for compliance, are suggested."

Analysis of network properties shows the potential for social capital through access to diverse informants and rapid information flow through the network. However, analysis of properties also supports a proposed model for social control, the polyopticon. The polyopticon adds to previous opticons (panopticon, synopticon) by including simultaneous adherence to multiple sets of rules, coming from multiple groups, which results in highly constrained behavior for the individual."
2008-1208,Social Consequences of Innovative Low-Cost Connectivity in Africa,When the Internet Reaches the Villages,,,,Paper,Social Consequences of Innovative Low-Cost Connectivity in Africa,When the Internet Reaches the Villages,"Access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) remains one of the biggest challenges to Africa in leapfrogging the development chasm. The African digital divide can be in part attributed to a restrictive regulatory policy that entrenches the monopolistic power base of the local Telco. Innovation is a key driver for change and what is needed is a mindset that empowers communities at the local level to embrace technology and create community owned networks enabling and supporting local economic development.
The regulatory environment should support innovation and provide for a bottom up approach to community owned networks. The aim of this paper is to give an interim report on a study of a multi-disciplinary series of projects in Sub-Saharan Africa exploring the technological and social consequences of innovative low-cost telecommunications."
2008-1209,Social Cues in Social Games: Measures of Player Experience as Game Elements,Continuous Measurement of Digital Game Experiences,,,,Paper,Social Cues in Social Games: Measures of Player Experience as Game Elements,Continuous Measurement of Digital Game Experiences,"Poker is a neat example of a social game. Apart from cognitive skills (e.g. evaluating own hands), socio-emotional skills (mind-reading, deception etc.) play a role in poker. Although online-poker lacks certain social cues, indicators for the socio-emotional processes involved, like gaze or arousal, can be measured (e.g. via psychophysiological methods or eye-tracking). In addition, these data can be fed back into the game, thus making the measurement a part of the game while at the same time providing valid measurements of the players experience. Online-poker offers methodological advantages like control over game events, objective performance measures, high involvement, easy recording and a standardized course. Insights from studies with online-poker can also be used to better understand interaction processes in other competitive situations. In an exploratory study we collected data on GSR and PPG, eye-movement, mimics and game events (through log-files and screen captures) to identify relevant social cues."

Participants (N = 256) were assigned to 64 four-person groups and interacted through synchronous computer chat. Distinct sub-group pairings instantiated in-group and out-group identifications. One confederate in each group was instructed to engage in interpersonally likeable or dislikeable behavior. Although the identification manipulation did affect ingroup/outgroup identification, analysis revealed that confederates acting likeably were more attractive than those acting dislikeably regardless of their intergroup membership. Results suggest that interpersonal behavior is a better predictor of relational communication and evaluative process in virtual groups than intergroup dynamics."

How has grassroots experimentation with commercial WiFi technology expanded into a mobilization with social and political goals? This paper proposes an evaluative framework for CWN drawing from constructivist studies of science and technology that examine the articulations created between technology and policy. Drawing from empirical research conducted at meetings of CWN actors between 2004 and 2007, it describes the tensions created between oppositional perspectives of WiFi networks as disruptive networks and as ubiquitous networks. The paper concludes by examining the outcomes of these articulations as they influence policy and social mobilization."
2008-1212,Social Influence on an Organizations Successful Adoption of Instant Messaging,Researching the Virtual Organization,,,,Paper,Social Influence on an Organizations Successful Adoption of Instant Messaging,Researching the Virtual Organization,"Previous research in synchronous computer-mediated chat programs, commonly referred to as Instant Messengers (IMs), has had problems identifying the factors leading to successful adoption of IM in an organization. This study uses the Social Influence Model (Fulk, Schmitz, & Steinfield, 1990) to explore how members of an organization actually initially integrated IMs into their communication habits. Seventeen members of a Midwest school district were interviewed to understand their introduction to and adoption of IM programs as a communication medium. Participants reported adopting IM because of direct statement and vicarious learning from peers, as well as norms for media behaviour and social definitions of rationality. Furthermore, respondents noted that ince introduced, normative influences and reflection on uses of IM demonstrated utility which led to continued medium use. In accordance with the Social Influence Model, organizational members reported strong social influences led them to adopt IM organizational communication."
2008-1213,"Social Internet Use, Trait Loneliness, and Mood Loneliness","Blogs, Chats, E-Mail, and Wikis",,,,Paper,"Social Internet Use, Trait Loneliness, and Mood Loneliness","Blogs, Chats, E-Mail, and Wikis","Previous literature on internet use and psychological well-being mainly adopts correlational analysis, and treats psychological well-being as a package composed of such constructs as loneliness, depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and so forth. These constructs are not carefully examined in terms of their nature, mechanism, causes, consequences, and furthermore, how they are related to communication. The present study focuses on loneliness and social use of the internet, and reviews the studies relevant to this topic from both social psychology and computer-mediated communication literature, as a response to the call for interdisciplinary research from scholars in these two areas. A pilot study was conducted revealing that recalling and writing stories of loneliness experience was a valid way to arouse mood loneliness. Two hundred and thirty four subjects participated in the formal study, composed of a survey testing trait loneliness and a 5-condition (face-to-face chatting, instant messenger chatting, watching video, writing assignments, and do nothing). Mood loneliness increased after people chatted online. People reported higher level of mood loneliness after chatted online than those conversed face to face. For people with high trait loneliness, the mood loneliness increase in computer-mediated communication condition was significantly higher than that in face-to-face communication condition. People gave
more positive evaluation to face-to-face communication than computer-mediated communication. There was negative relationship between evaluation and posttest mood loneliness in social activity conditions, which are face-to-face and computer-mediated communication. Also in these two groups, evaluation to the communication was positively related to how long the communication lasted."
2008-1214,"Socially Imprisoned, Virtually Free: Internet-Based Sites of Support",Researching the Virtual Organization,,,,Paper,"Socially Imprisoned, Virtually Free: Internet-Based Sites of Support",Researching the Virtual Organization,"Abstract
This study investigates the stories of family members of the incarcerated to understand how they use technology to escape the confines of social imprisonment. Three macro themes emerged. Findings indicate that individuals felt socially imprisoned by family, friends and society and subsequently turned to virtually created family and friends to meet needs of support. Further, the technology of the site enabled supportiveness to occur. Implications of this study point to the benefits of online technology as a form of support for the socially stigmatized and suggest the addition of a forth attribute of separation be added to new media interpretations of uses and gratifications theory."

This will be followed by an examination of the legacy of Habemas public sphere and Castells network theory. I will explore how the former excludes peripheral actors from societal dialogue while linking the tenets of the latter to recent movement trends. The analysis will then shift to an examination of the orientation of engaged social movement actors. How are they replicating the hegemonic behaviors within the established societal structures they repudiate? How can conceptual and practical developments inform us of the potential of movement actions within altered spaces? I seek to provide more insight into these developments and related questions in an attempt to better contextualize contemporary social movements.

To date, little has been studied about environmental communication in non-Western cultures. This paper thus attempts to supplement extant environmental communication studies by examining the predictability of the following factors to environmental behavior among 320 adolescents (136 males and 184 females) in Hong Kong: media exposure, social influence, environmental attitude, environmental knowledge, environmental concern and egoistic motive. Media exposure and social influence were found to be the most significant predictors, followed by environmental concern, environmental knowledge and egoistic motive. Practical implications of these results for environmental education and campaigns were conferred at the end of the paper."

The approach, based on work by Norman Fairclough (1992), describes the construction of such controversies in terms of chains of communicative events and particularly attends to processes of intertextuality and interdiscursivity within and between orders of discourse. This framework is situated within extant work in the rhetoric of science and is illustrated through a case study of a controversy surrounding an evolutionary psychology study on gender and spatial cognition."
2008-1218,Some Body on the Radio,Gender and Technology in Contemporary Popular and Experimental Musics,,,,Paper,Some Body on the Radio,Gender and Technology in Contemporary Popular and Experimental Musics,"In the early 1990s, a genealogy for radio art (and by extension, media art) experimentation was established, beginning with the Italian and Russian Futurists and including James Joyce, John Cage, Antonin Artaud, William Burroughs, and a motley assortment of Dadaists and Surrealists. In the context of current new media and transmission art practices, such early avant-garde influences have become canonized, to some degree perpetuating and reinforcing such Futurist notions as media and technology as inherently autonomous and transformative, the radio as a fundamentally disembodied medium, and experimental radio, like experimental electronic music, as largely the preserve of men. This paper proposes a different artistic point of origin: I insert the writings and radio works of Gertrude Stein as a point of departure into a discussion of embodied radio practices and the work of contemporary artists engaging with transmission to consider broader questions of
the social configuration and significance of networks, aurality and orality, gender play, and the materiality of communication."

Based on the operationalizations of Internet usage in existing empirical studies, the paper proposed a reflective measurement model Sophistication of Internet Usage (SIU). With empirical data from a longitudinal random survey conducted in Hong Kong from 2003 to 2005, a uni-dimension measurement model is established with a confirmatory factor analysis approach. Convergent and discriminant validity of the uni-dimension model has also been tested within MTMM paradigm by confirmatory factor analysis. Finally, alpha, beta, and gamma change of Internet users sophistication of Internet usage across years, which are operationalized as a test of measurement equivalence across years, are also investigated with a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis approach. The theorectical and methodological significances of the study are also discussed."

This paper presents the findings of a series of studies exploring the impact of smaller video format, specifically the Apple iPod, on audience responses. Two experiments were conducted with participants being exposed to one of two presentations on either an iPod or on a 32-inch television. Participants saw either a 10-minute fast-paced (multiple cut) action sequence or a 10-minute slow-paced (long cut) conversation sequence from a feature length motion picture. The two experiments each had a 2 x 2 design examining differences in immersion, spatial presence and social realism dimensions of presence. While previous research suggests that larger format presentations should generally result in higher levels of presence, experiment one found that subjects viewing the iPod reported higher levels of immersion. In experiment two, participants reported higher levels of spatial presence and social realism. The results suggest that sound merits further investigation and arguably should be included in all experiments with audio/visual stimuli. Implications are discussed."

These two professions are dependant on one another; yet, they have a somewhat adversarial relationship. In order to better manage the relationships with journalists more effectively, public relations practitioners need to examine the underlying source of conflicts. To examine this phenomenon, in this study the coorientation model (McLeod & Chaffee, 1973) is used. The coorientation model provides a means to analyze the perceptual balance between public relations practitioners and journalists toward their relationship, which will help public relations practitioners understand the source of conflicts. In particular, perceptions and cross-perceptions are measured in regard to their relationships between South Korean public relations practitioners and journalists, using the organization-public relationship assessment (OPRA) scale developed by Huang (2001).
The results suggest that the two professions had similar perceptions regarding their relationship quality and both groups perceived their relationship as neutral. However, they failed to estimate the others perceptions accurately, and they reported their estimation of each others perceptions differently from their own perceptions. Implications for theory development and public relations practices for managing relationship with journalists are provided."
2008-1223,Space is the Place: Globalization and the New Phenomenological Media of Objects,Filling in the Blanks: Phenomenological Approaches to Embodied Mediation,,,,Paper,Space is the Place: Globalization and the New Phenomenological Media of Objects,Filling in the Blanks: Phenomenological Approaches to Embodied Mediation,"This paper will propose an approach for new methodological qualifications in the research of media spatiality followed by a phenomenological meta-examination of global media. The paper begins with a study of Heideggers tool-analysis, where it is posited that all object relations engage within a sphere of enclosure, or Being, and consist of dual modalities of presence and absence. Features of an object are always disclosed only in part and through the interpretation or usage of a second organism or object. The actuality of the object recedes from view. From this basic premise, the argumentation of this paper follows in this order: 1) Media always first and foremost reflect an intersubjective, mediated interaction between individuals within the space of a maximal global context. 2) Media are by necessity always referentially global in their function, and serve as the prime catalysts that engender globalization. 3) Further the phenomenological experience of locality has necessarily expanded Heideggers conception of thrownness to include a larger sphere of Being. 4) Recent research in phenomenology has begun to mirror some of the concepts of globalizationembodied in this presentation by Harman and Castellsespecially regarding the attempt to account for how change can take place within an enclosed space. 5) Thus, places must also serve as simultaneous enclosures and catalysts for the mediation of specific relational networks."
2008-1224,Speech Without Rights: The Status of Public Space on the Internet,Textures of the Public Sphere,,,,Paper,Speech Without Rights: The Status of Public Space on the Internet,Textures of the Public Sphere,"This article examines the legal status of public space and speech rights on the Internet. I review and analyze court cases that have addressed whether public forums exist on the Internet and thus whether the public has any speech rights in this medium. Analysis of the legal treatment of public spaces online reveals a gap between normative democratic theory and actual practice surrounding public space and serves as a caution against rosy predictions that the Internet will invariably function as an ideal site for democratic communication. The cases examined here show that public forum law has not recognized public space on the Internet. Moreover, public forum laws failure to protect public space online constricts opportunities for communication policies that seek to bolster public spheres of discussion or protect even limited rights of access in this medium. I conclude with a discussion of the alternatives available for recognizing and creating public spaces online."

Previous conceptualizations of dissent have considered the audience, the person to who dissent is directed, but have not considered dissent in the larger context of other organizational members. Specifically, one persons expression of dissent may influence the expression of dissent by others. This study tests these ideas using a database of emails sent and received by employees of Enron shortly before its collapse. Results suggest a network of dissent as employees exchanged messages of dissatisfaction. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of examining dissent from a network perspective."

During election campaigns citizens should be informed as thoroughly and as precisely as possible regarding their alternatives. The problem is that elections today are commonly thick with charges that party campaigns and their media coverage are all spin, no substance. The electoral sins by politicians and journalists fuel voter apathy and public disinterest that damage the health of any democracy.
The United States, Great Britain, Germany, and Israel among others, have recently seen an expanding role played by communication consultants and political PR specialists also known as spin-doctors. The latter have affected public opinion, the media and elections worldwide. It seems that the manipulation of the media, and eventually the voting public, has reached new levels. PR has become integral to the conduct of politics.
We are entering a new era in political marketing and election politics. Spinning, the art of bending the truth, spin-doctors and their role during election campaigns ? based on the case study of the 2006 Israeli elections ? will be the research topic of this paper."

The purpose of this research is to determine whether the independent variables of spokescharacters appearance and behavior impact purchase influence/intention with children. Two hundred fifty-eight children (N = 258) participated in this experiment, which employed a between-subjects design. Overall results showed a main effect for spokescharacter behavior; no main effect for spokescharacter appearance was a found. Main effects also were found for cognitive level of development, thereby yielding useful results for both advertising scholars and practitioners targeting children."

For example, the use of overhead cameras that provide viewers with a subjective, first-person point of view while watching games has become commonplace in sports broadcasts. This study seeks to examine the effects of these Skycam shots on sportsfans and non-sportsfans emotional response to sports broadcasts and their sense of presence or immersion in the viewing experience. In accordance with mood management theory, the increased arousal elicited via subjective camera could play a role in explaining viewer enjoyment of mediated sports. Moreover, this study aids in the development of a theory of presence by examining one cause of presence, subjective camera angle, in the context of sports broadcasts."

Viewers (n = 113) of a college football game in an intense rivalry context reported their responses to the game online during commercial breaks. The multilevel models analysis of the longitudinal data show that shifts in both positive and negative affect influence suspense of fans of both teams. Likewise, affective dispositions emerge as precondition for greater suspense, regardless of specific team preference. Predictions regarding increased suspense due to lower certainty of the preferred teams victory and due to smaller score difference were only supported for fans of the winning team."

The alleged crime sparked intense journalistic interest in the United States and drew media attention from as far away as Europe and Australia. Fifteen months later, the charges were dropped, the players were declared innocent, and the district attorney who prosecuted the case had been disbarred and sent to jail. This qualitative textual analysis, which examines stories in four U.S. newspapers, explores how the media framed the incident, focusing on depictions of rape and sexual assault, the accuser and the accused, and college athletics. The analysis also examines how Dukes public relations effort, which positioned the university as a victim of rumors and prejudice and a beacon of reason during a media frenzy, influenced media coverage."

Other studies have shown that even some groups of untrained judges viewing videos of subjects faces can detect deception at levels significantly higher than chance (Ekman &OSullivan 1991, Ekman, OSullivan & Frank 1999). The current study tests if there are reliable cues to deception given off in a subjects body movement while waiting in a cue, and their in gait while approaching a check-point screener. A sample of naïve judges is compared to a law enforcement group trained in a behavioral coding technique. The study examines what if any reliable cues are given off in gait and body movement, and if training affects the accuracy of judgments made."

Developing a late Foucauldian approach to celebrity consumption, I argue that consumers of celebrity are engaging in technologies of star testing. Ultimately, the paper is concerned to elaborate the ways in which celebrity consumption hooks up with larger discursive structures and thereby helps to materialize a re-constitution of the relationship between labor, government, and self necessary for the social reproduction of neo-liberal capitalism."

The theoretical framework used to perform this analysis and subsequent findings will be discussed. As an ever-increasing number of people access health information online and as user-generated videos continue to grow in popularity, social networking sites are becoming an important source of consumer health information. Viewers tend to be highly trusting of the content in user-generated videos developed by their peers, a finding which has not gone unnoticed by large corporations such as pharmaceutical companies who have hired firms to study the impact of user-generated videos on the behaviour of viewers. As advertisers continue to recognize the potential for reaching the youth market through social networking sites, increasing concerns have been raised about the authenticity of the information in these video uploads. Particularly worrisome to health researchers and practitioners alike are stealth marketing techniques, calculated covert strategies employed by large corporations to market their products to this characteristically hard-to-reach demographic under the guise of authentic user-generated videos. At the same time, an important opportunity exists for healthcare practitioners and researchers to analyze and harness the potential of Internet technology and user-generated videos to promote health, by conveying important health information in an attempt to enact healthy lifestyle behaviours in populations."

Bush. In addition, the films direct influence on aversive feelings toward Senator John F. Kerry (D-MA), an attitude object not referred to in the film, is hypothesized and empirically assessed. The film produces increased feelings of affective aversion toward Bush and reduced aversion toward Kerry. In addition, feelings toward both candidates influence subsequent perceptions of candidate debate superiority. Most importantly, varied processes of influence are found to exist across those subjects who identified themselves as Bush supporters versus Kerry supporters prior to the stimulus phase of the experiment. In addition, varied relationships between Bush-aversion and Kerry-aversion are found to exist between Bush and Kerry supporters relative to viewing Moores film. The ramifications of these findings for the study of affect and media effects are outlined and future lines of research are summarized."

Through narrative analysis and in-depth interviews, my research contributes to the dialogue surrounding female audiences negotiation of meaning when interacting with a seemingly anti-feminist text. Additionally, my research contributes to the overall conversation regarding the critical role the mass media play in shaping attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of gender roles and norms. Many of the common characteristics emphasized on Beauty and the Geek have historically been categorized as damaging, creating or fostering negative stereotypes that have the potential to negatively shape opinions and distort reality. Past research argues that TV has the power to influence audiences and reinforce an image that may weaken womens role in business, family and social settings. In this study, I analyze the exaggerated gender stereotypes portrayed on the show Beauty and the Geek, the stereotypical nature of the transformation process experienced by the main characters, the elements of production that work to mask and normalize these stereotypes, and finally, young female audience members negotiation of meaning."

In the constrained social space online they must alter their behaviour and social interaction to suit a mass audience, both the actual community online but also the audience and lurkers in those communities. Ordinary people are playing for stakes in the sense that they risk being monitored. Thus we seem to be faced with a situation where people will start to, need to or will even have to learn to guard themselves from the pitfalls of web 2.0, when their communicative actions become clustered or undergo other kinds of metamorphic multimedia treatment.

On the other hand the fact that people can trace other peoples activities online creates not only the manifest raw material for a personal narrative but also a sense of being recognizable, as being someone in the media. Through television shows such as Big Brother there seem to be a demand for monitoring and 'people watching' as a well liked activity have very much been part of the reality TV experience through the years and is somehow become acceptable and in fact a trust building practice. The pleasures of being monitored more or less guarantees recognition or at least set up the platform for people to become somebody in the media and in society at large."

While narrative and narrative theorizing fed into innovative and transformative teaching orientations and practices, that are more culturally, ethnically and racially sensitive, it is unclear thus far whether and how the narrative turn can result in contributions that are more user-based and user-oriented. I will address this gap and begin to work toward strategies that attempt to close it."

Questions of truth and falsehood are paramount during our present age of global uncertainty. In honor of three recently departed philosophers of communication (Rorty, Baudrillard and Watzlawick) this paper clarifies the philosophical premises which makes our discipline matter today. Through textual analysis, I detail how pragmatist, postmodernist, and interactional perspectives have contributed to the field of communication. Eisenberg?s (2007) concept of ?strategic ambiguity? suggests that polysemia in discourse can be used for strategic purposes. The potential for strategic ambiguity to be employed for manipulative purposes is an ethical concern that is raised. Condit?s (2006) theory of relationality is analyzed in the context of pragmatism. This paper notes the epistemological similarities between reframing and spin. It highlights the constitutive power of language and offers hope for resolving seemingly intractable social problems."

The Malawi Radio Diaries is a program in which HIV-positive men and women openly discuss day-to-day events in their lives with the goal of reducing stigma in the population. Using a baseline population-based household survey for a communication campaign in Malawi, we determined the important dimensions of stigma in the population and the demographic and psychosocial correlates of these dimensions. We then used a midterm household survey to determine the relationship between exposure to the Radio Diaries program and stigma. Important dimensions of stigma included isolation of people with HIV/AIDS and secrecy about HIV status. In multivariate analyses, exposure to the Radio Diaries program was not associated with stigma, but there was a significant interaction between exposure and efficacy to reduce number of partners. This relationship held when exposure to other intervention elements was controlled. We introduce the term benevolent neglect to describe peoples proclivity to disregard stigmatizing differences between themselves and others when they feel efficacious, but not when they feel powerless."

This study looks at whether having strong convictions on social issuesboth emotional and cognitiveinfluences how citizens react to the policy debates in the mass media surrounding issues that are important to them; it further examines whether convictions translate into a willingness to take action. Respondents levels of conviction were measured on three social issues  the Iraq war, gun control, and abortion  after which, they were exposed to a stimulus that mimicked a policy debate on one of these topics. The stimulus consisted of a short op-ed piece on the issue, and several brief letters to the editor reflecting different viewpoints. Respondents then took a follow-up questionnaire. Findings indicate that having strong conviction on several political issues is associated with participation. Having conviction on a single issue led to participating on behalf on that issue in some instances. Additionally, findings show that having strong convictions on an issue does not consistently result in emotional response to media debates on an issue."
2008-1245,"Struggling With Reality: Technology and Aesthetic Realism in ""Game Developer"" Magazine",Game Studies High Density Paper Session,,,,Paper,"Struggling With Reality: Technology and Aesthetic Realism in ""Game Developer"" Magazine",Game Studies High Density Paper Session,"The purpose of this article is to examine the relationships among the uses of digital technology, discourses on aesthetic and physical realism, and the mimetic impulses in video game production. I theorize these relationships using the critical and aesthetic theories of Theodor Adorno. Although autonomous art takes center stage in Adornos work, the positing of popular art in relation to it points to the way in which to examine the video game industrys compulsion toward realism using new technology. The concept of mimesis is applied to the discourses of language used in discussions around technology and aesthetic realism found in video game production. Additionally, the compulsion to realism is expressed as it is related to the newness of technology, and thus the development of technique becomes an essential component to the creation of digital media content. A textual analysis was undertaken on all stories and articles that mention realism in Game Developer magazine, a monthly publication for an industry-professional audience, from May 2004 to February 2007. When video game developers are tasked with simulating realistic objects, they run up against technological limitations in the mimesis of natural and physical properties. Aesthetics is used to overcome these limitations. Creating realistic characters in video games shares a similar disposition to technological limitation, but there is an added element that confronts the subjects experience in a way that speaks to a sense of unease when an object strives for its identity in its nonidentitythe identity of the subject."

Nagging involves an exchange in which a student makes persistent requests of an instructor who fails to comply. The purpose of the study was to examine student nagging behavior and, specifically, to examine nagging as a potentially face threatening act as a part of Politeness Theory. Students (N = 189) described a nagging exchange with an instructor by reporting on 1 of 8 nagging strategies. Nagging is threatening to the positive and negative face of both students and instructors, with the Elicit Sympathy nag the most threatening to the students positive face, and the Demonstrate Frustration with the Instructor nag the most threatening to the instructors positive face. The Strike a Deal nag was found to be the most threatening to the students negative face, and the Flatter Instructor nag the most threatening to the instructors negative face. The majority of these face threatening acts are committed off record, or indirectly, and with a degree of ambiguity."

However, there is increasing evidence that collocated members may form subgroups characterized by an us-verse-them attitude.This research is aimed to gain a better understanding of subgroup dynamics in virtual teams. We hypothesize that subgroup identification has negative impacts on team processes such as conflict and team learning behaviors, as well as harmful effects on team outcomes such as performance and satisfaction. The effects are moderated by team identification, such that negative effects of subgroup identification will only occur when team identification is low."

This study, based on a textual analysis and interviews with the famous Soviet-Russian journalist, Inna Rudenko, provides some insights into Rudenkos journalism and her complicated political interactions with editors and the Communist Party elite during and after the Brezhnev leadership. In the totally censored press, Rudenko elaborated methods and tactics to bypass censorship to critically assess the implementation of socialist ideas. Her criticism went beyond the boundaries outlined for the media, making the Soviet rulers furious every time when an editor or a censor missed Rudenkos subversive message. Rudenkos work is an example of a journalism that highlighted the discrepancy between officially proclaimed statements and everyday experience of Soviet people, revealing contradictions of socialist development. Rudenkos experience might be guidance for the contemporary Russian journalists who, being dependent on governments, are not free to report and interpret events of public importance. This is why Russian journalists need to learn again how to send messages readable between the lines."
2008-1249,Suffering in Corporate Communication: Visibility and Agency in Aid Appeals,Mediation and Proper Distance,,,,Paper,Suffering in Corporate Communication: Visibility and Agency in Aid Appeals,Mediation and Proper Distance,"Contemporary humanitarian campaigning, influenced by corporate
communication strategies, often keeps images of distant sufferers out of
visibility or denies these sufferers any form of agency over their
misfortune. Whereas such practices of representation respond to
long-standing criticisms of the humanitarian movement as perpetuating a
sentimental politics of pity or as leading to compassion fatigue, they
fail to address a key ethical claim of humanitarianism: to grant
sufferers with their own, distinct humanity and to address western
publics as citizens acting on distant others with a sense of care and
responsibility. Drawing on empirical examples from the 'World Food
Programme' and the 'Making Poverty History' campaigns, this presentation
explores how the concept of 'proper distance' helps us critique the
current corporate communication practices of humanitarian appeals and
reflect on more inclusive and just representations of suffering."
2008-1250,"Support for Government Actions in a Probable Pandemic Flu Outbreak: Exploring Roles of Social Structure, Trust, Risk Perceptions, Media, and Knowledge","Plague, Pandemic, and Catastrophe: Preparation and Response",,,,Paper,"Support for Government Actions in a Probable Pandemic Flu Outbreak: Exploring Roles of Social Structure, Trust, Risk Perceptions, Media, and Knowledge","Plague, Pandemic, and Catastrophe: Preparation and Response","This study develops and tests an exploratory model that illustrates complex relationships among multiple individual- and societal-level factors to predict the publics support for government actions in a pandemic flu outbreak. Our analysis of a state-representative telephone survey among 1,302 adults reveals that the level of support varies by type of government action and across social structural and geographic segments. But trust in government and risk perceptions seem to play a significant role in predicting the support for governments movement restriction and resource allocation, while media and knowledge do not. Our findings suggest that public health and risk communicators should reinforce support for controversial actions through trust-building and personalization of risks rather than mere education or publicity, while recognizing that some of this support may erode when it impacts everyday life."

In this study, we can find that the websites provide an important tool for married bisexual men to get social support, and the websites provide experimental experiences for the bisexuals to construct the comprehension of bisexual sexuality. Additionally, the Internet provides opportunities for married bisexual men to search for the real self and release their pressure from marriage. Additionally, the bisexuals use the websites to socialize, realize themselves, develop friendship networks, and even find romance. The websites serve an alternative way for bisexuals to come out and transfer into a bisexual lifestyle."

Although miscarriages do not typically cause physical harm to women, they cause significant distress, leading in some cases to depression, anxiety, or other psychological disorder. Prior research indicates that social support may help to moderate distress and prevent long-term psychological harm. However, it does not provide much detail about communication behavior that is viewed as more and less supportive by women who have miscarried. In the current paper, we present a rationale for a research agenda focused on supportive communication in the context of miscarriage. This rationale includes a review of existing research on social support and miscarriage, the articulation of a communication perspective on social support, and the analysis of miscarriage as a stressor with implications for support needs, support seeking, and support provision. We conclude by sketching an agenda for research and theoretical development."

Researchers often describe such survey data as hard or objective, drawing a distinction with complementary, qualitative data gathered through (for example) in-depth interviews or participant observation. The author employed household resource surveys as part of a nine-month ethnographic study of the impact of community-based natural resource management in Mukungule, Zambia. Implementation of the surveys in this setting proved challenging, however, and required significant flexibility in the field. While survey data often provide formative detail essential for designing effective social communication strategies, in this case it was ethnographic detail that revealed flaws in the standard survey design. These findings underscore the need to revisit accepted methodologies and the importance of unconventional thinking in applying what might appear to be conventional methods."

Drawing upon Bourdieus field theory, part one considers the conditions under which sustainability becomes an issue. It explores the linkages between different types of alternative media and specific social groups and movements and how these relationships are linked to these organizations life cycles. It also examines some of the different dimensions of sustainabilitysuch as funding, personnel, content creation, expertise, production equipment, and work space  and how the issue is inflected differently in the context of different kinds of media. Part two provides three short case studies of American organizations created to enhance the stability of alternative media organizationsthe Independent Press Association of New York, the Media Consortium, and the Grand Rapids Community Media Center. It provides an overview of the political economic context and operation of these organizations and critically considers how they address the dimensions of sustainability raised earlier in the paper. Conclusions are drawn about the conditions under which sustainability becomes an issue and how employing different organizational strategies and forms might work to help mitigate the problem"

This article considers the extent to which online forums and discussions about Lost serve as a location for increased understanding about religious difference. Following Henry Jenkins (2006) argument that online fan discussions comprise collective intelligence that feeds into the creative processes of the media industries, this article explores the ways in which online fans made sense of the religious and philosophical references of the program as well as the directions the series seemed to follow as a result. Using the mediatization of religion as a theoretical framework, the article considers how these online forums served as the locations through which fans expressed religious ideas in relation to mystery and a desire for narrative resolution in relation to television."

Symbolic interdependence is positively correlated with relationship quality. However, a potential mediating variable between symbolic interdependence and relationship quality lies in the form of imagined interactions; covert dialogues with relational partners whereby individuals imagine talking with others thereby allowing a mechanism to mentally examine and espouse values while facilitating catharsis. Intimate couples in long-standing relationships and random-paired couples were examined in order to test the degree of symbolic interdependence. LISREL models among intimate couples revealed the partial mediation of imagined interaction between symbolic interdependence and relationship quality compared to alternative models."
2008-1257,Symbolic Production and Value in the Media Industries,Power and Value Under Neoliberalism,,,,Paper,Symbolic Production and Value in the Media Industries,Power and Value Under Neoliberalism,"To say that the media have become commercialized has become a standard opening for debates on the changes within the media over the past few decades, not least concerning changes in the European media landscape, or to the developments within the post-Soviet states. Indeed, the media in Europe have seen dramatic changes, some of which have to do with the increased competition between public service and commercial broadcast media, leading to the fact that more media production is aiming for producing surplus value and economic profits. (Print and music media, however, have since long, and with few exceptions, been organized commercially.) However, economic value is but one of the value forms produced within the media and cultural industries, maybe especially so in media environments marked by both strong commercial media companies and strong public service enterprises. It might therefore be worthwhile to analyse the conditions for the production of other kinds of value (political, social, cultural, etc.) in such settings.

In this paper is discussed a model for analyzing the production of value within media and cultural industries, based in the field theory outlined by Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu, however, did for the most part discuss the production of value (or forms of capital) in relation to fields of restricted cultural production, that is, within the fine arts (e.g. art, literature). Although one of his most known works dealt with television, one cannot say that he thoroughly enough used the possibilities inherent in his own theory to analyse this field of mass production. This paper seeks to contribute to the development of a theory of value production in fields of large-scale production."

Since his election in 2000, Taiwan's president Chen Shui-bien has had to alternate between taiwan and ROC to strike a balance among conflicting ideas about Taiwans national identity. The act is grounded in complex political discourse dictating that Taiwan must not be seen as separate from the Sinic world and simultaneously to respond to steadily rising Taiwanese consciousness. Facing intercessions by the United States and China, as well as ever-present domestic clashes, rhetorical exigency requires the president to fashion unique political discourse concerning what Taiwan is and ought to be. This study explores how these names and related expressions are used in Chen's public addresses to the nation and how their development reflects the struggle over Taiwans national identity."

Through campus polling and ethnographic market research, the network identified gay rights as a predominant cultural issue among young people. The campaign began with a film addressing Matthew Shepards murder and featured a series of PSAs  Snaps  that used techniques of Soviet montage to rupture antigay attitudes. This paper scrutinizes MTVs investments in promoting tolerance highlighting that the campaign was often contradictory, e.g., promoting rapper Eminem while also critiquing hate speech. To what extent were the networks efforts a strategic use of gay content to lure quality youth audiences, i.e., through connoting hipness? How did the MTV campaign engage with cultural work undertaken by student campaigns challenging homophobia? Drawing insights from the MTV case, this paper explores the implications of corporate-sponsored social marketing upon contemporary social activism on gay rights."
2008-1260,Taking Communication Rights Seriously,Reimagining Structure and Agency,,,,Paper,Taking Communication Rights Seriously,Reimagining Structure and Agency,"Communication media are widely considered to be fundamental to contemporary transformations in the theory and practice of citizenship. This paper will examine media-related social practices that are widely seen as causes of transformations in theories of the political in general, and of citizenship in particular. Focusing on citizenship, the paper will highlight the role of media institutions as political institutions. In doing so, it will examine the idea of a right to communicate, an idea that has been sustained in transnational policy discourse for more than thirty years. Consistent with the multiplicity of competing rights claims that can be found across the spectrum of contemporary global social movements, today a similarly broad spectrum of communication rights claims exists. On the one hand, this spectrum is viewed as a progressive rainbow coalition, while on the other hand, some of these claims are in competition. This paper will focus on two major issues that can help guide theory and practice about communication rights. The first is the cost of rights, and the second is the enforceability of rights. For illustrative purposes, the paper will examine selected communication rights claims that have been made in recent transnational policy forums."

The proliferation of telecenters at different levels, initiatives, and organizations offers an opportunity to examine reasons for successes and failures.
Questions surround the importance of both agency (Bourdieu, 1984) and sustainability (Proenza, 2001). Greatest local impact and sustainability seems to come from local initiatives by NGOs which obtain outside support compared to local organizations. Another key issue involves building capability by education, virtual training, on-site training by center monitors (staff), and integration with school programs. Tentatively, the most common and effective training is one-on-one by telecenter staff.
The paper builds a typology of telecenter programs in Brazil. Specific programs examined include Digital Communities, Cultural Centers and village programs operated by specific federal ministries. Post office and telecommunication company kiosks seemed promising for villages but have not been as effective as schools and telecenters. Another interesting layer consists of commercial access and videogame centers.
This paper is based on a national census of telecenters in Brazil conducted by ONID (Observatório Nacional de Inclusão Digital) initiated by federal, state and local programs, supplemented by an annual online survey in 392 participating telecenters in São Paulo and by studies of a large in-school digital access and training program in rural areas."

To do this, we employed an ethnographic case study approach, focusing on an advanced level course on Gender, Ethnicity and Communication at a predominantly white liberal arts college. Three types of data were collected: observational fieldnotes, in-depth interviews with all twenty-five students, and student response papers. Four strategies were identified: silence, laughter, saying ""whites do that too"" and metacommunication. The first three strategies were viewed in conflicting ways and often served to end discussion. The final strategy seemed to be promising in terms of its potential to promote more genuine dialogue among students."

In an experiment focusing on marijuana and inhalant prevention with pre-adolescent/adolescent participants, scripted focus groups were shown discussing a series of three television ads selected from the Partnership for a Drug Free America national campaign. Based on Psychological Reactance Theory, focus groups were manipulated so as to contain either adult or peer members (source) using either explicit or implicit language in their commentary (language type). Results indicate that, adult sources using implicit language are perceived more positively than adults using explicit language and more positively than peers using either language type. When it comes to ad evaluations, it is clear that adults using explicit language elicit more derogation than adults using implicit language. For peers, language use makes no difference in ad evaluations. This is an important finding in that differences in ad evaluations were obtained despite the fact that ads were identical. In sum, the results highlight the key role played by source and language features in shaping responses to discussions about mass media ads as well as to the ads themselves."

In two telephone population surveys, both the potential precursors to and the potential effects of these kinds of discussion were explored. In study 1 (N=2807), participants who reported increased cognitive and affective responses to a sun-protection message were more likely to have discussed it. In study 2 (N=151), affective responses were associated with talking about a message focusing on the link between overweight-obesity and cancer. In both studies, participants who talked about the message were more likely to report recent behavior in accordance with the message, though discussion was not associated with intentions, suggesting that the act of discussion influences behavior through a process that is independent of conscious intentions. The implications of these results are considered at the theoretical and applied level."

The study also tested whether differences in message recognition or recall would emerge between the four experimental conditions. Results of inferential statistical analysis revealed an anticipation x conversation interaction with attitude toward behavior as the dependent variable. There was also an anticipation of conversation main effect such that participants in the no anticipation conditions recalled significantly more information about the health messages than participants in the anticipation conditions. Theoretical and practical significance of the studys findings are discussed by the author.

Classical and modern theories on ethos are used, and it is argued that the mentioned companies use four overarching strategies: They claim to improve the world, they say they clean up their own act, they point to approval from others, and they argue that they care about you. The rhetoric is found wanting in some respects, and a yardstick for evaluating the forwarded claims is also suggested."
2008-1267,Talking to Doctors About Clinical Trials,Communicating Policies and Procedures in Health Delivery,,,,Paper,Talking to Doctors About Clinical Trials,Communicating Policies and Procedures in Health Delivery,"This study uses results of a RDD telephone survey of a national sample of U.S. adults (N = 500) to investigate factors relating to individuals willingness to talk with their doctors about clinical trials and their intentions to participate in future clinical trials. Predictor variables are the perceived fairness of doctor-patient interactions and trust in doctors; controls include demographics, clinical trial awareness, prior experience with clinical trials, visits to doctors in the last 12 months, and personal health status. Using hierarchical regression, the results showed that when respondents were more positive about the fairness of interactions and more trusting of their doctors, they were also more willing to talk to their doctors about clinical trials. There was a positive relationship between willingness to talk and intentions to participate in future trials but no relationship between trust in doctors and intentions to participate. A negative relationship between the perceived fairness of interactions and intentions to participate emerged when we entered willingness to talk to doctors into the model. It appears that when respondents were more negative about their interactions with doctors but still willing to talk to their doctors about clinical trials, they were more likely to express intentions to participate. In contrast, respondents who were more positive about their interactions with doctors and also willing to talk to their doctors about clinical trials were less likely to express intentions to participate. We reflect on possible explanations for this unexpected finding in the conclusions."

In this paper, we will discuss mobile phone interactions between parents and children as an example of the reflexive process by which everyday language, technologically mediated interactions, and cultural models create each other. We will firstly draw on data from a corpus of biographies of mobile phones collected during a qualitative research on the adoption of the technologies in the family. The analysis of informants discursive accounts reveals how mobile phone interactions between parents and children are framed by already existing cultural models of parenting. We will then take into account conversational data from an ethnographic field study on everyday communication through mobile phone. By an analysis of naturally occurring telephone conversations, we will show how participants construct their cultural models of being a parent and being a child in and through their ways of speaking on the mobile."

The goals of this project were to conduct a content analysis of popular womens magazines targeting teens through middle aged women to determine the messages being presented about skin cancer, prevention, and the outcomes of tanning. Magazine included were Cosmo Girl, Seventeen, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Redbook, Shape, and Fitness. Analysis found that 75% of the articles did not includ risk information when reporting on tanning and sun exposure. The most frequently reported consequences of tanning were aged skin. Looking healthy/having a healthy glow was most frequently mentioned benefits of tanning. Of prevention methods, sunscreen use noted most frequently in 57% of the articles. However, articles failed to promote other sun protection measures such as seeking shades, avoiding the sun during peak hours, and wearing protective clothing. Implication for future research and practice are discussed."

Set in contemporary Cambodia, using Khmer-speaking actors and actresses, Taste of Life followed the loves and lives of a group of nursing students. In addition to its health educational content, Taste of Life portrayed complex social issues affecting contemporary Cambodia. Extensive audience research found that the drama: was appreciated and watched both for its entertainment and educational value; provided role models and inspirational heroes, who modelled constructive responses to an array of contemporary issues and problems; and was associated with higher levels of attitudes and behaviours related to HIV and AIDS and maternal and child health. This paper presents evidence of how audiences noted their society reflected and the messages they understood from their engagement with the drama."
2008-1271,Tattoo Therapy: Gender and Healing on Reality TV,The Gender Politics of Emotion Management in Contemporary Media and Performance,,,,Paper,Tattoo Therapy: Gender and Healing on Reality TV,The Gender Politics of Emotion Management in Contemporary Media and Performance,"This paper argues that therapeutic narrative normalizes tattooing and that women tattoo artists, unlike their male counterparts, claim the role of emotional healers. The popular reality TV shows, Miami Ink and LA Ink, signal the ubiquity of tattooing. Male and female clients offer stories to explain the therapeutic significance of their new tattoos. This discourse reminds us that our bodies are called upon to represent our identity; tattoos act as a visual shorthand for longwinded talk therapy. The role of the tattoo artist in this therapeutic transformation, however, differs depending on the artists gender. Women artists speak frequently of the bodily intimacy of tattooing and of their role as providers of comfort and healing. By making their therapeutic role explicit, women artists, themselves outsiders in an outsider culture, similarly justify their work in the normalized, psychotherapeutic terms that dominate self-help culture in the contemporary U.S."

One evening after a group of lesbian friends finished watching the first two seasons of the Showtime series The L word, a show that portrays the lives of a group of upper class lesbians in California, they began discussing their views on the dramatic series. One of the women asked, what would a Cuban version of the L-Word look like? It was from that discussion that the T con T Collective emerged. We decided to complete our own alternative documentary style-video production that would reflected the lives of a group of lesbians in Havana, Cuba.

2008-1273,"Teacher Immediacy, Confidence Testing, and the Measurement of Cognitive Learning",Teacher and Student Dynamics in Instructional Communication,,,,Paper,"Teacher Immediacy, Confidence Testing, and the Measurement of Cognitive Learning",Teacher and Student Dynamics in Instructional Communication,"While research on teachers immediacy behaviors and student learning has been popular, there is much disagreement concerning the appropriate means to measure cognitive learning. Significant differences have emerged between studies that rely on perceptual vs. performance measures of learning. Performance measures have often been criticized for a lack of ecological validity while perceptual measures lack conceptual fit and have been accused of reflecting a halo effect in judgment toward teachers. The present study sought to compare instruments commonly used in this research to assess immediacy and perceived learning with actual course grades. In addition, a new approach to assessment of cognitive learning, confidence testing, is included. Results indicate that confidence testing scores are significantly associated with both course grades and perceived learning. Implications for research involving cognitive learning are discussed."
2008-1274,Teaching Democracy? Exploring the Effects of Civic Education Programs in New Democracies,"Media Issues of Citizenship, Environment, and Health",,,,Paper,Teaching Democracy? Exploring the Effects of Civic Education Programs in New Democracies,"Media Issues of Citizenship, Environment, and Health","The scholarly debate over the requisites of political development and democracy has produced a wealth of empirical cross-national research. A number of researchers have explored the role of educational expansion and the spread of mass literacy in facilitating the process of democratization, but fewer have examined the role of civic education in promoting democratic ideals. Operating from the belief that new democracies are most likely to be sustained when the populace endorses the values and norms inherent in democratic regimes, civic education programs among youth and adult populations have become commonplace in developing democracies (Finkel and Ernst, 2005). Thus far, however, the majority of scholarly research in this area has focused on the effects of these programs among young people in established democracies, rather than a broad range of age groups in the context of developing democracies. This paper sets out to explore the effects of civic education programs in new democracies, presenting a review of the literature on civic education in order to assess the utility of such programs in developing democracies. First, the paper provides an overview of key concepts related to civic education, and then provides an in-depth analysis of two relevant areas of research: political socialization and the knowledge gap. Next, the paper reviews evaluations of civic education programs in established democracies and new democracies, focusing on the implications of these findings for the design and evaluation of future civic education programs in new democracies. The paper concludes by offering recommendations and directions for future research."
2008-1275,Teaching Intercultural Communication in an Institute with Predominantly Hispanic Student Population: Challenges and Strategies,Challenges of Teaching Intercultural Communication in Response to Global Changes,,,,Paper,Teaching Intercultural Communication in an Institute with Predominantly Hispanic Student Population: Challenges and Strategies,Challenges of Teaching Intercultural Communication in Response to Global Changes,"The University of Texas-Pan American is located on the U.S./Mexico border with 86% of its student population being Hispanic. Such a unique student population poses challenges for intercultural communication teaching and learning. The first challenge is caused by the perceived discrepant minority/majority identities of whites and Hispanics between textbooks, which assume whites as the default majority. The comparative method in intercultural communication which uses the white culture as the reference point against which other cultures are examined proves awkward in this context. The method of triangulation is used to allow students to examine at least three cultural groups at a time including their native culture, white culture, and another culture. A second challenge revolves around the fact that the dominant linguistic context of communication in this institute is Spanish in contrast with the default English language context in the textbooks. To overcome this challenge, students are encouraged to explore their native or local Spanish terms for communicative practices, and compare them with their English counterparts. A third challenge is the potential risk of stereotyping and prejudice against this student population due to the many negative views of Hispanics and especially Mexicans. In face of this challenge, the method of desensitization is adopted to allow students to examine critically sensitive concepts through video examples such as movie clips. Such a method makes students less defensive and more willing to do self reflection."

The study attempts to examine how the multicultural environment affects relations between Polish and German students. Specifically, we examine the roles that students from countries other than Poland and Germany play during regular classes on Intercultural Communication and in conflict situations. The results show that there are considerable advantages of the presence of students from other countries. Namely, they create a neutral space for a discussion (providing information about their own sets of values, norms, patterns of behaviour, and styles of communication). At the same time, they often play role of a buffer in relations between Polish and German students, by diverting attention away from the cultural differences and history of Polish  German relations that resulted in long-lasting negative stereotypes and mutual prejudices between the two nations.

The paper is divided into two parts. The purpose of the first part is to present the types of conflict situations most frequently occurring during the classes. Additionally, the solution strategies and their effectiveness will be discussed. In the second part of the paper the opportunities and challenges of the multinational and multicultural character of the community will be discussed in terms of the direct and indirect effects on relations between Polish and German students."

Sesame Workshops Kosovar co-production Rruga Sesam (in Albanian)/Ulica Sezam (in Serbian) seeks to address these needs by providing a single Kosovar television program, broadcast in Albanian and Serbian, that combines a curriculum of basic cognitive skills with lessons promoting mutual respect and understanding and socio-emotional skills. This presentation will highlight the results of a 2007 impact assessment. In a randomized controlled trial with a 6-week intervention, we demonstrate that the show has significant educational impact in its core curricular areas including: building appreciation for and tolerance of ethnic and linguistic diversity, imparting knowledge of and interest in foreign words, strengthening childrens belief in accepting different opinions, and teaching basic mathematics skills of counting and numeral recognition."

The piece is a collage of clips that is disrupted and disruptive, employing formal elements to resist narrative closure or oversimplification. Ultimately, the video attempts to reimagine teen sexualities without the weight of reputations."

It explores how one consumer group, urban teenagers 14-15 years old, in four global cities: Johannesburg (South Africa), Bangalore (India), Munich (Germany) and New York (United States), articulate and negotiate their identities on the ground. Taking into account the transnational television networks reaching them along with government sponsored national and privately owned local ones, the study posed the following questions: What are the teens unique contexts and what are their similarities, whether conceptual or grounded? How does television help them (or not) express their complex of selves? And finally, and perhaps most important for the media scholar, what statement can we make regarding the quality and meaning of television for teens located in specific places and time? Researchers conducted fieldwork in Johannesburg, Bangalore, Munich, and New York during 2003-04. Comparative analysis demonstrated that television was used by the teens as an extension of their ongoing journeys toward selfhood. Their social and cultural backgrounds had given them various competencies through which they viewed the world. Keenly aware of their insecurities and the challenges facing them as young adults, they also reached out to television to relieve stress and help them cope. Their grounded experiences, however, taught them how to appropriate these lessons so as not to step out of the norms of propriety of their immediate social and cultural contexts."
2008-1280,Telecentres and Cyber Cafés: A Case for ICT in Small Business,Digital Inclusion and Exclusion,,,,Paper,Telecentres and Cyber Cafés: A Case for ICT in Small Business,Digital Inclusion and Exclusion,"Telecentre initiatives run by non-profit agents are largely understood as critical access points for digital inclusion. By the same token internet or cyber cafés viewed merely as commercial sites fall outside the purview of non-profit initiatives promoting e-literacy. From a contextual study of small internet cafés in urban and peri-urban Maharashtra, India, we report localization of information and communication technology (ICT).Here, internet technologies localize, find survival niches and in many cases, serve as initiation nodes for first time users. The paper introduces a variety of context specific and commercial immersions of ICT services as part of everyday commerce. We argue for-profit spaces like i-cafes equally contribute to digital immersion in information poor contexts. Non-developmental (read commercial) spaces successfully use ICTs, sustain businesses, generate regular clientele and adapt to local demand. Here, ICT technologies involve and initiate all those who access them at suitable and affordable prices. Can i-cafés do what telecentres supposedly do? In this effort and from a perspective of commercial adoption of ICTs we try to open up debates around telecentres as privileged sites of digital inclusion."

Fewer contextualization cues and reduced opportunities for informal interaction with co-located colleagues have resulted in a sense of isolation which threatens to fragment organizations. Ninety seven telecommuters recreated separate informal interactions that made them feel included and excluded in their organizations, and also reported on their level of social support and casual informal communication with their central office colleagues. Common ground talk, and social support were positively related to organizational identification. Messages of inclusion were associated with higher organizational identification, and messages of exclusion were associated with lower identification, providing direct, message-level support for a structuration theory of identification. Liking for co-workers mediated the relationships between organizational communication and three types of informal communication, common ground talk, inclusion messages, and social support."

Given this, the current study examined the extent to which various aspects of television consumption related to verbally aggressive behaviors during negotiations for intimate physical contact. In general, results show that gender and media consumption variables are related to reported willingness to use verbally aggressive behaviors when seeking physical intimacy. Implications for social policy are discussed and directions for future research are advanced."
2008-1283,Television and Children's Moral Reasoning: Development of a Standardized Measure of Moral Reasoning on Interpersonal Violence,Television in the Home: Moral Reasoning and Parenting Dynamics,,,,Paper,Television and Children's Moral Reasoning: Development of a Standardized Measure of Moral Reasoning on Interpersonal Violence,Television in the Home: Moral Reasoning and Parenting Dynamics,"The purpose of this study was to construct a Standardized Measure of Moral Reasoning on Interpersonal Violence (SMRIV) and to explore the relationship between television exposure and childrens use of moral reasoning strategies. 377 elementary school children from fourth to sixth grade completed questionnaires containing measures on moral reasoning and violent and non-violent television viewing. Results suggested that the SMRIV was a reliable and valid scale of moral development. Regression analyses indicated that exposure to violent television content was positively related to a preference for authority based reasoning about interpersonal violence. Violent television exposure was also a significant predictor of preference for approval oriented reasoning about prosocial dilemmas. Further, non-violent television viewing was positively associated with a preference for perspective based moral reasoning. These findings provide support for a mental model approach."
2008-1284,Television and Cultural Integrity: Historical Perspective on Technology,Reassessing NAFTA and the Cultural Industries,,,,Paper,Television and Cultural Integrity: Historical Perspective on Technology,Reassessing NAFTA and the Cultural Industries,"Fifteen years ago the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) threatened to open a cultural deluge from the USA. In terms of content, distribution technology and money, Hollywood seemed to threaten its neighbors. Audience studies, import figures and content analysis continue to be done, but basic cultural policy positions remain at their pre-NAFTA status. Hollywood films continue to dominate and American television imports remain a significant part of Canadas and Mexicos media landscape. The one element that seems most likely to change the cultural equation in the near term is the technologies of distribution that are changing the economic models of US film and television. The urgent question is: how will this change affect other importing countries? Answering this question requires a step back in history to see how policy and technology have grappled for supremacy over the last half century and how the media were defined culturally in each country."

Building on data derived from prime-time television programs going back more than thirty years, we first review how women have been portrayed on television, with a primary focus on the frequency of their representation, their typical marital status, and the occupations they have been engaged in. Trends in portrayals of women are examined from the Cultural Indicators dataset, going back to the 1970s and extending into the current decade. These analyses show significant changes in the way women have been portrayed, with more frequency of portrayal, more likelihood to see women in traditionally male jobs, and with the rate of women being portrayed as married approaching that of men. These changes lead us to hypothesize that cultivation effects on sexrole traditionalism will diminish or disappear in the 2000s. Comparing recent GSS data to that from the 70s and 80s, our hypotheses are largely confirmed."
2008-1286,Television Consumption in Tijuana,Communication Research in the U.S./Mexican Border Region,,,,Paper,Television Consumption in Tijuana,Communication Research in the U.S./Mexican Border Region,"Historically, there has been a scarcity of studies about the kind of national and foreign supply and its reception of media messages by different audiences in the northwest of Mexico, particularly in the US-Mexico border. However the flow of Mexican and transnational media messages has been studied by a number of scholars in the most important cities of Mexico (Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey), not to say the world. This paper discusses empirical research about exposure and consumption of open transnational TV -both Mexican and US TV are open air, a rare situation in the country- in Tijuana (border to US San Diego, CA) done by a telephone survey (sampling 420 of its habitants).
The transnational open television in the region implies two aspects: on the one hand that the free flow of media production (American and Mexican) and cross-bordering mediated reception in Tijuana has been part of an every day life for the past fifty years, way before the North American Free Trade Agreement between United States, Canada and Mexico, on the other hand, that we are, in some ways, culturally orientated to the ¨American¨.
But most recent findings of Mexican colleagues show that US imports in Mexican open TV have decreased in the last few years, and that audiences prefer by far local over foreign contents. That is mostly the case in this study, but not predominantly. The paper discusses these research findings in relation to the concepts of cross-border mediated interaction, cultural mediations and cultural proximity."
2008-1287,Television Exposure and Core Values,Conceptual Concerns With Cultivation Theory,,,,Paper,Television Exposure and Core Values,Conceptual Concerns With Cultivation Theory,"Limited communication research explores the relationship between media exposure and core values. Nevertheless, research shows that both values and some media effects develop slowly, over a similar time-frame. The current study uses data collected during the second round of the European Social Survey  including a 21-question Schwartz Value Survey  to look at links between individual values and exposure to newspapers, television news and entertainment television, and the internet. It is hypothesized that media exposure may provide a key source of value orientations and the results support this hypothesis with regard to entertainment television and internet exposure."
2008-1288,Television Flows Rather Than Trades,Reassessing NAFTA and the Cultural Industries,,,,Paper,Television Flows Rather Than Trades,Reassessing NAFTA and the Cultural Industries,"What, if any, are the impacts of NAFTA on the Canadian cultural industries, in particular on the French language cultural industries within what has been termed the Quebec nation which is celebrating its 400th anniversary of uninterrupted occupation of a recognized territory, the Canadian province of Québec, by a majority French speaking population? This paper will center on the television industry. It is our contention that the impact of ""free trade"" has rather strengthen the ""national"" character of such North American culturally bounded populations, not through isolation but through increased consumption of cultural products circulating from NAFTA's major partner. One explanation is that the free cross border flow of cultural products, and the appropriation of communication technologies, have long predated any free trade agreement. Also Quebec's cultural industries are interlinked, as are their many and varied audiences. These claims can be sustained through an analysis of television program scheduling."

Looking at questions of historiography, notions of ideology, and the function of television, I will describe some of the structural and ideological constraints on television that might account for these depictions. I will argue that through selective historical obfuscation, the decontextualization of terrorism, and the personalization of terrorism in the forms of certain branded terrorists, these documentaries conflate terrorism and Islam, portray terrorism as a religious or criminal and not a political problem, reproduce common stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims and ultimately reveal much more about American ideology than about Islamic ideology."
2008-1290,"Television Pharmaceutical Advertising: Portrayals of Health Risks, Health-Related Perceptions, and Life Satisfaction",Advertising Structure and Effects,,,,Paper,"Television Pharmaceutical Advertising: Portrayals of Health Risks, Health-Related Perceptions, and Life Satisfaction",Advertising Structure and Effects,"Previous studies typically focused on materialism and perceptions of general others affluence to explain the relationship between television viewing and life satisfaction. This study extends our understanding of such a relationship by demonstrating the mediating roles of health-risk perceptions and health-related self-efficacy beliefs. Surveys were administered to 274 college students at a large Southeastern university, and the data subjected to path analyses. Results reveal that exposure to television pharmaceutical advertising was associated with a higher perception of health risks influencing others, and that perception led to a lower level of life satisfaction. Furthermore, the heightened perception of health risks was related to a lower perception of self-efficacy in maintaining personal health, which in turn led to lower life satisfaction. These results suggest that health-related perceptions other than materialism-related beliefs help establish the association between television viewing and life satisfaction. Other implications are also discussed."
2008-1291,Television Program Avoidance and Personality,tudies in Media Selection and Use,,,,Paper,Television Program Avoidance and Personality,Studies in Media Selection and Use,"Recent communication research indicates that program avoidance is not simply the mirror image of corresponding gratifications  as seen by the uses and gratifications approach. Moreover, personality characteristics have not been linked to avoidance behavior yet, but have been proven to influence program choices substantially. This study combines both perspectives by analyzing the influence of personality on program avoidance. Participants were asked for their reasons to quit a running TV program and filled in a personality inventory with the big five dimensions (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness) plus Risk and Fight Willingness. Results show that almost all personality characteristics influence program avoidance, even if to different degrees. The findings are discussed against the background of gratification and selectivity research."

television as a 'transitional object', this paper investigates three
visual characteristics of television in its pre-digital broadcasting
form: the human face as a primary televisual image (the prevalence of
the head shot), the interface of the screen (its reflective nature), and
the box-like design of the CRT television set (its appearance as a kind
of container). It argues that these three characteristics amounted to
an integrated communicative structure that enabled viewer empathy while
aggregating and containing the representations of others, making
television a key mechanism for the moral imagining of 'humanity' in the
second half of the twentieth century."
2008-1293,Terrorism Coverage in the American and Russian Newsweeks,Comparing Newswork Across Borders,,,,Paper,Terrorism Coverage in the American and Russian Newsweeks,Comparing Newswork Across Borders,"This research examines differences in the political-violence coverage of two magazines, which share the same name and journalistic purpose, but which publish in two disparate news environments. Specifically, this content analysis reveals how the U.S. and Russian editions of Newsweek compare in their coverage of four conflicts, as manifested in their agenda-setting functions and framing devices. The findings support a local-interest agenda for conflict coverage and expose distinctions between how the publications frame terrorism. Generally speaking, the U.S. Newsweek avoided terror-laden terminology, while the Russian Newsweek did not, especially when describing Chechen operatives. Word choices such as these, which are seemingly minor on an individual level, collectively can have a profound impact on how readers interpret political violence. The detailed findings in this study bring to light issues about how journalists portray terrorism and how this coverage maps on to Western journalistic concepts of openness and objectivity. Moreover, the findings offer a path through which to compare the Russian and American media systems by considering how these magazines echo or eschew official discourse."

In a pair of laboratory experiments, mortality salience was activated or not before completing measures of third-person perception and support for government censorship of potentially harmful media content. Although participants across both conditions experienced third-person perceptions, this pattern was exaggerated for participants under greater mortality salience. Mortality salience also predicted stronger endorsement of government censorship of media content. These findings are consistent with the notion that third-person perception is motivated by need for self-enhancement."

Messages derived from persuasion theory were embedded into print media that were disseminated by mail. Controlling for several possible confounding variables, mean comparisons suggest that the school materials significantly increased the perceptual mechanisms that forecast health-related behavior change according to the extended parallel process model (EPPM). Measures of asthma knowledge also rose significantly. These results suggest that the intervention can be used effectively to alter key perceptual and knowledge factors that have the power to create healthier school environments."

Go Sun Smart (GSS), a multi-channel, multi-theoretical campaign has shown positive effects on the sun safety behaviors of employees and guests in a randomized trial at high-altitude ski areas. In initial studies the control group was left untreated, without the benefits of the intervention. This paper reports results of analyses of the effect of GSS on guests at North American ski areas in the original control group areas after they received GSS in year two and provides a replication of the original program evaluation. Results showed support for Hypotheses 1 and 4; guests the original control group ski areas showed improved sun safety after GSS was deployed in terms of increased sun protection (H1) and greater recall of a sun safety message (H4). Hypotheses two and three were not supported in that sunburning (H2) and attitudes and self-efficacy beliefs (H3) did not improve following use of GSS in the original controls. Finally, Hypothesis 5a which predicted that greater exposure to GSS messages would be associated with greater sun protection was partially confirmed. In both experimental groups, greater exposure to GSS messages was associated with greater use of sunscreen, sunscreen lip balm, and face covering, but not for gloves or overall sun protection. There was no support for Hypotheses 5b or 5c predicting improvement in sunburning and attitudes and self-efficacy beliefs regarding sun safety."

We surveyed faculty (n = 306) in liberal arts and sciences departments using a mail survey using the total design method and obtained a 56% response rate. Perceived relative advantage, perceived compatibility, observability, and years teaching at the university produced an R2 of .202 for the adoption of hardware. Perceived relative advantage, perceived compatibility, observability, rewards, years teaching at the university, and percentage of time devoted to research produced an R2 of .30."

Variables including length of the Entertainment-Education serial drama and the post-viewing discussion sessions in their relation to cognitive, attitudinal and behavioral intentional outcomes were examined using experimental design and focus group discussions. It was predicted that the length of the Entertainment-Education serial drama would impact the quality of the intervention. Likewise, it was predicted that the post-viewing discussion sessions would improve the quality of the intervention. It was concluded that the length of the Education-Entertainment serial drama did not produce significant change in the overall efficacy of the intervention. However, the post-viewing discussion sessions when incorporated with the E-E drama series or telenovela did produce significant change in regards to cognitive, attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of the Entertainment-Education intervention. Implication of the findings for future Entertainment-Education interventions is enclosed."

One section of an upper-level Campaign Design & Analysis course (n=31) served as the treatment group with a required service learning group project, while another section (n=34) served as a control group. Participants completed surveys at Week 2 and after completion of the project (Week 15). Students in the treatment condition also made weekly journal entries to provide an opportunity for student reflection as well as qualitative data regarding student experiences and outcomes. While students did not differ at initial evaluation, results indicate that students in the service learning class perceived the overall value of service learning as more essential to students overall educational experiences, and also reported their final project as a more effective class strategy than those in the control class."

We conducted 49 in-depth interviews with federal, state, county, and city government communicators between May and August 2007. The results largely confirm the eight unique public sector attributes incorporated in the decision wheel: politics, public good, legal constraints, media scrutiny, devaluation of communication, poor public perception, lagging professional development, and federalism. The results also identify five additional significant attributes: limited leadership opportunities, differential value placed on internal and external communication, limited financial resources, limited communication evaluation, and playing multiple roles."
2008-1302,Testing the Hostile Media Effect Under Selective Exposure,Exploring Media Bias,,,,Paper,Testing the Hostile Media Effect Under Selective Exposure,Exploring Media Bias,"This paper describes the results of two combined experiments (N=241) which were designed to analyze interdependences between two well-known theories of media effects: the hostile media phenomenon and selective exposure. We could replicate hostile media effects among partisans for and against a controversial urban construction project: subjects perceived a balanced newspaper article as biased against their own opinion. We have further replicated selective media reception dependent on the individuals opinion towards the controversy: partisans read more content which was in line with their own opinion than contrasting content. Most interestingly, if the two effects are tested together, the hostile media effect vanishes. Hence, partisans tend to find bias in content they are forced to read, whereas they perceive it as more neutral if they have selected the article themselves. These results indicate that the design of traditional hostile media studies might artificially induce the perception of hostile media bias."
2008-1303,"Testing the Proximate Casualties Hypothesis: Local Troop Loss, Attention to News, and Support for Military Intervention",News Coverage of Conflict and War,,,,Paper,"Testing the Proximate Casualties Hypothesis: Local Troop Loss, Attention to News, and Support for Military Intervention",News Coverage of Conflict and War,"In academic and policy circles, it is believed that the American public is highly casualties-averse when sending its troops into war, and that as casualties mount the public will increasingly call for withdrawal of troops from foreign military interventions. This study tests a variant of this casualties hypothesis by examining whether the public conceptualizes the human costs of war in local as well as national terms. Using a massive quantity of public opinion data combined with information on deaths to U.S. soldiers in the Iraq war theater between 2003 and 2006, we show that recent deaths to soldiers from a persons home state prompt an increase in the likelihood of the person supporting withdrawal of troops, independent of cumulative national casualties and recent casualties to soldiers from elsewhere in the country. These results are explained in terms of journalism norms that make recent, local casualties salient to consumers of news, who then use this salient information when their opinions about the progress of a war are probed."

Participants (n = 485) were randomly assigned to one of five groups, each receiving one of five different versions of a news story, consistent in length and formatting but differing in tone and frame. The investigators (1) measured readers perceptions of the wars involved parties, Israel and Hezbollah, and (2) identified and compared the specific attributes that readers from each condition group assigned to Israel and Hezbollah. The results demonstrated clear and statistically significant differences in perceptions of Israel and Hezbollah among the five condition groups. Computer content analysis of open-ended responses demonstrated a clear relationship between the version of the news story read by participants and the attributes that the participants assigned to Israel and Hezbollah."
2008-1305,Texturation: A Cultural Materialist View of Media Space,Communication and Space: New Perspectives in Media Studies,,,,Paper,Texturation: A Cultural Materialist View of Media Space,Communication and Space: New Perspectives in Media Studies,"In common sense understandings of the relationship between space and communication the former is often interpreted as a fixed entity, and the latter as a fluid process of flow. This view has also sustained much media theoretical thinking on how certain texts are circulated and consumed in certain contexts. However, recent media transitions and the influx of geographical perspectives, prove that the separation of text and context, space and communication, must been challenged. One way of rethinking the space-communication nexus is through the concept of texturation  a concept that permits us to consider space in terms of fluidity and communication in terms of fixity. By extension, this view leads us back to the critical social theories of Pierre Bourdieu, Henri Lefebvre and Raymond Williams  thinkers who shared a view of communication as a process of cultural and ideological sedimentation."
2008-1306,That Dude is Good! Gender Bias in Online Video Games,The Social Impact of Online Games,,,,Paper,That Dude is Good! Gender Bias in Online Video Games,The Social Impact of Online Games,"Despite the fact that females comprise almost 40 percent of all video game players (ESA 2007), anecdotal evidence suggests that the majority of online game players assume that the people they are playing with and against online are male. As societal gender roles suggest that technologies are inherently masculine (Rothschild 1983; Benston & Balka 1993), we propose that player skill, or performance in game, is the most likely cue for the assumed maleness of others. Additionally, as Cassell and Jenkins (1998) led an extensive discussion into the perceived boyness or girlness of video games based on game genre, the potential for a mediating genre factor on perception of player gender is included. A 3 (casual games, MMOs, and shooting games) x 2 (high performance, low performance) between-subjects experimental design is implemented to test the assumptions of this proposed gender-bias in an experimental setting, and implications for future research and policy are suggested."
2008-1307,"""That Photo"": Police and the Power of Representation",cholar to Scholar: Communication History Interest Group Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Paper,"""That Photo"": Police and the Power of Representation",Scholar to Scholar: Communication History Interest Group Interactive Paper Poster Session,"During the early morning hours of August 31, 1970, Philadelphia Daily News photographer Elwood Smith took a picture of members of Philadelphias Black Panther Party being strip-searched at gunpoint by Philadelphia police officers. The photograph spawned almost instantaneous, passionate responses filling the Daily News editorial page for more than a week. In these responses, readers both lambasted and praised the newspaper for printing the photo, decrying the image as a degrading portrayal of the Black Panthers and lauding the paper for granting audiences the ability to witness for themselves the early morning Philadelphia police raids. Drawing upon local print news coverage, editorials, and letters to the editor, this paper argues that Elwood Smiths photograph captured not only a poignant moment of police action. The multilayered photo simultaneously drew attention to the tenuous space occupied by the Daily News vis a vis city politics and the Philadelphia Police Department. Varied responses to the photo served as a demonstration of both the authority of the image and the news organization that chose to print Elwood Smiths work."

In November 2006, comedian Michael Richardss racist tirade re-ignited a debate long surrounding hate-speech in America: should the N-word be banned or is it speech protected by the First Amendment? Using a legal, historical, and sociological framework, it is argued here that by incorporating the Reconstruction Amendments (13th-15th) in their analysis, as well as a victim-centered approach, the Supreme Court could ban the word nigger without moving down the path toward viewpoint censorship, and move America closer to its stated idealized goal of human equality."
2008-1309,Thats Just Typical: A Psychophysiological Investigation of Cognitive Processing Along the Perceived Reality Continuum,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media II,,,,Paper,Thats Just Typical: A Psychophysiological Investigation of Cognitive Processing Along the Perceived Reality Continuum,High Density Session: Information Processing of Media II,"Recent research has illuminated many aspects of perceived reality  in particular the perceived reality of media stories. We know that an event's typicality plays a large role in its perceived reality (Shapiro & Chock, 2003), that people can quickly assess the perceived reality of even unfamiliar stories (Bradley & Shapiro, 2004), that recognition sensitivity is greater for atypical items, and that recognition decisions are made more conservatively for atypical items (Shapiro & Fox, 2002). A computational model of perceived reality suggests that typical items a densely packed in memory space, whereas atypical items are sparsely packed. Furthermore, moderately typical items take more time to process. This study extended past work by including physiological measures and measuring signal detection memory for moderately typical items. Heart rate data suggest that typical items are quickly judged but moderately typical items require increased cognitive effort. Atypical items were more arousing, better recognized, and recognized with more scrutiny. In terms of memory, moderately typical items performed much like atypical items. These data support the Euclidean distance based model of perceived reality."
2008-1310,The Adversarial Moment: A Study of Short-Form Interviews in the News,News Work Routines,,,,Paper,The Adversarial Moment: A Study of Short-Form Interviews in the News,News Work Routines,"With the point of departure in an analysis of Swedish news journalism, the overall aim of this paper is to discuss the development of a more adversarial, critical or interpretive news journalism. When politicians appear in the news they almost solely participate in interviews. The interview has been described as the adversarial moment in the public sphere (McNair 1999:84) and it plays a crucial role in the political news cycle. The adversarialness of journalism has in a comprehensive way been analyzed by researchers working in the tradition of Conversation Analysis (CA) and it has been claimed that the journalistic initiative has expanded considerably over the last forty years (Clayman and Heritage 2002:236). This research has primarily focused on extensive interviews or news conferences. However, a frequent form of politicians appearances in the news is in short-form interviews in news stories. Such interviews are often heavily edited and reduced to single turns or answers. The more specific aim of this study is to identify the more detailed methods (or communicative techniques) used, when politicians answers are cut and incorporated into news stories, and how these techniques are related to the roles set up for politicians and reporters. What potential relationships are set up between politicians, reporters and the viewers? Swedish television data from 1978, 1993 and 2003 have been analyzed. The analysis shows that in the early period, news journalism appears as a mediator or interrogator. In the latter periods, news journalism becomes more of an interpreter or a critical interrogator."
2008-1311,The African Reception of Global Media,Globalisation: The Next Generation,,,,Paper,The African Reception of Global Media,Globalisation: The Next Generation,"This presentation engages debates concerning the impact of global media on local youth audiences in Africa. Recognising the profound rootedness of media consumption in everyday life, the paper specifically examines the way selected South African youth audiences, differentially embedded in their particular economic and ideological formations, use local and global media texts as part of their ongoing attempts to make sense of their lives. The paper will point to the complex individual and social reasons that lie behind media consumption choices and will argue the deficiencies of the media imperialism thesis with its definitive claims for cultural homogenisation, seen as the primary, or most politically significant, effect of the globalisation of media. The latter part of the presentation gives a brief overview of some of the sparse but suggestive research conducted on youth and global media in other countries in Africa.

Larry Strelitz is a Professor in the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa. His most current research has been in the field of media audience studies and his recently published book examined how a cross-section of South African youth responded to media texts which were produced internationally but broadcast locally."

Within the context of broader political debates about lesbian and gay family, I argue that queer cultural production, and specifically audiovisual production, has an important role to play in ""imaging"" (de Lauretis) kinship queerly  that is, in ""making strange"" familiar familial kinship narratives (Edelman 2004) and imagery. Through the analysis of recent videos by Jean Carlomusto and Richard Fung, I explore how queer autoethnography generates complex, fragmented, and above all ambivalent, accounts of kinship. These ""kinship documents"" interrogate broken and fragmented kinship narratives through the prism of death, illness and migrant or (post)colonial displacement; by beginning from gaps and crises in kinship, they challenge normative accounts of kinship as universal symbolic structure, or as teleological continuity. Integrated into this study is an epistemological attention to how photography and audiovisual media (including, but not limited to autoethnography) contribute to ""performative"" kinship practices. Through the case study of queer autoethnography as an exceptional and marginal, I begin to explore a broader, mutually constitutive relationship between visual technologies and kinship."
2008-1313,The Anticipated Adoption of Ambient Intelligent Appliances in Domestic Settings,Psychology of Technology Adoption,,,,Paper,The Anticipated Adoption of Ambient Intelligent Appliances in Domestic Settings,Psychology of Technology Adoption,"Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a growing interdisciplinary area in which the focus is shifted towards users instead of merely emphasizing the technological opportunities of AmI. Different methods are employed to understand the adoption of AmI appliances by users. However, these are often small-scale methods that focus on specific subgroups. Large-scale quantitative studies to understand the adoption of AmI appliances are scarce. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to examine how the Dutch people (n = 1221) perceive AmI appliances in domestic settings. Findings showed that intention to adopt AmI appliances was low and that respondents had a negative to neutral attitude towards AmI appliances. On the basis of structural equation analysis, the results suggest that adoption of AmI appliances could be explained by outcome expectancies of AmI appliances. The potential implications of these findings are discussed."
2008-1314,The Appearance of Diversity: Visual Design and the Public Communication of EU Identity,Visual Sign and Design,,,,Paper,The Appearance of Diversity: Visual Design and the Public Communication of EU Identity,Visual Sign and Design,"Over the past few years, attempts to visually render and ultimately also brand European identity in EU public communication have overwhelmingly revolved around the notion of cultural diversity, which has indeed become a prominent buzzword in the promotion of the EU as an identity project. With the creation of a Directorate General for Communication within the European Commission and the increasingly established belief that EU public communication needs to be more attractive, the discourse of EU identity has shifted from a site of contestation and, then, reification to a site of branding and ever more so furious symbolic production. The core collection of unifying EU symbols such as the flag, the anthem, Europe day and the United in Diversity motto has been complemented by a proliferation of initiatives for the creation of visual imagery highlighting the diverse and pluralistic nature of European culture. This paper discusses three different examples of EU-related visual production, namely Koolhaas barcode flag, the European Commission-led contest for the creation of a logo for the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, and visual materials used in the public communication of a number of cities participating in the annual European Capital of Culture competition. Specifically, the goal of this analysis is to describe and critically engage the main semiotic strategies resources used across these examples to brand EU identity as culturally diverse and, conversely, to exploit cultural diversity as a visual identity resource. In doing this, this paper also aims to highlight the unique role and potential of visual symbolic production in the construction and performance of transnational identities."
2008-1315,"The Archies, the Synthespian, and the Profitable Evacuation of Performer Agency",The Changing Spaces of Popular Media Production: Transformations and Trajectories,,,,Paper,"The Archies, the Synthespian, and the Profitable Evacuation of Performer Agency",The Changing Spaces of Popular Media Production: Transformations and Trajectories,"The synthespian combines human performance and digital animation, allowing the creation of astonishing characters like Lord of the Rings Gollum. Such characters, as Tom Gunning (2006) writes, advance our ability to create a moving human simulacrum, an impulse that predates the advent of motion pictures by centuries. But while that impulse may be a longstanding one, its meaning changes in different political-economic conditions. Recent labor struggles around the growing use in Hollywood of the motion capture video technology necessary to the production of the synthespian, this paper argues, are uniquely illuminated through analysis of the ensemble of labor relations at work in The Archies, a late 1960s childrens cartoon series.

In many ways The Archies is simply another example of the ability to hide labor behind animation. When looked at in the context of the specific political-economic problems to which the program constituted a solution, however, another dimension of synthespianism becomes apparent. To the characters of The Archies were attached the voices and musicianship of highly skilled musical performers; these characters were an enormously popular band  responsible for numerous chart-topping hits  who were utterly devoid of agency and thus utterly controllable, fixed capital.

Drawing on historical research, interviews with The Archies producers and contemporary accounts of Hollywood labor struggles, this paper argues that such exciting new technological and artistic developments must also be understood in their impacts on the terrain of political economic contests characteristic of the relations of media production."
2008-1316,The Association Between Satisfaction and Commitment Differs Across Marital Couple Types,terpersonal Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Association Between Satisfaction and Commitment Differs Across Marital Couple Types,Interpersonal Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"Prior research has shown that there are distinctly different types of marriages that naturally occur in the population and that are classifiable based on their ideology, autonomy/interdependence, and communication styles. The marriages were predicted to differ in marital satisfaction and commitment. Interdependence theory further predicts that satisfaction is a key determinant of commitment. Because some marriages are defined in part by a traditional ideology that anchors commitment in a value system rather than inherent rewards of the relationship, the association between satisfaction and commitment was expected to vary by couple type. Participants were 208 married couples from 20 different states in the USA. They completed self-report measures of relational ideology, autonomy, communication, satisfaction, and commitment. Results indicated that traditional and mixed couples had higher relationship satisfaction than separate couples. Traditional couples also had the highest dedication commitment and separates had the lowest dedication commitment. Finally, actor-partner interdependence models used to test the association between satisfaction and commitment revealed no significant effects for traditional couples, but strong and significant positive associations for separate couples. These findings suggest that there are different determinants of commitment in different types of marriages."

My analysis focuses on the triennial transnational forum hosted by the Association for Womens Rights in Development (AWID) and held in Bangkok, Thailand in October 2005. AWID is a transnational membership association concerned with womens rights and global justice. The AWID forum, as a site wherein transnational alliances are formed and strengthened is situated within the contemporary context and experience of globalization. Given the new problematics posed by globalization, in this study I address the ways in which notions and expressions of culture and communication can be reconceptualized to better account for the cultural dimensions of globalization. Specifically, I highlight the ways in which the spatial dimensions of culture (for example, local or global) are conceptualized and reified. I pay particular attention to the points of connection and disconnection between bodies and the temporary space of collective action. In so doing, I begin to map out the trajectories that subjects take up in order to join a diverse, global collective."

He spoke of the need to move on from a culture of announcement to one of dialogue and debate, to become more radar and less loudhailer. The declared shift from the heavy, and many critics would argue excessive, emphasis on presentation in the first years of Blairs prime ministership (see Barnett and Gaber, 2001; Pitcher, 2003 and Franklin, 2004), appeared to be a tacit acceptance that the approach to government communication epitomised by Alastair Campbell, former Press Secretary to the Prime Minister, had serious flaws.
This paper examines key moments in the development of government communication in the Blair years (1997-2007) and the critical academic and journalistic response to them. It explores what lessons, if any, can be learnt for government communication."
2008-1319,"The Broadcaster, Media Reform Movement: This is Then and That was Now",A Century of Struggle: The Tug of War Between Social Activism and Corporate Public Relations,,,,Paper,"The Broadcaster, Media Reform Movement: This is Then and That was Now",A Century of Struggle: The Tug of War Between Social Activism and Corporate Public Relations,"In the early 1930s a feisty and heterogeneous broadcast reform movement challenged the emerging hegemony of commercial radio broadcasting and its two dominant networks, NBC and CBS. This movement made a strong critique of the limitations of commercial media for a free and self-governing society and attempted to pass legislation establishing a vibrant noncommercial broadcasting sector. In this contest the reformers went up against corporate media lobbying power and the emergence of highly sophisticated public relations. The movement was flustered by the PR and overwhelmed by the corporate lobby. It collapsed with the passage of the Communications Act of 1934.

In the past five years there has emerged a modern media reform movement that is attempting to do similar work as the 1930s broadcast reform movement, only extended to media writ large. This movement has successfully organized literally millions of Americans on issues ranging from media ownership and public broadcasting to stopping government propaganda efforts, hypercommercialism and keeping the Internet from being privatized. What is striking about the new media reform movement is how it has consciously learned from the experiences of the 1930s, in particular in addressing the corporate lobbying and PR juggernaut. This paper will draw out these connections."

The argument employs Jurgen Habermass Discourse Ethics. The paper analyzes discourse ethics in contrast to natural law ethics. For purposes of illustration the discourse ethics are used in an analysis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in an examination of debates over Confucian based criticisms of universal rights regimes.

Two hundred thirty-two (232) female college students enrolled in a major university completed the self-administered questionnaire. The structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that (1) the likelihood that respondents felt dissatisfied with their bodies increased with BMI; (2) criticism by others was a positive predictor of body dissatisfaction; (3) upwards social comparisons positively predicted body dissatisfaction; and (4) body dissatisfaction markedly influenced respondent weight-loss intention.
2008-1322,The Challenging Potential of Local Media: Lessons From China,vestigations of Chinese Media,,,,Paper,The Challenging Potential of Local Media: Lessons From China,Investigations of Chinese Media,"Instead of conventional conceptualisation of local as a unified national in the discussion of globalization in media study, this paper reveals a decentralised administrative and TV system in China, and further identifies a national-local level of analysis. This research has found that in order to fulfil its political imperatives, the Chinese national government has made a deal with the global media at the expanse of the local TV broadcasters economic interests. This national-local tension has pressed the local television organizations to request for more autonomy, protections and preferential policies and has also pushed the national government to improve the transparency and the quality of its broadcasting policies and policymaking process. On the other hand, the interest disjunction between the national and the local has also resulted in two conflicting stands towards foreign media. This local-national relation has been and will continue to be, one of the most profound dynamics that drive future changes in the television system in China. The findings of the dynamic national-local relationship provide another theoretical approach to understanding of the media in China. More generally, it invites the reconsidering of the existing national-global analytical framework in international communication research. In other words, more than asking how local is local in the global-local nexus, what we need to reconsider, as Chinas case indicates, is the more complex interactive relations among the global, national and different locals: a local-national-global analytical approach."

From 1921 to 1966 only a few womens magazines were available in China and all were owned and published by the government. China protected its local magazine industry until the late 1980s, and since then a there has been a proliferation of womens magazines  both local and international. Today, Chinese language versions of Western womens magazines, such as Elle, Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Harpers Bazaar, can be found on the magazine racks of any major city in China. This increase in foreign titles has been met by a flood of local magazines as well as Japanese magazines, so that all together there are somewhere between 80 to 90 womens magazines currently available in China. This preliminary study uses historical analysis and political economy to examine the growth of womens magazines in China and through this case study aims to shed light on some of the trends in publishing to women in the Asian region."

More precisely, it looks at the top news selected by journalists on four Web sites on the hard-soft content dimension and determines whether there is a gap between these choices and the top ones made by the consumers of these sites. It does so by adopting an approach that helps to overcome three shortcomings of most existing scholarship on these topics: it takes the story as the unit of analysis, distinguishes between softening in terms of what stories are told and how they are told, and tries to disentangle the influence of journalists and consumers choices on each other. The analysis shows that (a) journalists supply of news is markedly soft in terms of what stories are told but hard regarding how they are told; (b) there is a gap between journalists and consumers choices that is a uniform and relatively strong in terms of what news are covered but localized and comparatively weaker regarding how they are reported; and (c) the approach adopted contributes granularity, precision, and heuristic power to the inquiry."

We recruited 26 professional medical interpreters from 17 languages and 32 health care providers from 4 specialties to participate in in-depth interviews and focus groups. Our findings suggest that no one has the sole authorship to his or her own voice in interpreter-mediated encounter. The providers (and the patients) voice is mediated through the interpreters performance (or voice). The interpreters voice remains hidden while being constantly monitored, supervised, and rectified by the provider. In addition, the once integrated voice diverged into multiple voices. Individuals differentiate their understanding of and response to (a) meanings across various semiotic resources, and (b) functions of the provider-patient conversations. As a result, the integrated, singular voice is perceived and treated with multiple authors and purposes, each with its corresponding expertise and authorities in legitimizing the voice(s)."

This phenomenon has referred to as the Korean Wave, surging a boom of Korean pop culture in the region.

I claim that this peculiar nationalism has actively forced by the extreme capitalist market-orientation regarding Koreas global expansionism."
2008-1327,The Communication Structure of Recovery: Post-Katrina New Orleans Interorganizational Networks,Top Three Papers in Organizational Communication,,,,Paper,The Communication Structure of Recovery: Post-Katrina New Orleans Interorganizational Networks,Top Three Papers in Organizational Communication,"Although the majority of disaster studies examine the individual as the social unit of interest, this study?s focus is on organization-level activity with a particular interest on the role of interorganizational networks in disaster recovery. We examine how communication relationships foster recovery and rebuilding of interorganizational networks in New Orleans following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. Data are from field research and in depth interviews made with organizational and business leaders who returned and were actively engaged in rebuilding. Findings suggest a communication-centered interorganizational theory of disaster recovery. The social structure of post disaster is marked by an organizational ?kinship? network of strong and weak micro and macro level ties of support. Having had communication with alters and being available through professional networks also put organizations in a place where they could ?cash in? on previously networked social capital as well as create new relationships in their rebuilding efforts."

Specifically, this study investigates ways in which the organizational leaders communicative behaviors and messages, as well as the relationship between leaders and organizational members play a role in the identification process of the members. Using a case study approach, a planned change in organizational leadership was observed in a local chapter of a sorority. Semi-structured-interviews, questionnaires given at two points in time, and observations of chapter functions were used to understand the ways in which identification was influenced by a change in leadership. The study establishes a link between leadership change and member identification with the organization. The findings of this study offer an integrated model of leadership in which the communicative is foregrounded. The findings of this study point to the need for the continued integration of methods and theories while studying organizational phenomena and the testing of the model of leadership that is proposed herein."

By focusing on labor structure and labor size, this paper argues that 1) the FDI-driven and export-dependent mode of ICT development does not provide a sufficient solution to Chinas employment issue, because even though job creation in non-state sectors of economy has outpaced job reduction in state sector, most of the newly created jobs are highly-exploitative, dead-end and irregular jobs, which would cause long-term problems including labor oppositions and societal inability of labor reproduction; 2) the labor structure defined by the dynamics of global integration and transnational corporation dominated production indicates that Chinas ICT sector is trapped in the low end of the industrial production chain."
2008-1330,The Concept of Visual Competence as Seen From the Perspective of the Psychological and Brain Sciences,Visual Competence: A New Paradigm?,,,,Paper,The Concept of Visual Competence as Seen From the Perspective of the Psychological and Brain Sciences,Visual Competence: A New Paradigm?,"Visual competence in its most basic form relates to fundamental processes of visual perception. The analysis of neuropsychological impairments and recent advances in the brain sciences have led to considerable changes in how vision is conceived. Research spans from investigations of the visual pathway, subcortical and cortical areas in the brain that process different visual information (e.g., faces, objects, motion) and how vision is altered when relevant structures are damaged as well as studying the interaction between vision and other modalities such as sound and touch and their integration. The existence of different visual pathways (ventral and dorsal pathway) and of mirror neurons in the brain suggests a strong coupling between perception and action. Studies in psychology have shown that visual attention and perception are influenced by properties of the visual stimuli as well as by goals of the observers and their personal experience. We argue that applied concepts of visual competence will benefit from considering research in the psychological and brain sciences."

Since the advent of the Internet they no longer have to rely on annual reports and media coverage to gain visibility among audiences outside the organization. This study integrates analyses of content, discourse, and visuals to examine how corporations exploit corporate websites to communicate favorable CEO identities. The study reveals that CEO profiles on corporate websites express both professional and private CEO identities. Discourse elements constructive of favorable CEO identities include positive self-disclosure, reference to prestige-laden concepts, and the implicit or explicit attribution of corporate outcomes to the CEO. In addition, CEO profiles convey cues about the formal and informal networks in which the CEOs operate by revealing their affiliations with universities, professional associations and philanthropic organizations. Visual cues were found to play an insignificant role in CEO portrayal on corporate websites."
2008-1333,The Contemporary Media Environment and Breadth of Communication: The Contribution of the Internet to the Heterogeneity of Political Discussion Networks,cholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Contemporary Media Environment and Breadth of Communication: The Contribution of the Internet to the Heterogeneity of Political Discussion Networks,Scholar to Scholar: Political Communication Interactive Paper Poster Session,"The increasing presence of the Internet across the spectrum of political communication has fed debates about media use, political discussion, and exposure to political difference. This study explores the intersection of these topics through a focus on the heterogeneity of peoples political discussion networks. It is addressed to the question of how Internet use affects peoples overall exposure to political difference, either by providing the means for high selectivity in online discussion partners, which could affect overall experiences with political difference, or by weakening various social boundaries, which could potentially broaden the heterogeneity of peoples political discussion networks. Through the use of nationally representative survey data, the current study therefore develops and tests an integrated regression model of political discussion network heterogeneity, bringing the face-to-face and online worlds together. The results suggest that beyond the influence of face-to-face mechanisms, online political discussion (directly) and online hard news (both directly and indirectly) contribute to the overall heterogeneity of political discussion networks and that the variables predicting frequency of political discussion at online and offline forums differ in theoretically meaningful ways."
2008-1334,"The Contribution of Different Socializing Agents to Emerging Adults' Sexuality: The Role of Parents, Best Friends, Romantic Partners, and Television Personalities",Accomodation and Attraction,,,,Paper,"The Contribution of Different Socializing Agents to Emerging Adults' Sexuality: The Role of Parents, Best Friends, Romantic Partners, and Television Personalities",Accomodation and Attraction,"To explore the role different socializing agents play in emerging adults sexual socialization, 298 participants (ages 18 to 24) completed self-report questionnaires assessing their perceptions of four socializing agents (a close friend, a romantic partner, a parent, and a favorite television character) sexual attitudes and behaviors as well as their communication with each of these agents about sex. These perceptions were assessed in relation to participants own sexual attitudes, behaviors, and perceived risks associated with sex to understand the role of each socializing agent in individuals sexual socialization. The results suggest that friends and romantic partners sexual attitudes and behaviors were the strongest predictors of participants own sexual socialization, particularly regarding sexual behaviors. However, parents attitudes about sex were also significantly and positively related to participants attitudes and behaviors even after accounting for the other socializing agents. In addition, perceptions of television characters sexual behaviors played the largest role in participants perceived risks associated with sex."
2008-1335,The Costs and Benefits of Separating Wireless Telephone Service From Handset Sales and Imposing Network Neutrality Obligations,ternational Convergence Policies,,,,Paper,The Costs and Benefits of Separating Wireless Telephone Service From Handset Sales and Imposing Network Neutrality Obligations,International Convergence Policies,"Wireless operators in the United States qualify for streamlined regulation when providing telecommunications services and even less government oversight when providing information services, entertainment and electronic publishing. As wireless ventures plan and install next generation networks, these carriers expect to offer a diverse array of services, including Internet access, free from common carrier regulatory responsibilities that nominally still apply to telecommunications services. Wireless carrier managers reject the need for governments to ensure consumers safeguards such as nondiscriminatory access and separating the sale of radiotelephone handsets from carrier services.

This paper will examine the costs and benefits of government-imposed wireless network neutrality rules with an eye toward examining the lawfulness and need for such safeguards. The paper will consider the difference between wireless network neutrality and an earlier debate about neutral Internet access via wired networks. Because wireless carriers package subsidized handset sales often with a blend of telecommunications and information services and consumers welcome the opportunity to use and replace increasingly sophisticated handsets, regulators have refrained from ordering handset unbundling. But for other services, such as cable television, the FCC has pursued public safeguards that attempt to allow consumers the opportunity to access only desired content using least cost equipment options.

The paper concludes that the rising importance of wireless networking for most ICE services and growing consumer disenchantment with carrier-imposed restrictions on handset versatility and wireless network access will trigger closer regulatory scrutiny of the public interest benefits accruing from wireless network neutrality."
2008-1336,The Cultural Embedding and Disembedding of Political Elite Networks,Reimagining Structure and Agency,,,,Paper,The Cultural Embedding and Disembedding of Political Elite Networks,Reimagining Structure and Agency,"This paper, drawing on a mixture of communication/cultural theory and economic sociology (Polanyi, Granovetter and Callon), engages with competing conceptions of cultural embedding and disembedding. It then explores the conditions under which elite networks become disembedded or disentangled from wider cultural and material relations. The concepts are then applied to political networks operating in and around the UK Parliament at Westminster. Findings build on recent interviews with 60 elected politicians including some 30 former government ministers and shadow ministers. Such interviews focused on the cultural practices, sources and uses of information, employed by politicians, as they made decisions and moved between constituency, parliamentary and government networks. It is argued that, there exist stark cultural and communicative differences between the various networks which, in turn, create layers of cultural embedding and disembedding in the political process. This encourages certain key discourses to come to dominate some networks while being strongly rejected by others. It also allows elite decision-making networks to become radically disentangled from wider social relations while, at the same time, strongly impacting upon those relations."
2008-1337,The Cycle of Concealment in Families and Strategies for Revealing Secrets,Top Four Papers In Interpersonal Communication,,,,Paper,The Cycle of Concealment in Families and Strategies for Revealing Secrets,Top Four Papers In Interpersonal Communication,"The purpose of this study was to uncover the strategies that individuals use to reveal their secrets to family members, how these strategies vary by the perceived aggressiveness of the family member, and to test a cycle of concealment in families. The results revealed six primary categories of strategies for revealing secrets: (1) preparation and rehearsal, (2) directness, (3) third party revelations, (4) incremental disclosures, (5) entrapment, and (6) indirect mediums (i.e., telephone, mail, email). People were more likely to use indirect strategies when they thought their family member would react negatively to their revelation. Unlike what was expected, however, not all indirect strategies were associated with the expectation that the respondent would react negatively to the revelation. In addition, people often used a combination of different strategies to reveal their secret to their family member. A family members verbally aggressive reactions to prior revelations strongly influenced the extent to which individuals thought that their family member would react negatively to the revelation of their current secret. The combination of past aggression and the expectation for negative reactions to the revelation of their secret also attenuated the closeness that the participants felt toward their family member. Finally, peoples expectations for negative reactions to the revelation of their secret and the extent to which those expectations were met or adversely violated after they revealed their secret influenced their closeness with the person and their willingness to reveal secrets to this person in the future."

The discourse of blame points to a problematic feature of current or future public relations practice. The essay illustrates several prominent ""dark visions"" or ""specters"" in public relations discourse. These fear appeals serve to criticize opponents' prescriptions for PR practice and to justify one's own program for public relations. Future research should explore how these dark visions wax and wane over time. Such work will enable us to map the cultural diversity in public relations discourse"

In a study examining the link between media exposure and HIV/AIDS related stigma, snowball sampling was undertaken of 18 to 25 year olds affiliated with Delhi-based HIV/AIDS-related non-governmental organizations as core staff, part-time staff, volunteers, and/or beneficiaries. The dendritic process of sampling, replete with unexpected key informant sourcing, respondent clustering, and rogue snowballs, revealed important strengths and weaknesses of this sampling technique in achieving its goals ­ some of which are unique to India, others with wider relevance. Furthermore, snowball variations at the level of the organization and the individual affect interpretations of research findings and require re-evaluation of case definitions. Finally, this study employs a technique traditionally used in qualitative research for quantitative data gathering, something that has increasingly emerged in HIV/AIDS related research and requires greater examination."

This paper explores the implications of Communication Infrastructure Theory for gay enclaves. In so doing, it reworks a theory that has been used to examine the relationship between public space, local media and civic engagement in immigrant communities in major urban areas to look at the relationship between public space, gay media, and the potential for gay civic engagement and deliberations over gay collective identity. Considerations of gay online communication, the decline of gay independent media, and identity performance are placed within a larger discussion of geographic space and community."

We propose that destructive communication consists of intentional or unintentional communication acts that are predominantly harmful to organizational members, groups within organizations, or organizations as a whole. Working from this definition, we examine the potentially destructive aspects of electronic technology use in organizations, by introducing five types of destructive activities. We elaborate on the various types of destructive communication behaviors within each category and, using an organizational case study, illustrate one example of how destructive communication acts may occur and discuss its consequences. We conclude by discussing processes for improving technology use within organizations and by offering suggestions on how to limit and prevent destructive communicative practices."

However, recent studies have focused on the distinctive characteristics of the advice (see Goldsmith, 2004). This study seeks to understand, not the benefits of support, but the actual goals that people have when they ask others for that advice. Study 1 (n = 45) was designed to explore what kind of expectations advice recipients have and as a result, five expectation categories were identified: emotional support, directives, outsiders perspective, agreement, and venting. These findings indicate that advice recipients sometimes do expect emotional support even when they seek advice, and often they do just want concrete information, like directives. Study 2 (n = 131) classified expectation units using the definition of each category drawn from study 1 and found the expectation types that advice recipients had, including care-giving type, action-facilitating type, and mixed type."
2008-1343,The Development and Testing of the Instructional Interaction Theory,tructional Communication: Advances in Theory and Practice,,,,Paper,The Development and Testing of the Instructional Interaction Theory,Instructional Communication: Advances in Theory and Practice,"Instructional researchers have been concern over the lack of instructional communication theories for at least the past 40 years. However, the voices expressing these concerns seem to have grown louder and more impatient as of late (Mottet, Frymier, & Beebe, 2006; Nussbaum, & Friedrich, 2005; Simonds, 2001; Waldeck, Kearney, & Plax, 2001). This manuscript introduces a new theory of instructional communication, termed the Instructional Interaction Theory. Furthermore, two empirical investigations are presented in an attempt to validate this new theory. The theories relationship to the long and rich history of instructional research is discussed as well as the implications of the current data. Finally, suggestions for future research in order to further validate the theory are discussed."

The modification of computer games by users is called modding and has a long tradition in the games community. It also influences the games industry in various ways. Nevertheless, modding has received limited scientific attention so far. An online survey among 194 German modders, game players who engage in modding, was conducted to addresses this paucity of research. Based on their usage patterns of modding technology, four distinct types of modders were identified. These modder types were characterized with regard to their motivation to engage in modding, their communication behavior, perceived social norms, and restrictions."
2008-1345,"The Dialectics of Immigration Debate: A Historical Perspective of Public Discourse Framing in Hazleton, PA",From Science to Society: Discourses of Difference,,,,Paper,"The Dialectics of Immigration Debate: A Historical Perspective of Public Discourse Framing in Hazleton, PA",From Science to Society: Discourses of Difference,"Recent developments put the obscure U.S. city of Hazleton, PA on the map of the global immigration debate. Confronted by a fast-growing Spanish-speaking immigrant populace, its council passed controversial ordinances in 2006 which attempted to regulate immigration at the local level. Yet immigration is not a new topic in Hazleton. In its 150-year history, the city has gone through two previous immigration cycles when first German and Irish, and after 1880 Eastern and Southern European immigrants settled in the region and had to negotiate their place in the mainstream U.S. society. While most of the existing media research conceives immigration debate as a static thing, this study analyzes its local newspaper-coverage as it evolved during a relatively long period of second immigration wave (1880-1924). It conceptualizes the immigration debate as a dialectic process and consequently focuses on the mechanism through which the social system of capitalist production survives, absorbs its own contradictions and reproduces its social relations in spite of the doomsday scenarios of classical Marxist scholars. In the conclusion, the dynamics of historical debate are compared with the issues emerging during the current, still open immigration cycle. The authors believe that while the past is not able to predict the future, it holds the key to our ability to understand the dynamics of current immigration trends with their latent potential to also shape tomorrow."
2008-1346,The Disappearing Act: Public Relations Consultancy in Theory and Research,Top Papers in Public Relations,,,,Paper,The Disappearing Act: Public Relations Consultancy in Theory and Research,Top Papers in Public Relations,"This paper concerns itself with the relative invisibility of the public relations consultancy, or agency, in academic research and theory building; and consequently with the implications this surprising lack of interest has in terms of the ways in which public relations is understood through extant theories. In conceptual terms, the paper draws on literature devoted to business service/professional organizations and more specifically to management consultancy focusing on similarities with public relations in terms of development trends, and industry structures. The empirical material presented here is a case study of the UK consultancy industry in the years 1995-2000. The paper argues that taking a long-term view of public relations consultancy makes it possible to qualify or correct some of the views about the practice articulated by its critics. The main findings of the analysis can be summarised by a number of keywords: consolidation, globalisation, and diversiﬁcation."
2008-1347,The Discipline of Communication in US and Russia: Field Notes,The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,,,,Paper,The Discipline of Communication in US and Russia: Field Notes,The Study of Communication in Russia: State and Perspectives,"Until quite recently, the discipline of communication studies has been developed from the singular perspective of the United States (Monge, 1998: 4). In many countries the views of communication remain largely American views, but without adding the adjective American before views of communication (Jia et al., 2002: xv); as a result, they misleadingly suggest that these views are universal (Jia et al., 2002: xv). However, culture-centered views of communication are being introduced into the field of communication studies, adding to the diversity of the field, cf. such books as Non-Western Perspectives on Human Communication: Implications for Theory and Practice (Kim, 2002), Chinese Communication Theory and Research: Reflections, New Frontiers, and New Directions (Jia et al., 2002), Action Theory and Communication Research: Recent Developments in Europe (Renckstorf et al., 2004). It is crucial that we learn and understand what new insights might be brought into conceptualizations of communication as an object of study and teaching.
In my presentation I will compare the intellectual traditions that impact the discipline of communication as conceptualized in the U.S. and Russia. I will discuss the main theories that might form the foundational framework for the communication discipline in both countries. I will address the concept of academic authority as developed in both countries. I will look at how communication curricula are structured and what sources are used as textbooks. Finally, I will discuss recent attempts to stimulate an intercultural dialogue between U.S. and Russian communication scholars."
2008-1348,"The Discreet Charm of the Petite Celebrity: Gender and Lifestyle on ""My Super Sweet 16""","Girls, Children, and Media Power",,,,Paper,"The Discreet Charm of the Petite Celebrity: Gender and Lifestyle on ""My Super Sweet 16""","Girls, Children, and Media Power","The mediated consumer culture represented in MTVs My Super Sweet 16 articulates a new life stylization that can best be explained as petite celebrity. This paper maps out a new path into celebrity that derives from media and consumer culture where individuals attempt to transform economic capital into the cultural capital and status of celebrity. In the attempts to become celebrities, the texts of the program symbolically place the participants into a petite position. The shows main participants, mostly teenage girls, reveal through their practices and discourses that petite celebrity relies heavily on gender and codes of femininity for its distinction. The purpose of this research is to examine why this new life stylization relies so heavily on codes of gender for its expression, and what these gendered codes of petite celebrity constituted by the show reveal about broader U.S. consumer and popular culture. I argue that consumption provides the constitutive link between gender performativity and the petite celebrity lifestyle represented in mediated rituals displayed on My Super Sweet 16. A textual analysis of the first season is informed by critical theories of media ritual, feminism and consumption."
2008-1349,The Discursive Practices of Media Convergence: When Old Media Meets New Media,Digital News,,,,Paper,The Discursive Practices of Media Convergence: When Old Media Meets New Media,Digital News,"This research examines the way traditional media reacted to new media between 1988 and 1995 through discourse analysis of nine major metropolitan newspapers. Content analysis within a metaphorical framework is applied to a data set that includes 900 articles from eight different newspapers. The paper argues that as old and new media converge, old media has to renegotiate its place within a structural and pedagogical framework. Historically, newspapers have been reactive to other forms of media and the internet was no exception. The volatile relationship between old and new media appears consistently within the discourse surrounding the internet contained in old media such as newspapers. This research hopes to provide a better understanding of how old and new media negotiate journalistic tendencies while maintaining separate identities."
2008-1350,The Discursive Styles of Chinese Malaysians Everyday Talk About Dissatisfaction,Message Styles in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,The Discursive Styles of Chinese Malaysians Everyday Talk About Dissatisfaction,Message Styles in Intercultural Communication,"This study sought to provide an emic understanding of the discursive styles for expressing dissatisfaction as everyday talk among interlocutors in a Chinese Malaysian community. Expressions of dissatisfaction focused on mundane instances in which others offended interlocutors. Such discourse was treated as so-called dark side of communication in which harmonious interaction is not ensured. The study revealed two discursive styles of expressing dissatisfaction: (a) the assertion-defense style, in which the victim-of-offense alerted the offender about the latters errant behavior and sought a satisfactory solution, despite the offenders denial of the offence; and (b) the diversion-hint style, in which the victim made veiled insinuations, only hinting at the problem and not stating it directly, but still expected the offender to rectify the problem. In the first instance, community members rationalized that they needed to protect their self-image and to minimize the feelings associated with dissatisfaction. They justified the second style on the need to protect themselves from possible negative consequences resulting from a face-to-face complaint, such as being sidelined by a boss or an escalation of the incident. Theoretical contributions of the study are discussed in comparison with other Asian and Chinese communication studies."
2008-1351,"The Disenchanted Voter: Emotional Appeals, Class Polarization, and Voter Turnout in Mexico",Voting and Deliberation,,,,Paper,"The Disenchanted Voter: Emotional Appeals, Class Polarization, and Voter Turnout in Mexico",Voting and Deliberation,"This paper uses qualitative research methods to explain how audience readings of polarizing campaign messages created a situation in which a political candidate came to embody mobilizing emotions in certain disenchanted voters that overcame a macro-level trend away from electoral participation. This was because audience interpretations of campaign messages in Mexico?s 2006 presidential election produced very different but equally mobilizing emotional responses depending upon an audience member?s class status: fear of change for the wealthy, and hope for change in the poor. These findings are relevant for understanding the micro-level decision making processes that can turn disenchantment into turnout or abstention. In the broader sense, they imply that there is no necessary relationship between disenchantment with politics, politicians, or the performance of political institutions and the decision whether or not to vote. In a specific way, these findings suggest that viable and polarizing candidates who credibly embody a political discourse that provokes strong emotions may be able to mobilize participation among certain social sectors despite their unhappiness with politics and government outcomes. However, given that polarizing political discourse did not stall the trend nationally towards greater abstention from electoral politics, there is no reason to assume from this study that polarization is the answer to declining turnout in Mexico or other new democracies facing similar circumstances. We recommend instead greater attention to the underlying cause of disenchantment ? poor governmental performance."

Integrating Competing Concepts to Explain News Processing,,,,Paper,The downfall of narrativity and news values in the new media environment,News Between Narrativity and News Value. Integrating Competing Concepts to Explain News Processing,"This study traces the downfall of narrativity and hierarchical news value, through the study of international news coverage, in a variety of genres, of three major news events: September 11th, the outbreak of Gulf War II, and the Israel-Hezbollah war.

Traditional broadcast news was based on coherent news stories, told after the fact, following the strict professional practices of cross-checking, editing, and hierarchically ordering items, according to their perceived news value and tailored to studio anchors (see Schudson, Carey, Raymond Williams). Since the mid 90s, we are witness to a gradual transformation of both narrativity and the standards of news value, and, with it, of the concept of news as we knew it.

The development of new media technologies has made possible real-time transmission of live news from a global field, via the studio, to homes. With all-news channels broadcasting round the clock, and the changing habits of news viewers that followed, narrativity and traditional hierarchies of news value have been molested. Viewers are now subject to open-ended live broadcasts of natural or man-made disasters from anywhere in the world, in which editors and anchors are no longer in control of the script. They are as ignorant as their audiences of the story behind the open-ended, often arbitrary and irrelevant, scenes they are fed live, endlessly surveying. Strict editing has given way to speculation and endless repetition, dictated by the live broadcast. Ironically, competition enforces almost total sameness among the multiplicity of channels. Good old narrativity and hierarchical assignment of news value have been relegated to a variety of genres, such as political talks shows, investigative documentaries, and other quazzi-news genres (Ellis)."

While this conversion has resulted in exceptional economic growth and increased prosperity for Chinas people, it also created challenges to Chinas communist policies. Almost three decades later, these challenges persist in the form of a tension between open economic growth and a closed political system. Such tension is most visibly manifested in the medium of the Internet, where the free market system and freedom of expression combine and, sometimes, collide.
Chinas government has labored to keep the Internet open for business but closed to threatening political ideas and discussions. But Chinas attempts to keep a lid on the Internet also prevent many western Internet companies from providing their services to Chinese citizens. The interference with western nations businesses amounts to a form of trade barrier, and violates Chinas free trade obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under WTO rules, such trade barriers may be challenged by other member nations through the WTO dispute settlement body. If Chinas Internet actions and policies were determined to be violations by the WTO dispute settlement body, western nations could impose countervailing sanctions against China. This settlement process could create an effective method for western nations to push China toward a freer Internet and a more open society."

We find strongly positive statistical relationships between the size of foreign language populations in the radio market and the amount of radio programming in their respective language that is available. We also find a preference externality effect: consistently negative relationships between the amount of foreign language programming available and size of the English language population. Generally, foreign language programming availability increases at a decreasing rate as foreign language populations grow. We find similar results for another measure of radio programming variety, the number of foreign language formats per market, and for a measure of programming quality, the percentage of news/talk programming that is locally produced."

Using Banduras (1997) theory of self-efficacy as a guide, this project examined the implementation of a teacher training program for GTAs and assessed its outcomes. Our results revealed that after receiving training, GTAs reported that they were more likely to choose prosocial behavioral alternation techniques to manage students. They also reported significantly higher self-efficacy across three instructional areas: classroom management, promoting student involvement, and using instructional strategies. Finally, GTAs also expressed a belief that they could count on more supervisor support than they believed they had pre-training. Only the perceptions of peer support remained unchanged. Overall, the findings reflect a positive effect of training on GTAs feelings of competence in handling the challenges of their positions and offer several suggestions in terms of design, implementation, and assessment of teacher training programs."
2008-1356,The Effect of Image Features on the Activation of Archetypes,Visual Communication Top Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Effect of Image Features on the Activation of Archetypes,Visual Communication Top Paper Session,"Viewers (N = 312) were randomly assigned to rate one of three sets of 10 symbolic images (M = 30) on 57 evaluative items. A 2-step model was proposed based on information processing theory and emotional sequences of stimulus evaluation. In the model, exposure to image features influences orienting and attention processes, and then attention processes influence the structure of memory. Using exploratory then confirmatory factor analysis, responses to the evaluative items were reduced to eight archetypes, a factor-structure that replicated across the three sets of images. Archetypal clarity was measured as the average correlation among the items measuring an archetype. A cluster analysis of images identified five dimensions on which viewers perceived image features. A causal model was constructed that tracked the effect of image features on archetypal clarity. Some image features lowered the threshold for activation of archetypes whereas other image features raised the threshold for activation of archetypes. Analysis of the residuals indicated two latent continua on which archetypes varied  an approach-avoid self dimension and an approach-avoid other dimension."

The current paper examines two aspects of VR which uniquely contribute to media interactivity: the ability to capture and review physical behavior and the ability to see ones avatar rendered in real-time from third person points of view. In two studies, we utilized a state of the art, image-based tele-immersive system which is capable of tracking and rendering many degrees of freedom of human motion in real-time. In Experiment One, participants learned better in VR than in a video learning condition according to self-report measures, and the cause of the advantage was seeing ones avatar stereoscopically in the third person. In Experiment Two, we added a virtual mirror in the learning environment to further leverage the ability to see oneself from novel angles in real-time. Participants learned better in VR than in video according to objective performance measures. Implications for learning via interactive digital media are discussed."

However, only a few studies cursorily analyze the effects of this co-orientation behavior on the content of media products. We use data from a content analysis of two national and two regional German newspapers and different methods of time series analysis linear models and artificial neural networks to assess the co-orientation relationships between these newspapers. For one of the two regional newspapers, the intensity of coverage of a political issue is better predicted when using linear time series models that include data on the national newspapers instead of univariate models. This may be interpreted as an effect of co-orientation. Using neural networks, the results are similar, but the explanatory power of the models is higher. We conclude that co-orientation is best modeled by using non-linear functions as implemented e.g. in neural networks."
2008-1359,"The Effect of Loneliness on Internet Use Motivation, Internet Use, and Cross-Cultural Adaptation Among Chinese Students in the U.S.",Chinese Perspectives in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,"The Effect of Loneliness on Internet Use Motivation, Internet Use, and Cross-Cultural Adaptation Among Chinese Students in the U.S.",Chinese Perspectives in Intercultural Communication,"Guided by uses and gratifications theory and prior research on cross-cultural adaptation (CCA), this paper investigates how loneliness influenced Chinese students Internet use and CCA. The results show that chronically lonely, situationally lonely and non-lonely groups were significantly different in their motives for Internet use. Non-lonely Chinese students were more likely to use the Internet for acculturation and less likely for passing time and companionship than did chronically lonely Chinese students. Moreover, loneliness is a significant negative predictor of both sociocultural adaptation and psychological adaptation. The findings support the uses and gratifications paradigm which posits that individual differences influence peoples motivation for media use and past CCA research. Implications of the results for uses and gratifications and CCA research are discussed."

It reviews the literatures involving the use of media technology in virtual collaboration, the impact of cultural diversity on collaboration, and how modality interact with cultural perceptive to influence collaboration. In a lab experiment, 20 American and 20 Chinese students formed 20 cross-cultural dyads to perform two survival tasks by using the audio and the text chatting functions of Google Talk separately. The result of the study found that participants experienced less communication difficulties, perceived more cultural difference between self and partner in trustworthiness, and found more language difference between self and partner in the audio condition than in the text condition. Compared to the text condition, participants had more overall satisfaction in the audio condition. However, the relationship between modality and overall satisfaction was partially mediated by perceived communication difficulties and perceived cultural difference in trustworthiness. Participants were also more satisfied with the collaboration in the audio condition than in the text condition. This relationship was partially mediated by perceived communication difficulties and perceived language difference. Participants had more satisfaction with result in the audio condition than in the text condition. This relationship was partially mediated by perceived communication difficulties and perceived cultural difference in trustworthiness."
2008-1361,The effect of online news attributes on its use and attachment levels: a theoretical and empirical investigation,Psychology of Technology Adoption,,,,Paper,The effect of online news attributes on its use and attachment levels: a theoretical and empirical investigation,Psychology of Technology Adoption,"This paper develops and tests a theoretical model of the online news adoption/use process, based on expectancy-value and innovation-diffusion theories, to examine the predictive power of nine common features of online news in its potential development. Using data from a national survey of online news uses in Australia, the study finds that while some online attributes such as its immediacy and content-richness features have a strong impact on the way online news is adopted, used and integrated into daily life, its unique attributes such as customisation and interactivity still have a limited effect. Also, despite that online news attributes tend to be integrated together in online news packages and thus can be unintentionally used without motivation, there is strong evidence to suggest that each of the nine online news features is substantially used because it is consciously appreciated and evaluated."
2008-1362,The Effect of Smoking Cues in Antismoking Public Service Announcements on Smoking Urge and Psychophysiological Reactions,High Density: Message Design Research,,,,Paper,The Effect of Smoking Cues in Antismoking Public Service Announcements on Smoking Urge and Psychophysiological Reactions,High Density: Message Design Research,"Prior studies have found that smoking-related cues are able to elicit smoking urge in addicted smokers. The current study represented the first cue-reactivity study in the context of antismoking PSAs. Using a two (no cue vs. smoking cue) by two (high vs. low argument strength) mixed design, this study tested the hypothesis that smoking-related cues presented in the context of antismoking public service announcements (PSAs) elicit smoking urges. The study tested 100 adult heavy smokers using both self-reported and psychophysiological measures of smoking urge. It also explored potential moderators during the urge elicitation. This study showed that smoking cues in antismoking PSAs elicited smoking urge in the weak argument condition. The effect was especially evident for male and highly dependent smokers. Limitations of the study and implications for future ad design were also discussed."
2008-1363,The Effect of Teacher Confirmation on Student Communication and Learning Outcomes.,Top Papers in Instructional & Developmental Communication,,,,Paper,The Effect of Teacher Confirmation on Student Communication and Learning Outcomes.,Top Papers in Instructional & Developmental Communication,"A live lecture experiment was conducted where teacher confirmation was manipulated (i.e., not confirming, somewhat confirming, confirming) across three college courses. After the lecture, students completed a post test assessing positive (i.e., student communication motives, student participation) and negative (i.e., challenge behaviors) communication behaviors they might engage in while taking a course with this instructor. Additionally, students reported on traditional learning outcomes (i.e., cognitive learning, affective learning, state motivation, student satisfaction) resulting from the lecture manipulation. Collectively, results indicated that teacher confirmation caused (a) more student communication for the relational, functional, and participatory motives and less communication for the excuse-making motive, (b) more student participation, (c) less challenge behavior, and (d) greater cognitive learning, affective learning, state motivation, and student satisfaction."
2008-1364,The Effect of Voice Agent Choice on Users Experiences in Business and Entertainment VUI Contexts,"Choice, Customization, and Control",,,,Paper,The Effect of Voice Agent Choice on Users Experiences in Business and Entertainment VUI Contexts,"Choice, Customization, and Control","Previous research has shown that system and voice features within voice user interfaces (VUIs) significantly affect task performance and user satisfaction. This present study is one of the first to examine how perceived control over such features affects performance and satisfaction in a VUI. In a 2 x 2 design, participants were either led to believe that they chose or were assigned to a voice agent (between participants). Participants then interacted with this agent in either a business or entertainment context (within participants). Choice of voice agent was found to reduce call duration and improve ratings of agent competency in the entertainment context, but had the opposite effects in the business context. These data demonstrate the importance of strategically enabling user control over the assignment of virtual agents depending on context."
2008-1365,The Effect Seekers: A Case Study on Hungarian Audiences Response to Excessively Partisan Media,Activating the Public Voice Through the Press and New Media,,,,Paper,The Effect Seekers: A Case Study on Hungarian Audiences Response to Excessively Partisan Media,Activating the Public Voice Through the Press and New Media,"In late modernity, media  audience encounters are becoming increasingly theater-like. A theatrical understanding of media reception is needed, as late modern political performance, highly dramatized and aesthetized, feeds reception practices which evoke the attendance of theater or music performances. Audiences who attend aesthetically intense performances (in theater or in popular media) selectively plounge into experiential spaces they do not have control over, willingly submit themselves to the performances power, in the quest of cathartic experience. Audiences of spectacular media are effect seekers. The concept of effect seeking expresses how the selective and active stance of media users may turn them into the object of media effects that surpass their intentional control. The above theoretical arguments have been applied to survey data about the effects of a highly spectacular political campaign in Hungary. During the 2002 electoral campaign, Hungarian citizens experienced the advent of a new era of mediatized, spectacular politics. The study presents empirical evidence about the uses and effects of highly partisan, expressive media programmes. From a dramaturgical angle, it will be argued that intensifying excess and partisanship in late modern popular television do not necessarily result in propagandistic effects, in tribal mobilization. At the same time, equally important is the fact that the selective and reflexive stance of the audience does not guarantee at all immunity from media effects."
2008-1366,The Effects of Coworker Relational Maintenance Strategies on Employee Outcomes,Constructing the Employee: Multiple Approaches to Workplace Communication,,,,Paper,The Effects of Coworker Relational Maintenance Strategies on Employee Outcomes,Constructing the Employee: Multiple Approaches to Workplace Communication,"Abstract

The current study was based on the assumption that coworker relationships are interpersonal in nature and therefore maintained through interpersonal communication. It examined coworker relational maintenance strategies and employee outcomes such as job satisfaction, communication satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work alienation. The study developed the Coworker Relational Maintenance Scale (CRMS) based on Stafford, Dainton, and Haas (2000) Relational Maintenance Scale. Analysis of responses from 276 fully-employed adults indicated that employees do use relational maintenance strategies when communicating with fellow coworkers, with the strategies of conflict management, shared tasks, and positivity as the strongest predictors of employee job satisfaction, communication satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work alienation. The study confirms that relational maintenance can be measured in organizations and reliably predicts important employee outcomes."
2008-1367,The Effects of Episodic and Thematic Framing Revisited: Exploring the Role of Attributional Styles,New Insights Into Framing Effect Processes,,,,Paper,The Effects of Episodic and Thematic Framing Revisited: Exploring the Role of Attributional Styles,New Insights Into Framing Effect Processes,"Previous framing effects research suggests that news frames have a quite powerful impact on attributional judgments. However, no studies to date have examined linkages between general attributional styles and the effects of news frames on attributions of responsibility. To fill this gap, this study takes an individual differences perspective in explaining framing effects. In an experiment manipulating episodic and thematic framing, the attributional styles attributional complexity and preference for external attributions are measured and treated as quasi-experimental factors. Beside a significant framing effect of thematic and episodic news stories, it was found that individuals with a general preference for dispositional attributions do also tend to blame the individual rather than external factors. Moreover, it could be shown that responsibility judgments of attributionally complex individuals tend to be broader than responsibility judgments of attributionally less complex individuals. The results are discussed in terms of the power and the limits of framing effects."
2008-1368,"*The Effects of Incongruity, Production, and Pacing on TV Advertisement (Top 4 Paper)",Advertising Structure and Effects,,,,Paper,"*The Effects of Incongruity, Production, and Pacing on TV Advertisement (Top 4 Paper)",Advertising Structure and Effects,"This study addresses an important area of research that has fascinated advertising professionals who are eager to make more attractive ads: understanding how the viewing audience perceives and processes television advertisements. Ad incongruity, the introduction of unexpected elements that are atypical of a given ad category, and production pacing were tested to explore the roles of these stimuli in capturing higher levels of arousal, which can produce both better evaluations and clearer memories of ads.
Sixty subjects, who were recruited from among undergraduate students at Cornell University and patrons of a local shopping mall, participated in an online experiment in which a set of TV ads was shown. Participants then answered questions immediately following exposure to the ads, providing data pertaining to ad evaluation, and memory. The ads themselves represented six different conditions: incongruent and slow paced, incongruent and medium paced, incongruent and fast paced, congruent and slow paced, congruent and medium paced, and congruent and fast paced.
The main findings involved Lang?s limited capacity model. It was found that the mental capacity or cognitive load required to process incongruent fasted-paced ads exceeded study participants? cognitive capacity to process the information in such ads. Participants? memory strength declined when exposed to both stimuli. Another key finding is that, as expected, incongruent ads were evaluated more positively, and better remembered than congruent ads. Production pacing also had some effect on participants. As pacing increased, people?s memory strength tended to increase as well, and ad evaluations tended to be more positive. However, ad type had
a significant influence on the processing of ads. Car ads were evaluated more positively, were more arousing, and were better remembered than over-the-counter drug ads. The study?s contributions include a key finding pertaining to incongruity effects that should help to resolve discrepancies in the literature on incongruity. The study also provided further confirmation of Lang?s (2000) limited capacity model."
2008-1369,The Effects of Instant Messaging on the Quality of Adolescents' Existing Friendships: A Longitudinal Study,Child and Adolescent Development in the Context of New Media Technologies,,,,Paper,The Effects of Instant Messaging on the Quality of Adolescents' Existing Friendships: A Longitudinal Study,Child and Adolescent Development in the Context of New Media Technologies,"Recent studies suggest that Instant Messaging (IM) is positively related to the quality of adolescents friendships. However, most of these studies were based on cross-sectional correlational data. In addition, most studies have focused on direct effects of IM on the quality of friendships without exploring mediating variables that may explain these effects. The aim of this study was to fill these two lacunae in the literature. We hypothesized that IM, which is mostly used to communicate with existing friends, stimulates the quality of friendships, via its potential to stimulate intimate online self-disclosure. A sample of 812 Dutch adolescents between 10 and 17 years of age were surveyed twice within a 6-month interval. IM had a positive longitudinal effect on the quality of adolescents existing friendships. This direct positive effect could be explained entirely by adolescents tendency to disclose intimate information online."

Results showed lower student perceptions of teacher credibility and teacher attraction for instructors on Facebook when compared to instructors not on Facebook.
2008-1371,The Effects of Journalist Opinionation on Learning From Television News,Political Knowledge,,,,Paper,The Effects of Journalist Opinionation on Learning From Television News,Political Knowledge,"Objective journalism has long come under fire from critics arguing that it fails to compel audiences and is often confusing in its unwillingness to take a stand, thereby inhibiting public knowledge about politics. New models of opinionated broadcast journalism, which have emerged on cable television in recent years, offer an alternative to objectivity ? albeit a controversial one ? that may be productive for political learning. This paper considers the possibility that opinionated television news ? that is, news in which the anchor or host expresses a clear political point of view ? promotes learning relative to traditional, objective news. An experiment was conducted in which subjects were randomly exposed to one of three news segments concerned with U.S. military involvement in Iraq: Two opinionated segments represented either a pro- or anti-war perspective, while the third segment relied upon a conventional, non-opinionated format. Results suggest that factual news recognition is enhanced in the presence of opinionation, though only among those who lack a partisan orientation toward the war issue. Opinionation was found to increase free recall of verbal information for partisans and non-partisans alike. Perceptions of bias appear to mediate the effects of opinionation on learning. The implications of these findings for democratic politics and journalistic practice are discussed."

What is the effect of the use of language X or language Y on the audience perceptions and opinions, when the content of the message is exactly the same? We consider language on itself to be a possible factor to influence credibility and perception of a news source (i.e. a person speaking on the news). We will test this with an elaborated experimental design. The stimulus was a constructed news item embedded in a longer and real excerpt of the flagship newscast from the public broadcaster in Belgium, Het Journaal, which is also the newscast with the highest viewer rates and highest degree of public trust."
2008-1373,The Effects of Political Knowledge on the Ability to Spot Manipulated Information in Print News Coverage of the 2004 Ukrainian Presidential Election,Political Knowledge,,,,Paper,The Effects of Political Knowledge on the Ability to Spot Manipulated Information in Print News Coverage of the 2004 Ukrainian Presidential Election,Political Knowledge,"This experiment explored whether levels of political knowledge influenced people?s ability to spot framed information about international affairs in print news coverage as well the susceptibility of their perceptions to influence by such information. The context of the study was the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. A convenience sample of 146 students at a large Western university were randomly assigned to read one of three simulated New York Times news articles, experimentally manipulated to favor the Ukrainian party in power, the opposition, or a balance of political viewpoints. Analysis revealed few significant relationships between levels of U.S. and international political knowledge and perceptions that the manipulated articles were biased. Rather, trust in the New York Times explained a majority of the variance in ability to spot manipulated information. However, analysis did reveal a significant negative association between U.S. political knowledge and media trust. In turn, significant positive relationships were observed between media trust, trust in the New York Times, and perceptions that biased articles were balanced and fair. The potential mediating effects of source credibility and trust on the relationship between political knowledge and susceptibility to influence by framed information in print news coverage warrants further investigation."
2008-1374,The Effects of Seeking and Scanning on Behavior:,canning and Seeking Cancer Information,,,,Paper,The Effects of Seeking and Scanning on Behavior:,Scanning and Seeking Cancer Information,"Previous studies have focused largely on information gained through intentional information seeking, virtually ignoring the information gained less purposively from the everyday media environment. Directly addressing this issue, this study investigated the association between information gained from the total media environment (i.e., seeking and scanning behaviors) and cancer preventive (exercise, diet, fruit and vegetable consumption) and screening intentions (PSA test, colonoscopy, mammogram) and subsequent behaviors. The study is based on a survey conducted among a national random digit dial-recruited panel of adults, ages 40-70 (N = 1,403). In order to understand how information gained from seeking and scanning influences cancer related intentions, we utilized the constructs proposed by the Integrative Model (IM). Our results showed that both seeking and scanning behaviors were associated with intention to perform each preventive or screening behavior. Furthermore, these relationships were mostly but not entirely mediated by attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control. Results also demonstrated mediation of the relationships between SSB and behavior through behavioral intentions. The implications of the findings for future research in this area were discussed."

The electromagnetic spectrum, recognized as the common property of humanity, presents us with a concrete and innovative foundation for the theorization and realization of communicative democracy. This paper explores the history of spectrum management and
regulatory processes from a democratic and radical perspective. Specifically, it examines spectrum management and community-based broadcast communications (community television, radio and wireless) in Argentina, Uruguay and Canadathree countries in the midst of radical socio-political change and markedly different points in the developmental process of communications policy making. What are the practical limits of democratic reform and how are they affected by political realities?"

This study takes a constitutive view of communication processes and focuses on how conflict emerges from disagreement space and gets socially constructed in the course of naturally-occurring interaction during mediation sessions.
2008-1377,The Emergence of User-Generated Media: Understanding Their Appeal From a Uses and Gratifications Perspective,Using User-Driven Technology,,,,Paper,The Emergence of User-Generated Media: Understanding Their Appeal From a Uses and Gratifications Perspective,Using User-Driven Technology,"User-generated media (UGM) such as YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, Flickr, and Wikipedia have attracted an extraordinary audience and are changing the traditional media landscape. This paper presents an analytical framework for understanding the appeal of UGM from a uses and gratifications perspective. It argues that individuals make use of UGM in different ways for different purposes: they consume user-generated contents for fulfilling their information, entertainment, and mood management needs; they participate through interacting with the content as well as with other users for enhancing social connections and virtual communities; and they produce their own contents for self-expression and self-actualization. Although the three UGM usages are analytically separate, in reality they are interdependent. This article proposes a model to describe such interdependence. Furthermore, this article argues that two usability aspects of UGM, easy to use and let users control, enable people to consume, participate, and/or produce very conveniently and efficiently so that people can derive greater gratification from their UGM use. Finally, this paper briefly discusses UGMs theoretical and practical implications."

We found evidence of the enduring influence of Confucianism in Chinese business, even though at times  such as that of last centurys Cultural Revolution  it was officially suppressed. While these findings are of interest as a study of Chinese organizational stakeholder relations and development, they are also of particular relevance to Western companies that seek to form joint ventures with Chinese ones. These Western companies have to adjust to local practices and at the same time operate globally. Given the current Western debate over corporate social responsibility, it may be possible that both Western and Chinese corporations can learn from each other, with the new hybrid companies developing models for business practice that can be relevant and acceptable globally."

Wrapping Health Messages With a Smile: The Potential of Entertainment-Education Programs for Children and Adolescents,,,,Paper,The Epilogue: A Secret Ingredient for the Entertainment-Education Strategy?,Is Entertainment Better Information? Wrapping Health Messages With a Smile: The Potential of Entertainment-Education Programs for Children and Adolescents,"The Entertainment-Education-strategy envisions complementing an EE-program with an epilogue. While the EE-program itself tries to hide the message in an entertaining narrative to prevent counterarguing, an epilogue is a short clip attached to each episode which unhides the pro-social message and tries to additionally anchor it on a cognitive level. The very successful childrens Entertainment-Education show Lazytown attempts to provide nutritional information in an entertaining way to improve childrens knowledge, attitudes and behavior towards nutrition. While successfully applying the EE-recipe (narration, identification and role modeling) to the show, the potential of an epilogue is wasted. An experimental study with 149 German elementary school children age 8 to 11 tested the influence of an additional nutritional epilogue on knowledge, attitudes and nutritional behavior. The four experimental groups were exposed to stimuli varying from no nutritional information (control group; no epilogue) to a high quantity of nutritional information (Lazytown episode; epilogue). As expected, children in the high quantity condition showed better knowledge, less uncertainty, more positive attitudes towards healthy food or respectively, more negative attitudes towards unhealthy food and better nutritional behavior. Interestingly, results show no significant interaction between episode and epilogue, since both are triggering different effects for different subgroups."

This paper presents an inquiry into a globally emerging health policy reform initiative: Open Disclosure. We review the policy and research literature that describes Open Disclosure as intending to promote open and honest discussions about adverse events with affected patients, families and with staff involved or implicated, while at the same time constraining how these discussions are enacted. We present an analysis of a corpus of interviews about the impact of Open Disclosure on clinicians practices. Our article links the practice of Open Disclosure to the argument that health care workers are increasingly expected to do emotional labour with patients and their families. In deploying reflexive listening, the practice of Open Disclosure risks becoming a therapeutic technique for risk managing patients and family members emotions in response to incidents. We conclude with emphasizing the importance of relational ethics to the ultimate success of Open Disclosure."

It is argued that in networks with specified conditions, stable links will be supported by particular surrounding structures that enable nodes to effectively evaluate the linkage. It suggest that because this is a universal property of all stable linkages, it can be used to derive predictions that apply to networks in general, thus initiating the process of building a network theory."
2008-1382,The Evolution of Online Communities: A Structural Perspective,The Emergence and Growth of Online Communities in Theory and Practice,,,,Paper,The Evolution of Online Communities: A Structural Perspective,The Emergence and Growth of Online Communities in Theory and Practice,"Monge and Contractor (2003) propose the analysis of the evolution of organizations through the study of both the entities within the organization and the networks between them. We apply the concepts of organizational ecology to examine the evolutionary processes that lead to community evolution as a function of information accessibility. We conducted an analysis of online discussion data from a community of Usenet discussion forums. A sample of midsize communities was selected and modeled using the XPNET family of software. Using multiple networks we examined the characteristics of the discussion community at various stages of development. Through a combination of quantitative analysis and qualitative industry data we illustrate the function of evolutionary processes of variation, selection and retention in online environments and provide an examination of the underlying mechanisms behind these processes. In particular we examine the role of information resources as a determinant of community success."
2008-1383,The Evolution of Online Community Networks,The Emergence and Growth of Online Communities in Theory and Practice,,,,Paper,The Evolution of Online Community Networks,The Emergence and Growth of Online Communities in Theory and Practice,"Organizational communities are typically defined as populations of organizations that are tied together by networks of relations in overlapping resource niches. Traditionally, evolutionary theorists and researchers have examined organizational populations that comprise organizational communities focusing on their properties rather than the networks that link them. However, a full understanding of the evolution of organizational communities requires insight into both organizations and their networks. Consequently, this article presents initial efforts to apply evolutionary theory to online organizational and community networks. It focuses on evolutionary principles, including variation, selection, and retention, that lead to the formation, growth, maintenance, and eventual demise of online network linkages. This perspective allows us to understand the ways in which community survival and success are as dependent on their organizational linkages as they are on the organizations they connect."
2008-1384,The Evolution of the HIV/AIDS Hyperlink Network,The Emergence and Growth of Online Communities in Theory and Practice,,,,Paper,The Evolution of the HIV/AIDS Hyperlink Network,The Emergence and Growth of Online Communities in Theory and Practice,"Hyperlink networks represent online communities without a formal structure, unlike wikis or discussion boards. The growing online network of nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) is an understudied type of interorganizational communication relationship. Hyperlinking among like-NGOs is a form of collective action. Contributions to this online community are governed by two decisions: how much to hyperlink and to which NGO(s) to hyperlink. In order to understand the varied influences on these decisions, this research examines the evolution of a HIV/AIDS NGO hyperlink network over one year. Using longitudinal network analysis, this paper examines the influence of both existing structures and attributes on the HIV/AIDS NGO hyperlink network. In particular, this research examines the influence common organizational descriptors, NGO location and hyperlinks from governmental organizations in the formation and dissolution of hyperlinks among HIV/AIDS NGOs over time."

This study presents a content analysis that examines that political content of three informational radio stations in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as a test of the effectiveness of the FCCs Outlet Diversity policy in promoting viewpoint diversity. Using content collected during the 2004 Presidential Campaign, the results suggest that the Outlet Diversity policy is failing as a proxy method for promoting a diverse range of viewpoints."

While much has been written regarding violent content and its purported negative effect on children, this article is an in-depth examination of the FCCs report, which may likely be the basis for future Congressional action on this issue. The article focuses on several flaws the author identifies in the report, but its main focus is the authors concern with the FCCs superficial legal analysis. In particular, the FCCs heavy and almost sole reliance on FCC v. Pacifica in its conclusion that Congress can constitutionally regulate violent material on broadcast television. By focusing so heavily on Pacifica, which is indeed relevant, the FCC fails to take into account the distinct difference between the content to be regulatedindecency as opposed to violence. As the FCC elevates the medium over the content in its analysis, the article uses Marshall McLuhans famous assertion that the medium is the message as an underlying theme throughout the paper. The article not only examines the FCCs failure to examine the content issue from a legal standpoint, but discusses additional cases that will likely be relevant in any constitutional analysis."
2008-1387,The Fear of Normality - The Swedish press use of surveillance images in the reports on The London bombings in July 2005.,The Ethics and Aesthetics of Authenticity in News Images,,,,Paper,The Fear of Normality - The Swedish press use of surveillance images in the reports on The London bombings in July 2005.,The Ethics and Aesthetics of Authenticity in News Images,"The major form of visual representation of the terrorists of the so-called London bombings in 2005 were surveillance images of the four terrorists made prior to the attack. These widely-circulated images, perhaps more than traditional news photographs, seemed to be viewed as the raw material of reality in ways that strengthened their presumed level of authenticity and objectivity, although they lack the technical quality characteristic of professional photojournalism. Focusing on the Swedish press, this paper considers how these surveillance photographs were framed within a context familiar from real crime representations, while paradoxically highlighting the normality of the four mens appearance and behavior. The paper discusses how this absence of a clear-cut representation of the terrorists evident in other contemporary media portrayals of the Muslim terrorist produced a sense of fear of future attacks and also enhanced stigmatization of large groups of people living both in Britain and elsewhere."

Through the lens of a social and cultural historian the author analyzes television news reports aired on Mexican television in 1959, focusing on presidential visits abroad and foreign dignitaries visits to Mexico. The analysis reveals: 1) quadripartite tensions among Mexico, the United States, Cuba, and the Soviet Union; 2) leaders from all four nations used television news to promote differing political agendas; 3) these leaders emerged as the first television diplomats. Few historians have examined the role of television news in Mexican society. This paper advances knowledge about the growing importance of television news for Mexico and beyond."

Building on studies of hyperlinked networks of Web pages, social network analysis methods are applied to construct a model of information flow among groups of Web pages. We use Kleinbergs authority-hub model and construct a modified system introducing providers as the sources of information in the network. Examining linking patterns and the flow of information, the influence of a small number of central information aggregators is analyzed as the result of their network position and central roles as brokers of information.
Data was collected from 239 news-oriented Web sites, and an examination of the formal structure of the digital news network was conducted. Significant support was found for the modified authority-hub-provider model, illustrated in the flow of information from providers through a network of authorities and hubs. Further, linking between sites was found to be a function of position in the network and brokerage roles. The high-degree of brokerage played by information providers (news services) is also indicative of the continuing consolidation of content in the industry. Contrary to previous studies of trust and brokerage, the findings suggest that the notion of closure is not a necessary condition for the existence of trust in an online network. Rather, identification of trusted information is dependent on network reputation systems such as linking history."

In addition, previous findings indicating a degree of social expertise afforded to artists is re-examined to determine the effects of receiver biological sex and gender. Results indicating that the sex of both the receiver and the source may affect credibility ratings of different individuals provide partial support for the authors hypotheses. Furthermore, dissimilar patterns of response based on sex and gender offer compelling support for the use of gender as a variable of study independent of sex."
2008-1391,The Fourth Estate as Superpower? An Empirical Study on Perceptions of Media Power in Belgium and the Netherlands,European Politics,,,,Paper,The Fourth Estate as Superpower? An Empirical Study on Perceptions of Media Power in Belgium and the Netherlands,European Politics,"The power of the media has long been at the centre of communication studies, mostly focusing on the effects they have on the public. Power over politics is far less studied, however much politicians complain about such media power after a lost election or when observing political cynicism among the public. In this paper the results of a survey of politicians and journalists in Belgium and the Netherlands is presented, showing the perceptions of power they have about each other. The general picture is that in both countries, members of parliament have a negative image of political journalists, especially with television: they have too much power, can make and break politicians and (too) often set the political agenda. Sometimes journalists share this view, but they accompany it with a rather negative view of politicians: they do anything to get attention from the media. Although often referred to as ?the Low countries?, Belgium and the Netherlands do not show the same picture, with Belgian politicians generally more negative about the journalists? power than their Dutch colleagues."

First of all, we review Roland Barthes and Göran Sonessons theoretical perspectives towards pictorial semiotics and then propose four essentials to distinguish the features of pictorial texts, especially those of print advertisements. These four essentials are types of code, goals, media and textuality. Furthermore, we find the Calendar Posters textuality, the configuration of both linguistic text and pictures that produces meanings, is in the pattern of that pictorial meanings are restrained by linguistic text, and the core visual sign of this genre is the framed female image. At last, the present study explores different layers of the significances of the two major signsthe frame and the female image. According to the analysis, from prostitutes to movie actresses, there had been dramatic changes of female characters in the posters due to the invading capitalism accompanied by economic growth and western modern culture. The female image in these Calendar Posters represents no longer an object of desire for male gaze as those in common commercial posters depicted by Goffman, Buker or Page. In fact, the significances of the female image go far beyond the frame of feudalization and tradition, signifying the consumers expectation of a better future, and this better future will be achieved by a healthy, well-educated and independent fine woman. The female image signifies beyond the frame. The female image of Classic Shanghai Calendar Posters subverts the patriarchy embedded in Chinese feudalistic tradition and Western capitalism, and it finally reserves a precious moment of revisiting Chinese women history from the perspective of pictorial semiotics."
2008-1393,The Future of Comparative Journalism Research,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges",,,,Paper,The Future of Comparative Journalism Research,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges","Comparative research in journalism studies has become increasingly popular in recent years. The end of the cold war and the onward march of globalization gave a fresh impetus to the mobility of researchers. In addition, new communication technologies triggered the rise of global institutionalized networks of scientists, while specialized degree programs, conferences and newly created scholarly journals address the growing importance of comparative research in communication and media research. However, unlike in other fields of the social sciences and humanities, comparative inquiry in journalism studies is still an underdeveloped branch. This paper, therefore, points to future areas of and challenges to comparative research in the study of journalism. It argues that journalism studies need to develop theories and models that are sensitive to the cultural distinctiveness of non-Western societies and that we need to carry out more explanatory work that extends beyond simple description of commonalities and differences. The paper argues for more methodologically deliberate comparative research and more comparisons of cultural units within or beyond national boundaries. The Western dominance in comparative research should be counterbalanced by including more cultures from the global South. Finally, the paper makes a case for more collective and collaborative research in cross-cultural journalism studies as well as for the institutionalization of existing global research networks."
2008-1394,The Future of Globalized Journalism Research,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges",,,,Paper,The Future of Globalized Journalism Research,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges","Globalization brings the growing perception of the world as a single place, a compression of social relationships, and acceleration of interaction within them. Understanding the idea of journalism within this process means going beyond a general update of news systems and practices in various countries to reconceptualize many of our measurements and questions. Transnational ownership, non-national technological reach, extra-national diasporic communities, and supra-national governmental forms have weakened the connection between journalism and its traditional nation-state base, leading to increasingly global logics within journalism as a profession. As useful starting propositions: (1) The reach, interconnectedness, and virtually real-time properties of a globalized media contribute to our experiencing the world as a whole, shaping the intensity and nature of that experience. This evolving media system creates a global news arena. (2) Journalism, as a practice and interpretive community, is adapting to this emerging global news arena and increasingly must navigate between its traditional vertical orientation within whatever nation-state it is carried out and a horizontal perspective that transcends national frameworks. (3) A cultural identification is emerging among those involved with this new global dimension. A professional identification, more specifically, is emerging within journalism, which increasingly shares common norms and values adapted to the needs of a more globalized system. It is time to examine how societies adapt to the inevitable flows of information and the professional logics that accompany themas a cultural globalization process, not just an economic one."
2008-1395,The Future of Interdisciplinary Journalism Research,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges",,,,Paper,The Future of Interdisciplinary Journalism Research,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges","The future of interdisciplinary journalism research offers a chance to realize and correct what the past of journalism research might have been and was not. In that scholarship on journalism has traditionally proceeded in demarcated and generally autonomous tracks aligned with different disciplinary fields, journalism has not yet been examined across the different disciplinary pockets involved in its study. The result is that we still lack an understanding of journalism that accounts for all that it is. Arguing that journalism is too important not to be considered more fully, this paper argues for the necessity of interdisciplinary research in moving forward in journalisms study."
2008-1396,The Future of Journalism Research Methods,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges",,,,Paper,The Future of Journalism Research Methods,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges","This presentation will focus on the kind of journalism research methods that I think are most likely to be useful in the future for providing new insights into the practice of journalism and the work of journalists. In particular, I will emphasize the need for multi-method approaches, both quantitative and qualitative, based on my own studies of journalists as well as those of other scholars. I will discuss which methods and which levels of analysis seem most useful for answering different kinds of questions about journalism and journalists, drawing on a variety of studies of journalists. I will also comment on the strengths and weaknesses, and advantages and disadvantages of various methods for future studies of journalists and journalism."
2008-1397,The Future of Theories of Journalism Research,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges",,,,Paper,The Future of Theories of Journalism Research,"The Future of Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Challenges","Based upon a systematization of the most significant journalism theories, the paper argues that the future development of journalism theories will not be based on the substitution of outdated theories, but on the gain in complexity through the emergence of new theories, the modification of older theories, and the integration of existing theoretical approaches. In particular, I will emphasize the need for theoretical approaches that not only describe the structures and functions of journalism on several levels ranging from the societal and cultural to the organizational and individual but also allow insights how these levels are intertwined. In order to explain the entire process called journalism more thoroughly than has been done so far, theoretical approaches focusing the production process and the journalistic products need to be linked with each other as well as with theories dealing with media uses and effects, including agenda-setting, framing, priming, cultivation, third person, etc. Therefore, I will describe how contemporary concepts of journalism already consider these requirements and how traditional communicator oriented journalism theories could be linked with theories of media uses and effects. Finally, the paper identifies important challenges of journalism research such as the globalization of the media, the hybridization of cultures or the growing relevance of non-professionalized forms of journalism and indicates what need to be done theoretically to meet these challenges in the future."

Much of the literature on reality programming and Survivor has been either textual or critical analysis, especially with regard to gender identity. Gender identity and construction in reality television is very important because of the mass audience that is created with reality programming.
This study utilizes Q method to gain a better understanding of how gender identity is perceived in the reality show Survivor. Forty-six participants viewed four episodes of Survivor and were then asked to rank order female contestants and then male contestants based on the most masculine to most feminine condition. From the results only one factor emerged for the female contestants. However, the male contestants produced four different factors."

After a theoretical background on the generative power of socio-technical controversies and issue framing, we examine the case of the Suroît, a natural-gas fired electric plant which was proposed by Hydro-Québec (HQ) and the Québec government in 2001 in order to respond to what was considered to be a shortage of energy. After three years of public scrutiny and deliberation that took place at two separate public consultations, the project was abandoned and shortly after replaced by a firm commitment by both HQ and the Québec government to develop new green energy sources in Québec, particularly wind energy. By a rhetorical analysis of key moments in the deliberation, we show that actors arguing against the Suroît contributed to the development of wind energy in Québec by framing this energy source as a viable solution to the gas-fired plant. This paper therefore provides empirical support for the constitutive perspective on socio-technical controversies which emphasizes the positive social influence of these events."
2008-1400,The Global Appeal of Visual Attraction  VFX and SFX as Blockbuster Strategies,Blockbuster Architecture,,,,Paper,The Global Appeal of Visual Attraction  VFX and SFX as Blockbuster Strategies,Blockbuster Architecture,"As blockbusters aimed at global audiences it seems sensible to assume that textual structures of these films have to attract the spectators all over the world. In a way polysemy is at work to generate multiple interpretations in different local contexts where the films are received. Supplementary to a calculable interest in the product blockbuster films need to generate and offer to its global audience a number of recognisable surplus values in order to earn sufficient revenues which would not only cover, but considerably surpass their exorbitant budgets. Because the commercial logic of contemporary Hollywood dictates the solicitation of multiple audiences for any single film, as Thomas Austin describes this phenomenon from an economical perspective, industrial strategies aim to engineer a range of possible pleasures and meanings and advertise their presence to different audience fractions (Austin 2002: 3). By anticipating divergent patterns of reception, the blockbuster draws on a number of exploitable elements. Apart from the indispensable star appeal provided by the featuring of first rate celebrities, the production of spectacular qualities via the use of special effects is a second element that looms large in this respect. Blockbusters provide a variety of spectacle. From Stars Wars (1977) to Titanic (1997), Pearl Harbour (2001) and the heavily pretrailed Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001, 2002, 2003), epics of fantastic events are designed to play strongly to the audio-visual qualities of the theatrical experience. (King 2003: 116)
The attraction of visual and special effect-generated sensational spectacle is one important structure of blockbusters textuality. The paper will describe the development of VFX and SFX elements in the past decade and discuss whether visual attraction has an universal appeal to different audiences in different local contexts or visual attractions are part of a specific aesthetic reading formation according to blockbusters that work globally.

As India integrates further into a globalized free-market economy, Indian films are likely to have a global reach attracting new viewers, beyond their traditional South Asian diasporic constituency. This paper maps this phenomenon, examining the hype associated with globalization of Indian cinema and the hope that it may generate more pluralist global cultural interactions. It examines how a combination of national and transnational factors, including deregulation of media and communication sectors, the availability of new delivery and distribution mechanisms as well as growing corporatization of the film industry, has contributed to global visibility of popular Indian cinema.
Specifically, the paper maps the cultural and institutional impact of Bollywood in the United Kingdom. Using a political economy and institutional analysis approach, it tracks the growth, impact and import of the cultural industries of Bollywood. Keeping in mind wider debates about global flows and contra flows it offers a critical assessment of Bollywood as an important force for the creation of identities and community in India and its diaspora."

The main research purpose is the formulation of good governmental communication practice in the context of terrorism. A first, exploratory study, focussing on source credibility, quantity and quality of information and communication style was carried out. The interdependency between these concepts was scrutinized via an experimental design (n=120). Based on the results, some concrete communication guidelines for risk communication were formulated. Governmental messages should primarily have an informative nature, providing the citizens with specific facts and figures. The second study is a quantitative survey study (n=1558) that reveals the strong relationship between perceived governmental risk communication and risk regulation. Three structural equation models provide us with statistical proof for the causal relationships between perceived governmental risk communication and regulation, combined with the concepts of opinion leadership and need for participative communication. The main conclusion is that we should come to a (re)definition of the government as a risk communicator as the increase in civilian trust in the government as a communicator strongly influences the trust in the government as a risk regulator. Even though there is no large need for participative bottom-up communication, governments should take initiatives to create communication platforms to provide citizens, and especially the opinion leaders, sufficient, qualitative and reliable information."

It could be said that the arrival of new species in the media environment is transforming the whole ecosystem. Theoretical reflection on these mutations is an ongoing process that must be developed while the diffusion of new technologies and practices are still transforming the bases of the broadcasting system.
If we consider that the new textualities coexist with the old ones in the same media ecosystem, then it could be an interesting exercise to analyze the contaminations between them. In this paper we analyze the aesthetics of new audiovisual productions and the transformations of the television interface in order to identify the pertinent traits of what we define as hypertelevision.
The paper reflects on the multiplication of narrative programs in television series of the last decade. After a quantitative analysis of the structure of the programs characters, the paper deals with a semiotic analysis of the series narratives. Finally, the paper concludes with a reflection about simulating interactive experiences in contemporary television."

Despite this, national surveys routinely find that the typical child spends between four and five hours per day watching TV. Given the apparent discrepancy between recommendations for viewing and current viewing practices, we sought to identify the factors that shape adolescents television viewing through an ecological theory framework. A web based survey was carried out with a convenience sample of 389 Black and White 14- to 16-year-olds in order to examine the relationship between adolescent trait characteristics, home ecological factors, and television access and the amount of time youth spend watching TV on an average day. Television viewing time was positively correlated with access to television in the home. Youth with a bedroom TV, more household sets, and access to premium cable channels watch significantly more television. Analyses reveal different patterns of use and access for White vs. Black respondents. Specifically, a bedroom television set was a strong and significant predictor of TV time for White respondents but not Black respondents, while the number of television sets in the home was a significant predictor of television time for Black but not White respondents. We argue that interventions that seek to reduce television time for teens must be carefully tailored for distinct adolescent populations."

The author delves into the rise of gay and lesbian radio, follows its successes and failures through the years, and considers the impact of its new advocate, corporate radio, on programming toward the queer community. The history of gay and lesbian radio is one that is far from complete, and the progress of queer radio has been riddled with struggles from within the LGBT community as well as from the outside. When gay programmers have reached out for financial support, very few station managers were able or willing to provide necessary financial support or appropriate airtime or time slots to develop an audience. The pioneers of gay radio spent countless hours and resources to provide listeners access to issues and programming not typically available via mainstream commercial or sometimes public radio stations. What might appear as a sudden emergence of queer programming on the dial for many listeners has been a steady evolution and dedication for nearly a half century."

We focused on documents that used the term choice, the industrys euphemism for addiction. We applied text mining and computer-assisted content analysis to the 7 million documents from the tobacco industrys internal records maintained online by the Legacy Foundation. Semantic network analysis, combined with factor analysis, yielded major issues for each year of the decade; words comprising each factor suggested industry framing strategies. We found that specific issues in public discussion changed during the 1990s, shown by the tobacco documents move from an aggressive pro-tobacco stance in the early 90s to a muted consideration of tobaccos place in a newly health-conscious society at the end. However, while the issues changed, the framing of the issues did not. The documents revealed a remarkably consistent set of ideological beliefs, founded on the association of tobacco products with traditional American values like freedom, individualism, and responsibility. We conclude that meanings ascribed to the tobacco industry function as cultural shorthand, and the discourse about tobacco policy reflects changing US beliefs and values, which veered toward increasing conservatism during the decade. Anti-smoking measures cannot fully succeed without taking this consistent, closed worldview into consideration."

The cognitive structures assessed were attitude accessibility and decision styles (Need for Cognition and Faith in Intuition). A 2 (gender: Male vs. Female) 2 (race: Caucasian vs. African American) 4 (message type) mixed design with message type as a within-subjects factor was utilized. Each teen (m age 14.97) was randomly assigned to view one PSA of each type that were presented in a random order. Multilevel modelling analyses showed that attitude accessibility and need for cognition interact with attitude to affect adolescents biased processing while faith in intuition negatively predicts perceived message bias. Race and gender were also significant predictors of perceived message bias. Implications for message design and health communication are discussed.
2008-1408,The Impact of Cultural Difference in Communication Style on Deception,Message Styles in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,The Impact of Cultural Difference in Communication Style on Deception,Message Styles in Intercultural Communication,"Information Manipulation Theory (IMT) views deception as arising from covert violations of one or more of Grices (1989) four maxims (quality, quantity, relevance, and manner). This study predicted that although messages produced by nunchi usually involves violations of the maxims, Koreans, who are accustomed to nunchi communication, would not judge the message as deceptive so long as the nunchi message is interpretable and appropriate to the situation. On the contrary, for the message violating the maxims covertly, Koreans as well as Americans will judge the message as deceptive, but there will be a difference in ratings on the deceptiveness of each type of violation between Koreans and Americans due to nunchi as a Korean form of indirect communication. These predictions were tested with a 2 experiment crossing cultural background, covert-overt violations and maxim violations. A total of 199 Americans and 256 Koreans read scenarios in which nunchi is typically considered in Korea, and then the messages involving nunchi and covert violation were also presented. Finally, participants rated the deceptiveness of the messages. The predictions were partially supported. Koreans viewed nunchi messages (i.e., overt violation messages) for quantity and manner violation as significantly more deceptive than Americans. However, the deceptiveness ratings between two nations, in general, were not moderated by cultural difference in communication indirectness."

Using Gerbners cultivation theory as the theoretical framework, the study examined the effect of South Korean drama consumption on the perceived prevalence of single life and of having fewer children in married life. The study also tested the causality of cultivation effects through a priming methodology. Results indicated consumption of dramas that positively depict the lifestyles of singles and married people with fewer children significantly affected the perceived prevalence of having fewer children in married life among viewers. However, the exposure to dramas did not influence the perceived prevalence of single life. The findings provide public health policy makers and communication campaigners with valuable theoretical insight as they develop campaigns to increase declining birthrate in South Korea. Additional discussion of the practical implications of the study findings are provided."

A theoretical model was set to test correlations between the adoption of official media frame and several blocks of factors, media reliance, media credibility and individual perceptions.

It turns out that about 80% of subjects were not aware and had no knowledge about Chens scandal. As expected, the credibility of domestic media positively, and the overseas media negatively related to acceptance of official interpretation; the reliance on domestic media for information related to Chens scandal is also related to high levels of acceptance of the CCPs frame. Two out of four perception factors-agreeing with governments opinion express policy and conflict solving policy-seemed good predictors of the adoption of official frame"
2008-1411,The Impact of Media Systems on the Making of Informed Election Outcomes,Media Effects on Elections,,,,Paper,The Impact of Media Systems on the Making of Informed Election Outcomes,Media Effects on Elections,"This paper seeks to explore whether different organization and penetration of mass media create different chances for the electorate to successfully emulate fully informed voting behavior. In other words, we are asking if there is something in the structural characteristics of media systems that is particularly helpful or particularly detrimental for the production of a well-informed electorate that can make such choices on the basis of the inevitably limited information that the electorate can possess that truly mirror the choices that the same citizens might make if they had encyclopedic knowledge of political facts. We postulate, inter alia, that the probability of fully informed election outcomes is increased by the pluralism of the media, and the penetration of high-brow and/or commercial and/or print media and also examine the impact of press-party parallelism. The empirical analysis uses cross-national survey data from post-election studies and macro-data on politics and media systems from multiple sources, an adapted version of Bartels (1996) simulation method to estimate fully informed outcomes, and a novel measure of political knowledge (understood as the inverse of uncertainty) among citizens."
2008-1412,The Impact of Television Narratives on the Early Literacy Skills of Preschoolers,Media Effects on Children: Spotlight on Literacy and Advertising,,,,Paper,The Impact of Television Narratives on the Early Literacy Skills of Preschoolers,Media Effects on Children: Spotlight on Literacy and Advertising,"Research has shown that well-developed television programming can act as an informal educator within the home and aid in the emergent literacy skills of young children across a variety of domains including vocabulary development, phonemic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, text comprehension, narrative abilities and related story schema skills (see Author, 2006 for an extensive review). Unfortunately, however, researchers have largely overlooked televisions natural capability as a storyteller and the impact it can have on a young childs literacy skills. Using an experimental framework, we examined the impact of two types of televised narratives (traditional and embedded) on childrens literacy skills. Our results show that, across most aspects of narrative competence, story knowledge, and vocabulary knowledge, TV narratives are successful  however, the impact differs based on the narrative structure utilized."
2008-1413,The Independent Production of Culture: A Digital Games Case Study,Game Studies Top Papers,,,,Paper,The Independent Production of Culture: A Digital Games Case Study,Game Studies Top Papers,"Throughout the community of game players, developers, and journalists, the term independent is used in a number of ways to describe a type of development next to, or juxtaposed with, the mainstream process of creating, marketing, distributing and playing digital games. Yet this independence is something quite different from what the literature on independent, alternative, oppositional, radical or otherwise non-mainstream media tends to suggest or advocate. The contemporary context of game design and development practices throughout the industry forces us to rethink assumptions about independence and autonomy in creative labor, about the communicative practices between media companies across the entire business spectrum of the global media industry, and about diversity or homogeneity in the production of culture. In this paper, we aim to articulate more precisely what it means to create, work in, and give meaning to independent computer and video game production."
2008-1414,The Influence of Cultural Values on Perceptions of Corporate Social Responsibility: Application of the Hofstedes Dimensions to Korean Public Relations Practitioners,Antecedents and Consequences of Corporate Social Responsibility in Public Relations,,,,Paper,The Influence of Cultural Values on Perceptions of Corporate Social Responsibility: Application of the Hofstedes Dimensions to Korean Public Relations Practitioners,Antecedents and Consequences of Corporate Social Responsibility in Public Relations,"This study explored the relationship between Hofstedes cultural dimensions and public relations practitioners perception about CSR in South Korea. The survey on Korean public relations practitioners revealed that though the Hofstedes dimensions significantly affect public relations practitioners perceptions of CSR, social traditionalism values had more explanatory power than cultural dimensions in explaining CSR attitudes. The results suggest that practitioners fundamental ideas about the corporations role in society seem to be more important than their cultural values to understand public relations practitioners CSR attitudes in Korea."
2008-1415,The Influence of Family Communication Patterns on Willingness to Engage in Family Discussion about Organ Donation,Conversations in Families,,,,Paper,The Influence of Family Communication Patterns on Willingness to Engage in Family Discussion about Organ Donation,Conversations in Families,"One important characteristic that should be considered in the examination of family discussion about organ donation is that it is a behavior that individuals cannot perform on their own. They have to include their family members and they likely will communicate according to pre-existing patterns which already exist within the family structure. The current study examined whether attitude toward organ donation, intention to sign an organ donor card, and altruism were related to willingness to engage in family discussion about organ donation. More importantly, two dimensions of family communication patterns (i.e., conformity orientation and conversation orientation) were investigated as possible moderators of the effects of attitude, intention, and altruism on willingness to engage in family discussion about organ donation. Data with undergraduate participants showed that a conformity orientation weakened the positive relationship between attitude toward organ donation and willingness to engage in family discussion while a conversation orientation strengthened the positive relationship between intention to sign a donor card and willingness to engage in family discussion. Additionally, willingness to engage in family discussion was positively related to the self-reported behavior of family discussion about organ donation a week later."
2008-1416,The Influence of Internet Consultants,Mass Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Influence of Internet Consultants,Mass Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"Automated internet consultants, which give a personal advice starting from a comparison between personal viewpoints of internet users on the one hand and objective attributes and issue positions of suppliers - e.g. firms or political parties - on the other, have gained momentum during recent years. The research question of this paper is whether such advices exert influence. This question is answered on the basis of a study of the influence of two political internet consultants from the Netherlands, Stemwijzer and Kieskompas. A panel survey study was used to measure party preferences before and afther an eventual advice to vote for a specific party. The results show that internet advices exert a considerable influence indeed. The probability to vote for a non-preferred party increases from 4% to 19% in the case of a positive advice. The probability to vote for one's preferred party decreases from 73% to 52% in the case of a negative advice. The paper discusses in addition the reasons why advices from internet consultants may be invalid and unreliable."

Wrapping Health Messages With a Smile: The Potential of Entertainment-Education Programs for Children and Adolescents,,,,Paper,The Influence of Parental Mediation on Childrens Usage of Entertaining Television Programs,Is Entertainment Better Information? Wrapping Health Messages With a Smile: The Potential of Entertainment-Education Programs for Children and Adolescents,"Parents handling of childrens television usage has been demonstrated to be central not only for the amount of time children spend in front of the tube but also for the programs children watch and for their understanding of the content. While there are numerous investigations in the U.S. which deal with the influence of parental mediation styles on childrens use and grasp of television in general and Entertainment-Education programs in particular there is a lack of such studies in Switzerland. However, for giving children the possibility to benefit from Entertainment-Education it is necessary to know how parents boost or hamper its usage.
To address this question 252 parents of children between three and 14 years in the German speaking part of Switzerland reported their mediation behavior and the television usage of their child. Additionally, parents opinions of positive or negative effects of television as well as sociodemographic variables were measured. Results show a complex pattern between parental mediation styles, childrens television usage and interceding factors. Results will be discussed with regard to parents possibly fostering or hampering childrens usage of Entertainment-Education."
2008-1418,The Influence of Press Releases on the Use of Strategic and Issue Frames,Framing,,,,Paper,The Influence of Press Releases on the Use of Strategic and Issue Frames,Framing,"The performance of contemporary journalism in the service of democracy has come to be increasingly criticized in the political sector. However, empirical evidence for the so-called media-logicthe media agenda has an ever growing effect on the political agendais not very solid. The research question in this paper is threefold: [1] How does attention for political parties during the Dutch 2006 national election campaign develops over time in press releases and news media? [2] To what degree does attention for frames in press releases corresponds with frames in news media? [3] To what degree does the tone of the frames in press releases corresponds to the tone of frames in news media? The study uses an agenda setting approach. The attention for the frames and the tone of the frames in news stories and press releases are measured via content analysis. All newspaper articles of six national newspapers and television items from two TV stations, that were published or broadcast between during the Dutch national election campaign 2006 (September 1, until November 22, 2006), are included within our database. Results show that the agenda set out by political parties via press releases significantly differs from the media agenda. Press releases of all political parties give more room for issue frames and less room for strategic frames, whereas the general tone of the frames is more positive in press releases than in news media."
2008-1419,The Influence of Problem Recognition and Involvement On Perceived Susceptibility to Skin Cancer,cial Factors and Susceptibility in Health Communication,,,,Paper,The Influence of Problem Recognition and Involvement On Perceived Susceptibility to Skin Cancer,Social Factors and Susceptibility in Health Communication,"This exploratory study attempted to extend the health belief model (HBM) to include the constructs of problem recognition and involvement from the situational theory of publics, which may act as precursors to perceived susceptibility. Although perceived susceptibility is often measured in HBM studies, there is little insight into what specific factors lead to perceived susceptibility and what communicators can do to increase these factors. This study addressed this gap in knowledge by exploring the antecedents to perceived susceptibility to skin cancer through in-depth interviews with female and male college students. Constraints related to sun-protective behaviors were also explored in depth, particularly with regard to wearing sunscreen. Results indicated that problem recognition and involvement play important roles in perceived susceptibility to skin cancer and motivation to attend to skin cancer messages among young adults. Theoretical implications for health behavior change theory and practical implications for skin cancer prevention messages are discussed."
2008-1420,The Influence of Race in Police-Civilian Interactions: An Analysis of Actual Intergroup Interactions,Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,,,,Paper,The Influence of Race in Police-Civilian Interactions: An Analysis of Actual Intergroup Interactions,Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,"Although the study of police-civilian relations has recently entered the intergroup communication arena, there are no studies of actual interactions between these social categories. In part to rectify that stark omission, 313 randomly-sampled video recordings from police cars on traffic stops in Cincinnati were extensively content analyzed. This revealed three key differences as a function of the officers and drivers races: (a) Black drivers were more likely to experience extensive policing during the stop; (b) The communication quality of White drivers was, on average, more positive than of the Black drivers; and (c) officers communication behavior was more positive when the officer and driver were of the same race. These findings are consistent with public opinion data and their practical and theoretical significance are discussed."

A total of 1198 Muslims and non-Muslims participated in the study. The analysis reveals being an immigrant or a native of a nation does not significantly influence ethnic media use in France, but does in Britain. Ethnic identification was also revealed as an influential predictor of ethnic media use among Muslims in both countries. Religiosity also yielded significant influence as a predictor of ethnic media use among the British Muslim population, but not among the French Muslim population. Differences between the French and British Muslim population is attributed to diversity in the two samples; the British sample has Sunni and Shia Muslims, while the French sample has only Sunni Muslims. The article concludes by arguing religiosity and ethnic identification should be included in studies examining media use among ethnic groups."
2008-1422,The Informal and the Institutionalized Dimensions of the Public Sphere,Textures of the Public Sphere,,,,Paper,The Informal and the Institutionalized Dimensions of the Public Sphere,Textures of the Public Sphere,"This analysis clarifies and extends several underdeveloped but significant new components of Jürgen Habermass public sphere theory. At center stage is the distinction between the informal and the institutionalized public spheres. These two dimensions of the political public sphere perform different functions within the macrosocial system of state, economy, and civil society. Communication scholars have long recognized the political public spheres critical function of holding state authority to account. But few have acknowledged its warning function of calling the states attention to widespread but privately experienced social problems. This warning function deserves more attention from communication scholars for two reasons. First, it clarifies how the political public sphere mediates between civil society and the state through discourses other than rational-critical debate. Second, it represents a phase of public sphere communication in which strategic action can serve as a socially useful antecedent to formalized decision-making."

In order to examine the interaction of individuals' sense of collective efficacy and their emotional state on intentions to engage in community behaviors, a single factor, three group experiment was conducted. Results indicated that individuals with higher collective efficacy who felt angry or anxious more likely to indicate intent to engage in community behaviors than individuals who had higher collective efficacy and felt content; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."
2008-1424,The Interaction Between Framing and Priming in the Context of an Alcohol Related TV Series,Understanding Personal Cognitions in the Framing Process,,,,Paper,The Interaction Between Framing and Priming in the Context of an Alcohol Related TV Series,Understanding Personal Cognitions in the Framing Process,"This paper aims to gain further insight into priming as the central psychological mechanism within the framing process. Framing and priming have been rarely combined in research, especially in studies employing realistic messages to represent the power of TV fiction. 412 youngsters (62% female; ages 11-21) viewed the same alcohol related excerpt from the TV series The OC. Beforehand, they viewed either gain-framed ads for alcohol, loss-framed public service alcohol-prevention ads, or non-alcohol related ads. Results indicate that the TV series generated significantly more alcohol related thoughts in the two alcohol related conditions. Participants passed significantly more negative judgments on the TV characters drinking behaviour in the loss-framed compared to the gain-framed condition. However, prior experience with alcohol moderated this framing effect. Causal reasoning regarding the program content turned out to be often the effect of primed real-life experiences with alcohol, whereas the effect of the framed messages is nullified."
2008-1425,The Interaction of Websites and TV Commercials in Advertising Campaigns,Advertising Structure and Effects,,,,Paper,The Interaction of Websites and TV Commercials in Advertising Campaigns,Advertising Structure and Effects,"Our study investigated which psychological processes could explain multimedia-effects of a combination of a website and a TV commercial. Results of an experiment (N = 332 students) showed that two out of three processes: -forward encoding and advertising convincingness- were present when participants were exposed to a combination of a website and a TV commercial. These processes were partly responsible for the effects of multimedia combinations on campaign results. Our study also provided insights into the effectiveness of multimedia campaigns. Multimedia conditions performed better than single medium conditions with respect to attitude toward the TV commercial. Multimedia conditions also performed best with respect to attitude toward the brand and purchase intention, but one or two exposures to the TV commercial provided the same results. Implications for theory and practice are discussed in the article."

This study examines one particular community, Smart Bitches who Love Trashy Novels. It uses ethnography of communication, focusing on two speech events within the community. These speech events are contests to gain 'titles' and 'covers gone wild'. Both examination of these speech events through discourse analysis and interviews took place. It is clear that these events create a sense of community for posters on the site through their shared enjoyment and knowledge of the romance genre. These can also be seen as rituals for the community. Limitations and directions for further research are discussed."

Evaluating Cross-National Evidence,"Drawing upon the World Internet Projects American data from 2002, 2005, and 2007, we present a longitudinal analysis of trends in Internet use and social connectivity. Each years survey has a random sample of 2,000 US adults, with approximately 1,500 Internet users. Our results call into question Robert Putnams Bowing Alone argument. We show that Americans are increasing in their social connectivity, with the Internet fostering this connectivity. Over the past five years, the number of virtual friendships has doubled; more online friendships are migrating to offline; Internet users have even more friends outside of household they communicate with regularly than non-users. There is also an increase of connections among people who share hobbies, political interests, religion, and professional associations. Internet users are participating in clubs or voluntary organizations at least as much as non-users, and possibly a little more."

expertise from interpersonal and electronic resources. A case study was conducted in a
university-affiliated community educational office. Using a concurrent nested mixed method
strategy, both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from its employees. Our results
showed that (1) the social relationships as well as the awareness of ?who knows what? is
crucial for seeking expertise and gaining actual access to information; (2) employees were
task-driven in expertise seeking and obtained different types of expertise depending on
availability; and (3) the choice between interpersonal and electronic resources was
determined by the characteristics of the expertise sought as well as such contextual factors as
time, cost, and location."
2008-1429,"The Interplay of Organization Type, Organization Size, and Practitioner Role on Perceived Crisis Preparedness: A Cognitive Appraisal Approach","Disappointment, Despair, and Image Repair: Crisis Communication in Public Relations",,,,Paper,"The Interplay of Organization Type, Organization Size, and Practitioner Role on Perceived Crisis Preparedness: A Cognitive Appraisal Approach","Disappointment, Despair, and Image Repair: Crisis Communication in Public Relations","This study proposed and tested a theoretical model of perceived crisis preparedness as a result of practitioner assessment of crisis situation and their perception of the organizations crisis resources. An online experiment was conducted among 144 public relations practitioners. Three enactments emerged as indicators of crisis preparedness: danger of the situation, uncertainty of the crisis, and the organizations crisis resources. The main effects of organization size and practitioner role were evident on practitioners perceived crisis preparedness in different crisis situations. Organization type was found to be effective only when it interplayed with either practitioner role or organization size. Organizations engaging in strategic communication in crisis should take these considerations into their practice and tailor their resource maneuvering and resource application to the situational demands for possible optimal crisis positioning and outcome."

While significant research has been done in the field of reputation, its relationship with trust and its influence on trustworthy behavioral intentions in different stakeholder groups needs further exploration. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the interrelations between corporate reputation, trust and behavioral intentions among members of four key stakeholder groups (N=1892) via structural equation modeling techniques.
Reputation was measured as an attitudinal construct comprising cognitive and affective dimensions. The study shows that different publics apply different facets within each of the reputation dimensions in evaluating reputation. The detailed analysis could help public relations to successfully address various publics through addressing those facets that contribute to building reputation and trust. Results confirm that in all groups reputation contributes significantly to build trust and trustworthy behavioral intentions."

This study argues that race and external factors such as attractiveness and youthfulness function as unfair criteria of newsworthiness in mainstream media coverage of women. Findings indicate that journalists overlooked missing Black women while they objectified missing White women. It is imperative to question how reporters present information to the public because news coverage of issues often sets the tone for how audiences perceive them. Additionally, medias reliance on a patriarchal representation of the world that values women based on looks and body size is detrimental to all women."

This paper examines the socio-cultural impact on risk perception of HIV/AIDS and on safe sex among behaviorally homosexual men who are excluded from major public health campaigns. A pair of studies (qualitative and quantitative) were conducted to assess (1) a clear definition of MSM categories in India and to provided evidence for perceived differences among these categories; (2) how behavior and risk are affected by stigma; (3) the nature of media use and dependency patterns among the different groups; (4) attitudes to condom use and negotiation skills. Results indicate that differences in sexual identity reflect differences in knowledge, susceptibility to risk and perceived self-efficacy."
2008-1433,The Ironic Hero of Virginia Tech: Healing Trauma Through Collective Memory of the Holocaust,Values in the News,,,,Paper,The Ironic Hero of Virginia Tech: Healing Trauma Through Collective Memory of the Holocaust,Values in the News,"News narratives related to collective memory perform a kind of healing function in society, bringing people together and guiding them through a cathartic process. Within American collective memory, the Holocaust becomes the high point that demonstrates and restates the nations moral character.

This study undertakes a textual analysis of news articles, opinion pieces and letters to the editor concerning the April 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech to examine how the narrative of the Hero contributes to the social healing process. Although several heroes are examined, the paper focuses particularly on the case of Liviu Librescu, a professor and Holocaust survivor who blocked the shooters entry to his classroom while students jumped out the window to safety.

The analysis found that emphasis on ironic elements of the story highlighted Librescus heroism and created a higher-order hero who could provide a stronger healing effect. Collective memory of the Holocaust was an especially important aspect of the irony, because Librescu died in what should have been the wrong time and the wrong place. Other themes in the newspaper narratives included teacher-heroes, student-heroes, and avoiding the anti-hero.

In all, the Virginia Tech case shows the important cultural role of the news medias hero narrative in times of social trauma. The hero shows hope for the future, encouraging people that they, too, may become a celebrated hero who can demonstrate that good will prevail over evil in society."
2008-1434,"The Korean War as Magical Realism: Memory and Healing in ""Welcome to Dongmakgol""",Philosophy of Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,,,,Paper,"The Korean War as Magical Realism: Memory and Healing in ""Welcome to Dongmakgol""",Philosophy of Communication Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"Upon its release in 2005, Welcome to Dongmakgol, a South Korean film about the Korean War, gained surprising popular and cultural attention. This project starts by questioning as to why such a filmic depiction of the Korean War was suddenly brought out to and attracted by the Korean public. In attempt to answer to the question, this paper examines how trauma films serve in the formation of popular memories and historicity. As some film scholars state, trauma films often employ fictional constituents to fill gaps between fabrics of historical records, which then become incorporated into popular memories in service of cultural identity. Here, in recalling a national traumatic event, and allowing viewers to experience this trauma repeatedly, the trauma film itself can be arguably said to perform in a similar way as an individual traumatic neurosis. This project, by examining Welcome to Dongmakgol through an analogy with Freud?s speculations of individual and cultural traumatic neuroses, investigates how the sudden return of the Korean War, through film, constructs historical memories in service of Korean historicity."
2008-1435,The Language of Coalition Formation in Multiparty Online Negotiations,LSI Studies on Interaction Online,,,,Paper,The Language of Coalition Formation in Multiparty Online Negotiations,LSI Studies on Interaction Online,"The purpose of this study is to examine linguistic behaviors in multiparty negotiations and their influence on coalition formation and stability. We utilize automated text analysis of online chat room interactions to understand how language differs between coalitions that reach a final agreement and those who do not, as well as how power moderates the use of language in varying proto-coalitional dialogues. The findings demonstrate that coalitions who reach a final agreement use more collective pronouns, more positive affective language, more assents and demonstrate more linguistic similarity with coalition partners than their counterparts. Low power coalitions demonstrate more positive affective language and more linguistic similarity than medium and high power coalitions. This study provides empirical support for previous theories of multi-party negotiations and suggests that using language that fosters a sense of unity, such as the use of collectivity, positive affect and mirroring, is effective in developing and maintaining coalitions in negotiation settings."

Relational partners (n=246) in established relationships (n=123) reported topics that communicatively trigger everyday conflict. The micro-level language of reported accounts (n=288) consisted of thirty-one (n=31) topics of relational conflict, consequently characteristic of seven (n=7) macro-level dynamics of relational conflict. These macro-level dynamics were subsequently utilized to develop a theoretical framework of topical conflict. The study, and the proposed model, aid in the exploration of understanding the symbiotic relationship that characterizes micro-level topics and macro-level dynamics of everyday relational conflict."
2008-1437,The Language of Trust Establishment in Face-to-Face and Video-Mediated Communication,Online vs. Offline,,,,Paper,The Language of Trust Establishment in Face-to-Face and Video-Mediated Communication,Online vs. Offline,"Trust is intimately tied to interpersonal communication which, in turn, can be influenced by the technology through which we interact. This study examines linguistic differences between the discussions of groups as they establish trusting behavior in face-to-face and video-mediated conditions. We find that although both conditions enable access to visual cues, the fact that mutual gaze is absent in the video-mediated environment disrupts communication, leading to more labored conversation. Adapting a framework of communication mechanisms in visual cues, we find reduced process coordination in video communication leads to shorter conversations, reduced interactivity, and less complex utterances. We also note reduced content coordination of topic and referring behaviors. Despite indicating increased social distance, groups in the video-mediated condition adapt their behavior to ensure that positive social cues are still communicated. Our results show less linguistic cues to trusting behavior namely reduced content coordination, indicators of increased social distance, and greater positivity."

An Historical Analysis of PSB Scheduling Strategies and Tactics: The Case of Flemish Television,High-Density Paper Session: Histories of Broadcasting,"A television channels identity is shaped by its output: not just the relative share of different programmes genres but equally so the relative position programmes take up in the schedule. This paper refutes the notion that the development of scheduling strategies and tactics - to make the programme schedules as interesting as possible for viewers  are a product of a commercial and competitive television environment. It will be demonstrated that, from its inception, public service television paid considerable attention to the way in which the actual programme schedules could help establish its wider, cultural education broadcasting goals. With Flemish public service television between 1953 and 1974 as a case, it is analysed how, first, European PSB created its own annual, seasonal, weekly and daily rhythm and, second, how contemporary scheduling strategies and tactics (compatibility, hammocking) can be identified in the monopolistic past, albeit interpreted along historically dominant PSB policy objectives."

2008-1440,The Levels of Visual Framing,Visual Framing and Politics,,,,Paper,The Levels of Visual Framing,Visual Framing and Politics,"While scholarly attention has centered mostly on the evaluations of texts in framing analysis, visual news discourse has remained relatively unexamined. One reason why this is the case may be the confusion surrounding how visual frames are supposed to be identified in the first place. This study surveys the visual framing techniques and methods that have been employed in previous studies and proposes a four-tiered system of identifying and analyzing visual frames in the news: (1) visuals as denotative-syntactic systems, (2) visuals as stylistic-semiotic systems, (3) visuals as symbolic systems and (4) visuals as ideological representations. These four tiers are defined and the process of identifying frames at each level is explicated. The proposed system can be applied whether the unit of analysis is any media material (media frames) or audiences individual perception of the overarching message of a visual (audience frames)."

I do this by reflecting on different dimensions that are associated with the concept of objectivity: (1) accuracy; (2) truthfulness; (3) fairness and balance, and (4) moral neutrality. It is asserted that in many cases journalists are not objective in their reporting either because they consciously prefer not to be or because they are being manipulated by their sources. I close by asserting that the values of not harming others and respecting others should play a prominent part in the considerations of journalists. These are basic ethical standards that sometimes require normative reporting. Consequently, morally neutral coverage of hate speech and racism is a bad idea. It is a false and wrong conception. Subjectivity is preferable to objectivity when the media cover illiberal and anti-democratic phenomena."

In addition, this analysis tested media (newspaper versus non-newspaper) and type of news (political versus non-political news) as two potential moderators of agenda setting effects. The results showed that without transformation, the estimate of the correlation coefficient was smaller, with a wider confidence interval, and that political news tends to have stronger agenda setting effects than other news."

Following a qualitative research programme of participant observation and in-depth interviewing, this case study offers a detailed history of Hobbiton?s creation as a film location and its continued evolution as a tourist site in a town previously unassociated with what might be termed the ?global popular.? Further, it explores the use of this story as a part of the location tour (which the titular quote references) and actors? articulation (in various terms) of the local/global cultural relationship. The paper connects its findings with the previous theoretical propositions of Couldry (2003, 2005) and Hoover, Clark & Alters (2004), who posit media as centering mechanisms in social life, either, in the first case, as a ?mediated center? of normativity, or, in the second, as a point of reference around which to create ?accounts of the media? which help define personal identity."

However, the process of reform and reintegration with the global market system has meant the loss of jobs, income, and social status for many Chinese workers, who are now officially designated as one of the disadvantaged or vulnerable social groups. The aim of this paper is to examine the depiction of laid-off workers in the rising market-oriented urban media outlets and analyze how the Chinese media, which now function as both as a political and ideological instrument of the party state and as a profit-driven economic unit, choose to report the conditions of laid-off workers. Furthermore, the paper will discuss a number of determining factors, including the medias political priorities, economic orientations, as well as the social capital of journalists and workers, in shaping the pattern of representation of Chinas laid-off workers. Relevant news reports in the year of 2006 from Chutian Metropolis Daily, a leading metropolitan newspaper in the central China province of Hubei, will serve as the focus of this study."

This study observes how reporting of foreign policy supports or challenges a government. Content analysis is conducted to measure media attention, valence, and news source. Media attention is measured by grouping the thematic frequency into 48 bi-weekly intervals. Valence is assigned to all voices appeared in a news story in accordance with its consistency with a nation?s foreign policy.

The research is conducted based on the following questions. First, there is a concern that the media reporting of foreign policy is constrained by a government. If so, how can the policy be contested by different forces? Second, if each nation?s journalism practice represents a unique mode of media and political system, how can the role of media in relation to government be compared?

This study found that first, the role the news media shifts in the range from a site of struggle to a site of ideological reproduction, depending on the existence of political challenge and the construction of critical media discourse. Second, when a nation?s foreign policy addresses national interests, it gains the support of its public. However, it has no guarantee to be equally supported by other nations if there is a conflict between two nations? interests. Constituting hegemony within a national boundary is not tantamount to constituting the same hegemony in the international community."

Drawing on data from two experiments allowing for replication within a single study, we demonstrate that exposure to both generic and publicity strategy news aroused political cynicism relative to issue-based news, but also that issue news dampened cynicism compared to when no news was consumed at all. In addition, we found positive interactions between political knowledge and strategic press and publicity news exposure, so that more knowledgeable individuals were more affected by these frames. However, political participation remained unaffected, thereby questioning the demobilizing impact of strategic news and metacoverage on political cynicism."

In this paper, the various strands of international research on the changing nature of journalism as a profession are synthesized, using media logic as developed by Altheide and Snow (1979 and 1991) and updated by Dahlgren (1996) as a conceptual framework. The theoretical key to understanding and explaining journalism as a profession is to focus on its self-similar reproduction or its continuing creative fragmentation, both trends supercharged by contemporary institutional, technological, organizational, and cultural trends."

The study recruited a random nationally representative sample of 402 adults aged 18 to 88 through the Annenberg National Health Survey, from June to July 2007. The study examined the distribution of public support for the use of antidepressant drugs to treat depression and anxiety disorders in youth, comparing groups who were exposed to advertising for antidepressant drugs with those who were not. The analysis was adjusted for effects of demographic characteristics, prior knowledge about prescription drugs, and personal and familial drug history. Attitude towards direct-to-consumer advertising was shown to moderate the effect of exposure to drugs for treatment of depression and anxiety on support for treating youth afflicted with of these conditions with antidepressants as a preferred treatment. Among respondents whose attitude towards direct-to-consumer advertising was negative, with increased exposure to ads for antidepressants the level of support for the use of these drugs to treat youth decreased (OR=0.43). However, this effect was offset among respondents whose attitude toward direct-to-consumer advertising was positive, among whom increased exposure to ads for antidepressants was associated with increased support for their use to treat youth (OR=2.99). The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the public debate surrounding the question of the potential benefits, and possible long-term adverse effects, of treating depression and anxiety disorders among children and youth with antidepressant drugs."

This study posits that when product attributes framed as a gain or a loss are compatible with ones self-regulatory focus, more fluent processing will occur and thus greater appeal will be elicited for consumers. A 2 (Regulatory focus: promotion vs. prevention) x 2 (Products attributes: hedonic vs. utilitarian) x 2 (Message framing: gain vs. loss) between-subjects design was used (N=215). As hypothesized, results showed that people found ads which fit their regulatory orientation easier to process than those which do not fit their regulatory orientation. Furthermore, ease of process was found to be a significant mediator between message framing and persuasion."
2008-1450,The Mediation of Policy Knowledge: An Interpretive Analysis of Intersecting Activity Systems,Top Three Papers in Organizational Communication,,,,Paper,The Mediation of Policy Knowledge: An Interpretive Analysis of Intersecting Activity Systems,Top Three Papers in Organizational Communication,"This paper uses structurating activity theory, an integration of structuration and cultural-historical activity theories, to examine how individuals construct policy knowledge. The study was conducted over a 5-month period and included 100 participants from organizational and non-organizational systems who interacted regarding special education policy. Interpretive analysis of meetings, emails, and interviews indicates that participants constructed policy knowledge through their interactions within and between activity systems. The constructed knowledge was mediated by system elements of divisions of labor, communities, rules, subjects, and both material and non-material mediating resources. Mediation occurred in varying ways that affect and help explain the power of staff and parents of children receiving special education, as well as policy outcomes. Results also indicate that the constructed knowledge served to reproduce structural dimensions of meaning, norms, and power. Conclusions indicate contributions of structurating activity theory for explaining policy and knowledge processes as well as directions for future research."

Does the online news meet users needs? Research into these issues found the answer to be negative. There is a breakdown between the news editors and the audience. One of the reasons for this is the two groups different systems of values.
All the news editors on Israeli television, as well as the main-stream online news editors were given a closed questionnaire based on uses & gratification. They marked the degree of journalistic importance of each parameter and the extent to which these parameters are treated within their programs.
Simultaneously, the questionnaire was presented to a representative sample of viewers (and was loaded in online news Forumes), who were asked about the importance of the parameters for them and the extent to which these parameters are found in television news programs (or in online news items).
Findings: a huge gap between the viewers and the editors in both the public and commercial channels. A later research that checked the online news users came into similar findings.
The research findings support researches that criticize the uses and gratification approach as explaining media consumption."
2008-1452,The Merchandizable TV Text and the Failures of Institutional Memory: The Green Hornet (1965),High-Density Paper Session: Histories of Broadcasting,,,,Paper,The Merchandizable TV Text and the Failures of Institutional Memory: The Green Hornet (1965),High-Density Paper Session: Histories of Broadcasting,"This paper explores the changing licensing and merchandising climate of the mid-1960s and its alignment with/ impact on network television financing and programming practices. In particular, it traces this history through a case study of the failed TV series The Green Hornet, produced by Greenaway Productions for ABC-TV in 1965. The property, which had been in existence since 1937, was owned by George Trendle, licensor of the Lone Ranger and Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. I argue that Dozier/ABC-TVs and Trendles competing memories over the Green Hornets value, as well as the roles licensors performed in maintaining said value played integral parts in the muddled production and merchandising campaign. While most analyses of memory and television focus on textual representations of history or audience recollections of particular programs, it is also important to consider how memories are strategically and selectively employed within the cultural industries at the production level. Both Dozier and Trendle looked back on the 1930s Green Hornet to justify their claims, each remembering quite differently the reasons for its success, while each also forgetting that The Green Hornet had never really been successful. In focusing on the roles licensing and merchandising, I identify a moment of integration within the cultural industries, occuring pre-conglomeration. As licensing and the negotiation of intellectual property rights have become globally recognizable business phenomena, we must also attend to the strategies, attitudes and values that informed corporate cultural production prior to  and as a precursor for  the current era of conglomeration."
2008-1453,The Message Design Logics of Responses to HIV Disclosures,Top Four Papers In Interpersonal Communication,,,,Paper,The Message Design Logics of Responses to HIV Disclosures,Top Four Papers In Interpersonal Communication,"The current studies use the theory of message design logics to investigate the relative sophistication of responses to disclosure of HIV status. In Study 1, 548 college students read 1 of 24 disclosure messages in which they imagined a sibling revealing an HIV-positive diagnosis. Their responses to the disclosures messages were coded as expressive (n = 174), conventional (n = 298), or rhetorical (n = 66). Type of message produced was associated with gender and with HIV aversion. In Study 2, 459 individuals living with HIV rated response messages that were taken verbatim from Study 1. Consistent with previous research on message design logics, expressive messages were rated lowest in quality and rhetorical messages were rated highest. The discussion focuses on the utility of message design logics for understanding the quality of responses to HIV disclosures and the implications of the current research for the theory of message design logics."

Hand-sketched print advertisements produced by student participants from a series of problem-based learning workshops (experimental group) and another series of lecture-based workshops (control group) for a bakery promoting Bread is life were examined with a semiotic approach. The ideas and associations with Bread is life being generated by the participants are a kind of meaning making. They are categorized into different signifiers. The similarities and differences between the signifiers used by the two groups of participants will be presented on an inter-group basis. The analysis of the sketches shows that the participants who took the problem-based workshops have generated a wider variety of signifiers than those who took the lecture-based workshops, reflecting a higher degree of creative flexibility enhanced by PBL. Theoretically, the empirical study addresses a number of conceptual issues in problem solving, creativity, advertising design, and PBL. Practically, it contributes to the understanding of applying PBL in advertising design education and how to well-prepare advertising design students with problem solving and creative thinking skills. Moreover, the knowledge and findings derived from this project can be of value to the development of advertising design training materials for the field."

This possibility was examined in an experiment in which 365 participants read a hypothetical scenario in which they were experiencing a problematic situation and a friend offered one of three forms of support (advice, emotional support, or emotional support plus advice). In general, results of this study indicated that high rationals tend to respond to advice more positively than low rationals. In addition, high experientials tend to rate emotional support as higher in quality than low experientials. The findings also suggest that emotional support is a generally desired form of support and it can be utilized in conjunction with other forms of support to enhance the effectiveness of supportive attempts."

Drawing from Grindstaffs motif of the money shot of emotional expression in daytime talk shows, I consider the routines of producing the money shot in The Biggest Loser, Queer Eye, Starting Over, and What Not to Wear. Like talk shows, makeover shows routinize the production of emotion through rituals of struggle and transformation. Both genres valorize authentic displays of feeling as the narrative climax of the show. Yet gender and class function differently between these genres: Audiences see male makeover candidates crying as a display of authenticity, whereas womens crying is often seen as fake and manipulative. Because emotional displays on makeover shows tend towards crying (not anger) caused by struggles with the self (not with others), these makeover shows affirm candidates middle class status, promote audience identification, and legitimate the shows educational, upwardly-mobile, rationale."

Feeling sadness, perceived reality, involvement, and enjoyment were measured after participants watched a sad film. Contrary to common sense, feeling sadness enhanced perceived reality, not vice versa. In turn, perceived reality increased the sense of involvement, and consequently involvement lead viewers to enjoy the sad film. We conceptualized enjoyment as a subjective experience of entertainment media, distinguishing entertainment in a narrow sense. Enjoyment measured by a self-referent item (e.g., I enjoyed the movie) was predicted more significantly by feeling sadness with a greater magnitude than enjoyment measured by an object-referent item (e.g., The movie entertained me). Object referent enjoyment was fully mediated by perceived reality, whereas self-referent enjoyment was partially mediated by perceived reality.

2008-1458,The Muslim Other in Bollywood Cinema,"Bollywood, Cultural Identity, and Globalization",,,,Paper,The Muslim Other in Bollywood Cinema,"Bollywood, Cultural Identity, and Globalization","This paper examines the important and contested role of Muslim actors in the popular Bombay-based Hindi film industry, Bollywood. Bollywood is often cited as a social microcosm of India, a world where the members of the majority and minority community work together to produce a staggering output of anywhere between 150-200 films on an annual basis. Further, in making the case for the secular environment of the film industry, it is frequently pointed out that not only are Muslims comparatively well-represented within its ranks in the form of writers, lyricists, composers, producers and directors but that  some of the most popular film stars of Hindi cinema, both male and female, have been Muslim (Ganti 2004: 23). Observers, has long claimed that it is characterized by a secular ethos, pointing both to the pluralistic composition of its workforce as well as the fact that the dominant trend within Hindi cinema has been the omission of conflicts driven by communal identity and a deliberate representation of communal fraternizing, or Hindu-Muslim bhai bhai best exemplified in films such as Amar Akbar Anthony and Coolie (Virdi, 2003, p.75).
This paper traces the history of Muslim actors in Bollywood, examining through their roles in different films, how Muslim actors have been incorporated into the discursive frame of the mainstream (masala) Bollywood film. We argue that despite the Hindi film industrys attempts to project a world unmarred by communal divisions, in effect its purported secularism always had significant limits as the representation of minorities in general and Muslims in particular demonstrateslimits that were defined in large measure by well-established, if unfounded, ideas of what audiences find acceptable and appealing.
We focus on recent developments in the Hindi film industry which has become more comfortable in the shadow of saffron (Salam 2005: n.p), i.e. the emergence of Hindu nationalism. As actor Farooque Sheikh puts it, whatever prevails in the society is bound to reflect in films. Bollywood is the safest place to reflect perceived social realitythe truth does not have to come into the picture (quoted in Salam 2005: n.p). We conclude with a discussion of the reigning super star Shahrukh Khan, (also known as King Khan) and his films. Khan despite his larger than life image, has felt it necessary to publicly state in an interview that while he is a Muslim, he is also a true blue Indian and that no one can take this right away from him,--in a truly secular industry, such a performance of identity would be unnecessary (Gupta 2003)."

In the context of Singapore, the views of two groups of partisans were examined in a quasi-experiment. In contrast to results from previous studies, audience size, or perceived reach, had no effect on perceptions of media bias. However, the make-up of the blogs target audience, or the relative percentages of in-group and out-group members, was found to exert a considerable effect on the perception of media bias. Furthermore, results indicate the presumed influence of the articles on the blogs target audience correlates significantly with partisans perceptions of media bias."

We discuss about the characteristics of the border inhabitants and their encounters which are constructing new cultural forms in a glocal space. Also, we examine the Mass Media convergence with the new Culture and we present the new Mass Media conglomerates which are making changes to cover the new border (Spanish language) market of information. Finally we show the media contenders in the México-USA glocal space and, we do some preliminary conclusions about the implications of this new structure."

A Comparative Analysis Between Public Television in Spain and Sweden 1995-2005.",Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper Session - Communication Law and Policy,"Public service broadcasting (PSB) institutions and practices in Spain and Sweden differ dramatically in many ways. PSB in Spain is generally characterized by commercially-oriented contents, financed by advertising and government budgets and with significant political interventionism in the media. On the contrary, PSB in Sweden can be defined as a puritan archetype of PSB media with information-oriented contents, financed a 100 % by licence fee and with a general political consensus on keeping PSB media independent from the government.

This paper analyzes public service television changes in institutions, practices and strategies in Spain and Sweden during the period 1995-2005 within a comparative framework. The paper also discusses the relative importance of national distinctive features and international media trends in explaining the development of public service television in Spain and Sweden in terms of market performance, revenues and program content. Thus, it may contribute to a general understanding of European Public Service Media in the Digital Age and encourage further, and more extensively, comparative research in this field."

The same should hold true for communication theories; agenda setting being a leading one. Today, there are more than 350 agenda setting studies, some examining non-Western cultures. These studies are based on contingent factors that are in most cases unique to Western societies. Cross-cultural studies rarely try and adapt the theory to the cultural, political and social variations present in different societies. In turn this might lead researchers to incorrect conclusions.

The idea that news networks do set the agenda in politics and diplomacy is not a new one. However, some networks have greater influence than others. CNN is one of those networks that has risen to global prominence because of its coverage of the first Gulf War. It is the network that moves world leaders to take action in remote parts of the world and sets the agenda for the public  hence the CNN effect. Today scholars claim that Al-Jazeera yields the same influence in the Arab/Islamic world. Therefore, it is appropriate to say that there is an Al-Jazeera effect. However, this claim does not rest on any empirical data. This study examines the agenda setting role Al-Jazeera plays in the Arab/Islamic world. This research also looks at the contingent factors for agenda setting theory in the Arab/Islamic world."

The analysis compares the studies according to their theoretical approach, their research techniques used, their sample size, the type of audience members studied, the type of television content researched and the scholars mentioned the most in their references. Findings show that cultural studies is by far the most popular theoretical approach, that television and daily life and the importance of mediations as the family are the topics covered the most in the studies, and that many studies still lack a solid methodological base. Morley, Orozco, Martin Barbero, Garcia Canclini and Lull are the scholars mentioned the most in the reference section. The paper ends with a diagnosis of the strengths and weaknesses of current Latin American empirical research on television audiences and points out the need for more methodological rigour and more emphasis on the analysis of ideological readings and impact."

This study used a quasi-experimental, between-subjects design in which 262 participants were exposed to a fictitious crisis case at their university and the universitys four different crisis-response strategies. The results of a two-way ANOVA revealed that regardless of the level of relationship, publics in the internal cause group were more likely to attribute responsibility to the organization than were those in the external cause group. A three-way MANOVA found the unique effects of relationship, crisis responsibility, and the type of crisis-response strategy on attitudes toward the organization in the crisis, but two-way and three-way interactions among these predictor variables were not significant. The findings suggest that the cultivation of relationships with publics, as well as the effective use of crisis-response strategies, is an essential part of successful crisis management."

The Australian Research Council (ARC) government funded national study, involved textual analyses, observation of participants, and interviews in 19 organizations in five Australian states across the public, private and higher education sectors. The author was a chief investigator on the project.
Given that a selection criterion for the chosen organizations was that they, atypically, had to have at least 30% of women at senior executive level, the concept of a ?tipping point??a critical ?mass? of women?was explored with the interviewees as a possible way in which deep-structure masculinised forms of organizational power and authority could be changed. As this paper delineates, the interviews provided critical spaces for the participants to reflect on and critique their corporate and individual sense of self within and against a reflexive, dynamic and changing network of power and gender relations. The paper focuses on one aspect of the research project: managing time in terms of the work?life continuum, which most of the senior executive women, and some of the men interviewed, experienced as a relentless conflict between work and life on a daily and weekly basis."

Drawing on Zygmunt Baumans (2005) analysis of liquid modernity the paper traces the shifting context of sport stars representation and reading in the public sphere arguing that the frames of stars perception have shifted from a Fordist model of national sporting heroes to transnational liquid stars, largely devoid of the denotative core that allowed Fordist sporting heroes to become rallying points of collective identifications and imaginations encompassing nationality, ethnicity, class and gender.

The paper thus suggests that the proliferation and globalisation of sports stardom as much as of the wider cultural phenomenon of celebrity are manifestations of the forces of liquid life, and thus deepen the entrenchment of our lifeworlds in the driving forces of global capitalism and consumerism. Rather than focusing on the inevitable fragmentation of collective identities that is the most often lamented aspect of these transformations, the paper explores the consequences of the amorphous semiotic state of sporting celebrity in liquid life which threaten to eliminate political discourses that have accompanied the position of modern professional sports at the heart of popular culture in industrialised societies.

Viewed through the framework of a media scandal, the study explores the simultaneous impulses inhered within scandals toward both affirmation of the social order and the opening of a potentially transformative space reconceptualizing military-state relations. While the most common themes through which the scandal was discussed  the notion that everybody must serve and the seemingly critical position maintaining the separability of popular culture from serious politics  were fundamentally aligned with the Durkheimian view of scandal as a conservative ritual, some significant discourse was nevertheless transgressive. It is suggested that rather than being completely resolved, the scandal persists as an evolving, adaptable cultural resource employed by social actors for varying ideological goals."

The personal health record provides a new virtual organizational setting for these activities, yet further research is needed to identify its impact. In 2003, the Veterans Administration of the U.S. government introduced a web-based personal health record to complement traditional services, improve co-managed care, and empower patients and their families. The My HealtheVet portal enables veterans to create and maintain a robust personal health record that includes access to trusted patient health education information, a comprehensive personal health journal, and additional features. This paper provides a review of the growing body of literature on personal health records and identifies salient research questions related to the impact of this new setting on the patient-organization connection."

Despite these findings, journalists use a lot of numerical material. This situation is called the number paradox in this article.
The number paradox can be explained if we regard numbers as rhetorical devices. Apart from their inherent meaning, they serve to increase ethos, they enhance credibility.
In a series of experiments, the influence of numbers on the assessment of credibility of a given news article is tested. The hypothesis is that the presence of numbers will increase credibility. Questions intrinsically included in this investigation are: which scale is the most suitable for measuring the concept of credibility in this type of experiment, and how does involvement influence this judgment.
The outcome of this research shows that there is a correlation between a readers judgment regarding credibility and the presence of numbers in an article. This conclusion could be drawn through measurements taken on varying scales. Moreover, this conclusion could be confirmed through the fact that an increase in the number of figures present led to increases in assessments affirming credibility. Any effect of the personal involvement variable could not be established."

Loss-framed appeals do enjoy a small but dependable advantage for messages advocating breast cancer detection behaviors (e.g., mammography) but not for any other specific disease detection behavior."

Following the instructors dismissal a controversy erupted in the mass media, in the blogosphere and across Web discussion boards about the limits of free speech, the responsibilities of university professors and whether or not the privacy of certain faculty and students had been compromised.

This paper explores the phantom professor case from a social capital perspective, arguing that blogs empower some users to use their voice to gain more social capital than their offline work environment allows, but that these gains are often constrained to the online context. In the offline interpersonal context, anonymous blogs can actually break down existing social capital and make communication within the organization more difficult. In addition, considerations about the differing types of social capital (bonding vs. bridging) are discussed."

The effectiveness of media policies on diversity is examined and discussed with an inquiry into the conflicting views of the First Amendment in terms of regulation and free market competition. This attempt is to first, illustrate whether an active role of government promoting media diversity can be made justifiable, and second, validate the critical relationship between source diversity and content diversity.

2008-1474,The Political Public,"Rhetoric, Witnessing, and the Constitution of Politics",,,,Paper,The Political Public,"Rhetoric, Witnessing, and the Constitution of Politics","This paper presents a conceptual analysis of the publics political character. It argues that this must be understood in three steps. First, one must look at the historically specific invitation to agency extended to the public. This invitation is found sedimented in law, institutions, and culture. Secondly, it is necessary to accept that this invitation does not have a precise addressee in the sense of a true public. It invites a disembodied public to act. Thirdly, the public is enacted in ways that are conditioned by the invitation and its disembodied addressee. Conceptually, such enactments take the form rhetoric calls synecdoche, a part expressing a whole, and are characterized by five traits. Enactments of the public are (1) dependent on external recognition, (2) always contestable, (3) mutually constitutive of the part and the wholethe public they attempt to enact, (4) either bringing the public to bear as an actual presence or a virtual shadow, and (5) necessarily normative operations predicated upon the substitution of an isthat the public is disembodiedby an oughtthat someone should be allowed to enact it as if it was not. The paper rejects the substantialist understanding of the public found in Habermas, Dewey, and Lippmann and lay out a concept of the political public that facilitates analyzes of the prospects of the public of today, and its contribution to cohesion and change, and not only lament its failures in the light of what it could potentially be in the future."

Building on a critical post-positivist approach to research, in alignment with tenets of a philosophy of language, the process of enumeration is posited as one of communication. Moreover, this construction is embedded within a political economic context in which institutions are responsible for the production and assertion of these numbers. Understanding numbers as political constructions means recognizing the ordinal character of nominal data, for example. Some of the political consequences of enumeration in practice need to be considered."

However, how the people negotiate with the political power and form their public in daily life through reading the popular press? On the one hand, as the ordinary Chinese people keep a distance with public affairs, they fail to respond to the coverage that is always controlled by the power of the state; it thus leads to peoples dissent and indifference towards the headline or important news in the popular press. On the other hand, compared with the stuffy and positive propaganda news that is far from their daily life, the trivial news happens under the circumstances that are more sensible and meaningful to them. People refer to their reason and sense in daily life to criticize what the truth is. In the meantime, their public has aroused through controversy and disagreement."

Data from a national sample of 399 Hispanic Internet users, over 40 years old, a traditionally digitally underserved population, were gathered through an online survey. As hypothesized, regression analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between Internet connectedness (Jung, 2003) and use of customized web portals. This indicates a new digital divide may be emerging between users and non-users of customized technologies. A separate regression analysis indicates customized web portals users report a significantly higher level of individual news category exposure diversity. This result suggests a positive relationship between customization technology and the public sphere. Additional implications of these findings and recommendations for future research are discussed."
2008-1478,The Positive Relations between Exposure to Sisimpur and Childrens Outcomes over Time,"A World of Learning: The Educational Impact of Sesame Street in Bangladesh, Kosovo, and the United States",,,,Paper,The Positive Relations between Exposure to Sisimpur and Childrens Outcomes over Time,"A World of Learning: The Educational Impact of Sesame Street in Bangladesh, Kosovo, and the United States","This study examined the effects of Sisimpurthe Bangladeshi co-production of Sesame Streeton the skills and knowledge of preschool-aged children (from 4 to 6 years old at baseline) in a national sample (N = 2,063). Using a longitudinal, three-wave panel design, researchers examined the relation between exposure to Sisimpur and childrens literacy, math, and socio-cultural knowledge. Analyses revealed robust associations between exposure and outcomes. Children with greater exposure consistently performed better than those with less exposure in tests of literacy, math, and socio-cultural knowledge. Furthermore, watching Sisimpur seems to confer the greatest benefit to the children who are neediest: those in rural areas and lower-income urban households. Exposure to Sisimpur is also related to increasing gains in skills over time, above and beyond the gains that might be expected with developmental maturation. This study offers strong evidence of Sisimpurs educational benefits for young Bangladeshi children."
2008-1479,The Primacy of Local Interests and Press Freedom: A Survey Study of Hong Kong Journalists,Media Policy,,,,Paper,The Primacy of Local Interests and Press Freedom: A Survey Study of Hong Kong Journalists,Media Policy,"Premised on the argument that articulating, representing, and at times defending local interests is one of the normative roles for the news media, this study examines what we call the primacy of local interests to the Hong Kong media and how concern with local interests relates to the politics of press freedom in the city. More specifically, on issues involving conflict of interests between the local society and its sovereign country, a large part of the Hong Kong media has demonstrated its willingness to stand by the local society, even though it could mean a need to directly confront China. This study further draws upon a representative survey of professional journalists in Hong Kong to illustrate how, in terms of Hong Kong journalists belief system, an orientation toward local interests is tied to liberal political attitudes, beliefs in the adversarial role of the media, and perceptions of the seriousness of media self-censorship. The analysis suggests how various kinds of attitudes and beliefs may cluster together to serve as an important counteracting force against the pressure to submit to the power center. Implications of the findings and the possible generality of the notion of the primacy of local interest are discussed."
2008-1480,The Priming Effects of Avatars in Virtual Settings,"Avatars, Characters, Narrative",,,,Paper,The Priming Effects of Avatars in Virtual Settings,"Avatars, Characters, Narrative","This study compares two priming models (The General Aggression Model and the Automaticity Model) predicting that a digital self-representation (i.e., avatar) exerts non-conscious influences on users. The results show that participants using a KKK-associated avatar created more aggressive Thematic Apperception Test stories in comparison to a control group. On the other hand participants using doctor-related avatars created stories with more affiliative themes, suggesting that virtual primes increase the probability of both positive and negative social effects. The results support the principles of the automaticity model of priming effects, and provide initial evidence for automatic processes in virtual settings."
2008-1481,"The Psychological Appeal of ""MyNews.com:"" The Interplay Between Customization and Recommendation Sources in News Websites","Choice, Customization, and Control",,,,Paper,"The Psychological Appeal of ""MyNews.com:"" The Interplay Between Customization and Recommendation Sources in News Websites","Choice, Customization, and Control","One of many ways current news Websites attempt to attract consumers and establish user loyalty is by employing strategies to guide users toward information that is interesting, important, and relevant to their needs and desires. Two strategies that are increasingly being used are customization--offering content personalized to an individual user, and recommendations--providing information about content based on the opinions and behaviors of others. Despite the growing prevalence of these strategies, little empirical research has examined users' psychological responses to such features in news websites. We report results from a 2 (customized, non-customized news) x 3 (audience as source, gatekeeper as source, control) experiment examining how customization and recommendations affect users' psychological responses. Results indicate customized news has powerful positive effects on attitude toward a news website, and that in the context of customization, recommendation source has no influence. We conclude by discussing theoretical implications for future research in new media."
2008-1482,The Psychology of Consumer Control Contextualized Within DVR Technologies,"Choice, Customization, and Control",,,,Paper,The Psychology of Consumer Control Contextualized Within DVR Technologies,"Choice, Customization, and Control","Current directions in the psychology of media consumption point to consumers' empowerment over their exposure to advertising. Yet, little research has been done, especially in the context of Digital Video Recorder (DVR) use. Through the DVR advertising behaviors of avoidance and involvement, this study advances current understanding of the psychology of consumer control through DVR use and the expected outcomes associated with such technology use. Specifically, the study explores the role that self-efficacy, advertising avoidance and desirability for control play on advertising related DVR behaviors and their impact on perceived television significance and advertising attention."
2008-1483,The Psychometric Property and Validation of a Fatalism Scale,Risk Perceptions and Fatalism in Health,,,,Paper,The Psychometric Property and Validation of a Fatalism Scale,Risk Perceptions and Fatalism in Health,"In this paper, we conceptualized fatalism as a set of health beliefs that encompass the dimensions of predetermination, luck and pessimism. A 20-item scale was developed as a measurement instrument. Confirmatory factor analyses were performed to test the dimensionality of the scale. Three external variables (i.e., genetic determinism, perceived benefits of lifestyle change, and intention to engage in healthy behavior) were used as reference variables to test the construct validity of the scale. Data from a web-based national survey (N=1218) showed that the scale was unidimensional on the second order, and with good reliability ( =.88). The relationships between the external variables and the first- and second-order factors provided evidence of the scales external consistency and construct validity."
2008-1484,The Public as New News Sources and News Intermediaries,Reconfiguring the Public,,,,Paper,The Public as New News Sources and News Intermediaries,Reconfiguring the Public,"This paper will examine the values and practice of producers who work outside media institutions or regular journalistic contracts and who are not already political actors (such as NGOs or campaigning groups), but who are setting themselves up as alternative news sources and news intermediaries in the digital media age. The focus will be on those who aim to be sources of news and fact, rather than simply opinion, although it will also include producers of sites that gather materials with some element of commentary. As such, the paper will look at what might once have been called the audience end of the digital news production process, investigating a new breed of writer-gatherer encouraged by the intensely accelerated generation and recirculation of information online.

Such non-professional or semi-professional writer-gatherers may take many forms: some are in effect parasitic on particular industries, such as tvnewser.com; some are general story warehouses that, by gathering stories from contributors, seek to recycle the huge flow of online stories in a form from which mainstream news can select. Others (closer to the US notion of citizen journalist) take up a commentary position, selecting stories that illustrate a particular point, in the hope of influencing debate on that issue. By analyzing how the producers of those sources themselves understand the dynamics and constraints, values and ethics of their practice and its contribution to the wider news industry, the paper will hope to supplement our understanding of the changing space of news production."
2008-1485,The Punk-Rock Presidency of Lil Bush,atires Second Dimension: Political Critique in Animated TV Comedy,,,,Paper,The Punk-Rock Presidency of Lil Bush,Satires Second Dimension: Political Critique in Animated TV Comedy,"With a punk-styled theme song introducing the animated series Lil Bush, the tone is set for an unprecedented brand of television satire ridiculing a sitting president. Portraying George W. Bush as a moronic and hubristic child cavorting with pals Lil Cheney, Lil Condi, and LilRummy, the show offers a brutal caricature that moves well beyond the kid-glove approach to satire offered on programs such as Saturday Night Live. As the shows creator noted, this presidentlends himself to thinking in a simplistic, cartoony fashion. Hes always been about sound bites, one-word answers, move ahead, act from the gut. Hence, Lil Bush becomes a vehicle for literally animating those behaviors. Casting the critique in animated form allows for satirical creativity, including over the top portrayals such as Bush and his administration as punk rockers, which the producers contend best represents the Bush administrations policies (Dive in headfirst.
Break stuff up. Dont care what people think). The program therefore trades in gross exaggerations that may not be funny. But the show is more an exercise in contempt for the president than an effort to get laughs. By making Bush an infantile punk, the program shows not only how ridiculous he is, but how ridiculous we are for letting him get away with it.

2008-1486,The Question of the Digital in Mediated Self-Representations,Digital Mediations of Personal Narratives,,,,Paper,The Question of the Digital in Mediated Self-Representations,Digital Mediations of Personal Narratives,"In this paper the importance of the digital for productions of self-representations is interrogated. Interviews and observations with participants in two British public sector projects, BBC Wales Capture Wales and the Museum of Londons Londons Voices, are drawn on to show how media technology, and particularly digital technology, are constituents of the processes of mediation which shape self-representations. It is suggested that while the digital in digital storytelling is important to the processes of mediation shaping the self-representations, it is, at the same time, absolutely beside the point.
This paper will explore such contradictions as they are raised in the processes of mediation shaping self-representations in Londons Voices and Capture Wales. It is suggested that processes of mediation are constituted through tensions in four areas: purposes; ordinary people; community; and quality. In each of these areas of tension, technology is central. The idea of tension can be productive but the term also suggests unease: self-representations are produced within unequal power relations between institutions and members of the public, and these are also the contexts in which the texts are exhibited. The conclusion draws on work on mediation and participation in order critically to engage with the claim that digital storytelling is an exciting development for democracy."
2008-1487,The Radiola and the Radiotron: Localising Global Products in Early Radio Broadcasting,High-Density Paper Session: Histories of Broadcasting,,,,Paper,The Radiola and the Radiotron: Localising Global Products in Early Radio Broadcasting,High-Density Paper Session: Histories of Broadcasting,"Radiola and Radiotron were the names the Radio Corporation of America, RCA, gave to its earliest broadcast receivers and valves. This paper investigates the use of the terms and the manufacture of the products in overseas markets, especially Australia, where a close relationship developed between RCA and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), AWA.

This relationship emerged from the global carve-up of wireless patent rights between General Electric and Marconi that occurred when RCA was formed after World War One. It helped to expand the fields of wireless activity encompassed by the Australian company and the range of its international partners. AWA eventually made much more use of the Radiola moniker than RCA itself, and attracted investment from RCA, GE and Westinghouse in the manufacturing subsidiary it established to produce Radiotrons in Sydney in 1932.

The paper provides a case study of the evolution of multinational enterprise in the media industry, especially the way technology, brands, expertise and marketing strategies were used and adapted in distant markets."

This paper is an up-to-date account of e-campaign practices in South Korea, one of the most wired (and wireless) countries in the world. On the basis of a case study of the 17th Korean presidential election of 2007, we look at how the online political climate of the country has evolved since the 16th election in 2002, the result of which was widely regarded as an ""Internet victory"". Based on results from webometrics and affiliation network analysis, we discuss to what extent candidates' uses of their campaign websites shape and get shaped by offline political dynamics and the candidates' overall campaign strategies."
2008-1489,The Reasons Why Persuasion Messages Fail,terpersonal Influence and Motivation,,,,Paper,The Reasons Why Persuasion Messages Fail,Interpersonal Influence and Motivation,"In recent years, attempts have been made to find out the indicators psychological reactance. Results from recent studies indicate that reactance can be best understood as a combination of two observable outcomes it produces simultaneously: negative thoughts and anger. But this evidence cannot be accepted as conclusive due to potential problems with inducing reactance. This study (N = 392) strived to overcome the limitations of the previous research in an attempt to unveil the exact nature of reactance with a 2 (freedom threat vs. no freedom threat) × 2 (insult vs. no insult) × 2 (high vs. low argument quality) factorial design. Results produced the best model fit when reactance was conceptualized as a mixture of perceived freedom threat, anger and negative thoughts as evidenced in the previous studies. This study, however, failed to document reactance. Instead, resistance or no attitude change after message was predominant across conditions. Potential problems with inducing perceived freedom threat was pointed out as the reason that reactance has been confused with anger."

In contrast to evasive responses to 9/11 by pundits, news media, and the officials, elements of popular culture attempt to imagine and engage the politics of the terrorism, thus their redeeming qualities. The paper focuses on culture, difference, and neo-racism in the age of Empire to explicate the politics of Otherness."

Violent television viewing by the first generation positively predicts violent television viewing by both genders in the second generation, but does not predict violent video game playing in either gender. Although males in the second generation prefer more violent television shows and video games than females, liking for violent television viewing is positively correlated with liking for violent video games in both genders. These results suggest that there are characteristic individual differences in preferences for violent media that are transmitted across generations but that depend on availability of media."

Samples of almost 400 adjudicated delinquents from detention centers and 400 comparable high school students (along with their parents and teachers) were interviewed about their current delinquent and violent behaviors and about their prior exposure to media violence (TV, films, video games) using a guided recall procedure. Results showed that both recent exposure to violent media and prior exposure to violent media in early childhood discriminated between the delinquent and non-delinquent adolescents. Within the combined sample current and prior childhood exposure were also correlated significantly with the commission of violent and delinquent acts during adolescence. Furthermore, childhood exposure and recent exposure contributed independently to predicting violent and delinquent behavior (e.g., attacking someone with a gun or knife) even when controlling statistically a variety of personality, social-contextual, and demographic factors."
2008-1493,The Relation of Ethnic-Political Violence in the News Media to Hostile Worldviews and Prejudicial Beliefs: The Importance of Identifying with Real-World Actors,Understanding the Impact of Media Exposure on the Effectiveness of International Public Diplomacy,,,,Paper,The Relation of Ethnic-Political Violence in the News Media to Hostile Worldviews and Prejudicial Beliefs: The Importance of Identifying with Real-World Actors,Understanding the Impact of Media Exposure on the Effectiveness of International Public Diplomacy,"Research on violent media largely has focused on fictionalized violence. Studies have shown that exposure to violent fictionalized media tends to produce aggression (Bushman & Huesmann, 2006); this effect is amplified by identification with aggressive characters (Huesmann et al., 2003). Less research has examined the effects on aggression of media presentations of real world violence such as war and terrorism. We will present two studies examining the link between exposure to violence in the news media and aggressive beliefs and attitudes. In Study 1, a large (N=300), diverse sample of undergraduates reported their exposure to news media stories about crime as well as ethnic-political violence in the Mideast and completed measures of aggressive beliefs. Greater exposure to news media violence predicted more hostile worldviews; these effects were modified by greater identification with ethnic actors in conflicts. In Study 2, Arab-American (n=179) and Jewish-American (n=83) adolescents reported their exposure to news media stories about Mideast violence and completed explicit and implicit measures of attitudes towards ethnic outgroups. Exposure to Mideast violence perpetrated by ethnic outgroups was associated with greater prejudice towards those outgroups. These studies have implications for understanding how violence in the news media shapes hostile and prejudicial social beliefs."

Using a sample of 133 children between the ages of five and eleven years old, this experiment explicitly tested whether knowledge of persuasive intent moderates the persuasion process in children. Participants were randomly assigned to view either a two-minute video that explained the purpose of advertising or a control video of equal length. All children then watched an episode of an animated television show embedded with commercials. Results indicated that exposure to the advertising video significantly increased childrens knowledge of persuasive intent; however, exposure to the video also increasedrather than decreasedchildrens preferences for the advertised products. Possible explanations for this counterintuitive finding are discussed."

In pursuing this objective, three types of perceived justice were deemed relevant: distributive justice, procedural justice, and interactional justice. Significant positive relationships were found between each of these three forms of justice and organizational identification. These findings are discussed, and suggestions are presented for future research concerning this topic."

Scholars agree that ethnocentrism creates barriers to effective intercultural communication. However, the research shows limited focus on the factors that contribute to ethnocentrism. This study explores three antecedents: cultural identity, self-esteem and emotional intelligence. Data collected from a self-administered survey of 419 undergraduates at two universities in the western United States was used to examine the relationship between cultural identity, self-esteem, emotional intelligence and ethnocentrism. The results indicate that high emotional intelligence leads to reduced ethnocentrism, and strong cultural identity leads to increased ethnocentric attitudes. There was no significant correlation between self-esteem and ethnocentrism. Implications and limitations of this study are discussed."

The current study examined the effects of gossip valence and humor on perceptions of gossipers and gossip targets. Specifically, 150 participants (mean age 19.29 years) took part in a 2 (gossip valence, positive or negative) x 2 (humor, yes or no) post-test only independent groups factorial experiment with credibility, trustworthiness, and likeability as the dependent variables. Results supported the notion that the type of gossip and its manner of presentation affect perceptions of gossipers and gossip targets."

However, it has been limited in that the use of a medium has always been considered independently from other media options available and from use trends occurring at the level of a population. The theory of the niche has been used to overcome this limitation by examining uses and gratification concepts in the context of media competition; but, up to this point, it has only been used to explain trends at the macro level. Through the introduction of repertoire niches, the present paper extends the theory of the niche by examining competition at the level of the individual within the resource space of his/her media repertoire. Results indicate that repertoire niche dimensions of breadth, overlap, and superiority have some predictive power over use of a medium and use relative to other media options."
2008-1499,The Right to Know About Violent Images?: The Virginia Tech Killer's Gun Points at the Viewer,Visual Journalism: Contemporary Challenges and Lessons From Virginia Tech,,,,Paper,The Right to Know About Violent Images?: The Virginia Tech Killer's Gun Points at the Viewer,Visual Journalism: Contemporary Challenges and Lessons From Virginia Tech,"On April 18, 2007, two days after the tragedy termed the Virginia Tech Massacre, NBC revealed that Virginia Techs shooting gunman, Seung Hui Cho, had sent them a package containing photographs, personal writings and a self made video  a multimedia manifesto. After NBCs originally airing, quickly the image of Cho holding guns was being seen everywhere as Chos own his words appeared on TV and online. What followed was a heated debate over journalistic ethics and the fine line between news and sensationalism. When the media confronts ethical issues regarding the showing of violent or indecent images, the media persists in claiming that the public has a right to know and their responsibility is to serve the public with this right. Traditionally the right to know has played an important role for free press on the grounds that if people know what is going on in the world they will be better informed and work to improve society. However, the right to know concept has often been confronted with questions such as: What should the public know? Who should decide what the public is to know? Are the media showing what the public needs to know?
This paper examines the medias role in the publics right to know issue in the context of American court decisions. This paper also offers an analysis of visual images which appeared in print in the front pages of the U.S. newspapers the day after NBC released the Cho multimedia manifesto. For this visual analysis this presentation will utilize some categorical typologies."

This project is composed of three studies examining same-sex infidelity in heterosexual relationships and perceptions of promiscuity in female-female sexual relations within the heterosexual dating context. Study 1A examines attributions, perceptions of sexual orientation, and relational outcomes following a same-sex infidelity. Study 1B looks at male jealousy following the same-sex infidelity of their female partners. Lastly, Study 2 explores the message that female-female kissing sends regardless of an infidelity. Overall, this project examines the role of bisexual staging on judgments of promiscuity, and what effects a new generation of bisexual chic is having on the bisexual community. With the rise of bisexual staging, female-female acts are no longer seen as distinctive indicators of a bisexual or lesbian sexual orientation. Ultimately, this paper explores the messages that female-female sexual relations sends, both as an act of infidelity and as an entity itself."
2008-1501,The Rise of Social Marketing as a Neoliberal Communication Technology,Public Relations and the Ontology of the Public Sphere,,,,Paper,The Rise of Social Marketing as a Neoliberal Communication Technology,Public Relations and the Ontology of the Public Sphere,"This paper will look at the origins and claims of social marketing that since the 1990s has become the preferred communication technology in international development, public health, and community empowerment programs. Born and bred in the U.S. marketing world, it subsequently underwent elaboration in postcolonial programs of development and health education promoted by the USAID working in family planning and child nutrition programs in South Asia, Indonesia, Africa, and Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s. Much of the value of social marketing campaigns was also confirmed by community intervention studies and antismoking campaigns in the industrialized world in the 1980s and 1990s. From the time of its inception in the late 1960s, its proponents have claimed that social marketing to be a very effective way to voice the needs of marginal populations to themselves and to make available possible solutions in the form of behavioral change. In its promotion of citizens and residents as self-acting agents and enterprising consumers who in realizing their personal goals enhance community welfare, it intersects with market-based neo-liberal policy agendas that have stressed tax cuts, the reduction and privatization of state services, the introduction of corporate management and marketing techniques into the public and non-profit sectors and the recruitment of citizens as responsible community members. Its success has been such that social marketing has now positioned itself for many communities, NGOs, and social movements as an obligatory point of access not only to the public media sphere but also to future health and development."

ICA 2006 keynote speech, this paper identifies the road not taken in social science which puts the study of the public sphere at its theoretical, methodological and empirical core. The paper recovers the American anticipation of J?Habermas? Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere by C. Wright Mills and John Dewey. The recovery of the American anticipation proceeds as a disentanglement of the main analytical elements of the classic figures which reveals their basic compatibility with mainstream social science.
This road not taken concerns media and communication studies in particular. Mills explicitly suggested this road as an alternative framework to the dominant approaches in the field: it is the comparative-historical study of public communication that should be the framework for the selection and design of studies in media and communication research."
2008-1503,The Role and Effects of Emotion in Negative Political Advertising,Political Advertising,,,,Paper,The Role and Effects of Emotion in Negative Political Advertising,Political Advertising,"This paper is based on the idea that anger, guilt, and fear have a unique impact on persuasive outcomes in political campaigns. Using a negative political advertising context, it was hypothesized that participants would report varied amounts of persuasiveness, varying attitudes toward the target candidate, and dissimilar intention to vote based on the emotion induced and the political orientation of the participant. It was also hypothesized that felt emotion would be highly correlated with persuasion, attitude toward the candidate, and voting intention. Furthermore, it was posited that participants? political orientation would affect their response to the negative message. It was also predicted efficacy would play an important role in facilitating persuasion, attitude toward the candidate, and intention to vote. The data provided mixed support for the predictions. This potential trend toward significance encourages further investigation into the unique effects of fear, anger, and guilt appeals within political communication."

Organizational participants (108 male and 102 female) completed portions of the International Communication Association (ICA) Audit and the Hermann Brain Dominance Instrument. Unexpected results showed an uncanny consensus for certain feedback preferences for all four brain-quadrant preferences and all four organizations. These striking results indicated strong support for the effect of structuration in organizational communication. In essence, the power of structuration trumps the influence of brain dominance in organizations."

The Integrative Model was used to assess the mediating effect of attitudes, perceived norms and perceived behavioral control on intentions to have sex in a sample of virgin adolescents. Results show that the constructs of the theory mediated the effect of communication with friends on intentions to have sex. Specifically, it was the attitudinal component that mediated this effect. Overall, the results suggest that conversations with friends about sex influence attitudes, which in turn influence intentions to have sexual intercourse in a sample of virgin adolescents."
2008-1506,The Role of Exposure to and Trust in Media in Determining Health Beliefs and Behaviors,High Density: Media Influences on Health,,,,Paper,The Role of Exposure to and Trust in Media in Determining Health Beliefs and Behaviors,High Density: Media Influences on Health,"Trust in media was hypothesized to moderate the effect of media exposure. The present research utilizes a national, random survey of 1,015 respondents to test the role trust in and exposure to news and entertainment media may play in the general publics health beliefs and behaviors. A structural equation model was tested using LISREL 8.1. As hypothesized, trust in media sources was found to act as a moderator between media exposure, beliefs, and behaviors. Among respondents with low media trust, news media exposure led to health-related beliefs and behaviors only indirectly. In contrast, for those with high media trust, news media exposure led directly to beliefs and behaviors and entertainment media exposure influenced beliefs and behaviors indirectly. This suggests that future research on health behaviors should consider an individuals overall media exposure as well as their trust in media."

Research indicates that the communication infrastructure and specifically, the strength of the storytelling network, influences civic engagement outcomes (Ball-Rokeach, et al., 2000; Ball-Rokeach, et al., 2001; Kim, 2003; Kim & Ball-Rokeach, 2004; Kim & Ball-Rokeach, 2006a; 2006b). Recent community building initiatives place the impetus of community change and civic engagement on the family unit (Doherty & Carroll, 2002; Erickson & Louv, 2002; Rojano, 2004). This paper places the family unit within the storytelling network and explores how family interaction is related to civic engagement. A telephone survey of 739 new immigrant Latinos in Los Angeles was used to test the relationship of family interaction on civic engagement. Regression analyses, controlling for socio-demographic factors, were used. Regression analyses, controlling for socio-demographic factors, were used. Results indicate that family interaction leads to higher levels of community belonging and collective efficacy and encourages more integration into the neighborhood storytelling network. Results also indicate gendered differences in these findings."
2008-1508,The Role of Internet User Characteristics and Motives in Explaining Three Dimensions of Internet Addiction,Predicting Use of the Internet and Social Networking Websites,,,,Paper,The Role of Internet User Characteristics and Motives in Explaining Three Dimensions of Internet Addiction,Predicting Use of the Internet and Social Networking Websites,"This study investigated how Internet user characteristics and motives predicted Internet addiction. In this study, we drew on prior addiction research in an effort to synthesize prior thinking on the current subject, and attempt to conceptualize Internet addiction in a manner that was consistent with conceptualizations of addiction in other contexts, such as addiction to substances or alcohol. The results of this study suggested that Internet addiction was manifested in different ways. Here we identified three dimensions of Interent addiction according to the intensitiy or progress of addiction; intrusion, escaping reality, and attachment. Amount of Internet use was an important predictor of two of the three manifestations of addiction identified here: intrusion and escaping reality. Three different dimensions of Interent addiction were predicted by different sets of user background characteristics and motives for using the internet. The results supported tenets of uses and gratification theory (U&G). U&G suggests that media effects are the result of media consumers individual differences (e.g., social and psychological circumstances), motives for using media, and media use (e.g., selectivity and exposure) working together. If, as the results suggest, some forms of addiction are more intense and more detrimental than others, then future research should be directed toward identifying with greater specificity exactly what background characteristics for using the Internet explain and help us understand better how addiction is manifested and which users are more susceptible to these different manifestations of addiction."
2008-1509,The Role of Issue Capacity in Agenda Setting,Top 4 Student Papers in Mass Communication,,,,Paper,The Role of Issue Capacity in Agenda Setting,Top 4 Student Papers in Mass Communication,"As an effort to elaborate on the underlying psychology of agenda-setting process, this study introduced the issue capacity concept and tested its relationships with individual-level agenda-setting effects. The findings showed that issue capacity was the strongest predictor of individuals agenda-setting susceptibility among various cognitive and motivational variables. Also, it was a strong moderator of agenda-setting effects. The effects of TV news attention were stronger in a low-capacity group than a high-capacity group. Implications for psychology of agenda setting were discussed."
2008-1510,The Role of Large Group Methods in Facilitating Communication Between Agents in Conditions of Complexity,The Use of Complexity Science in Applied Organizational Settings,,,,Paper,The Role of Large Group Methods in Facilitating Communication Between Agents in Conditions of Complexity,The Use of Complexity Science in Applied Organizational Settings,"Large Group Methods can serve as valuable tools for communicating in conditions of complexity by allowing for the creation of multiple interactions between agents which lead to emergence of new approaches and ideas while simultaneously impacting interpersonal relationships. The author shows how proper identification of context is critical to determining the appropriate application of these complexity-based approaches. Identification of communication context is based upon the Cynefin Framework (developed by Dave Snowden, with contributions by this author and others) which helps leaders understand the difference between ordered and unordered contexts and how to consider their communication efforts as fitting into one of four domains: simple, complicated, complex and chaotic. Examples of interventions with a large financial institution and a large non-profit organization illustrate the value of Large Group Methods in the complex domain. Client-consultant communication in this type of intervention is also examined."

A constructivist approach to the uses and gratifications perspective was adopted and motivated interview questions on the meanings of media use for transgender individuals. Forty-one transgender community members participated in face-to-face interviews, and results suggested two ways of looking at sense-making and mediamedia use for sense-making and media use as implicative of sense-making processes. Participants used media to make sense of feelings, sexual relations, community, and transition options. Participant uses of media revealed that media use means purposeful action and interpersonal negotiation. Limitations and extensions of the uses and gratifications framework are discussed in light of the findings."
2008-1512,The Role of Mere Exposure and Contextual Narrative Cues on Affective Dispositions Towards Mediated Characters,High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Entertainment Processing,,,,Extended Abstract,The Role of Mere Exposure and Contextual Narrative Cues on Affective Dispositions Towards Mediated Characters,High Density Session: Information Systems Issues in Entertainment Processing,"This paper proposes a theoretical extension of affective disposition theory that incorporates the mere exposure effect. In this model, mere exposure initially leads to liking for both good and bad media characters, but liking is misattributed to dislike for bad characters when contextual cues are introduced in narratives. An experiment (n = 99) provides evidence to support the model. The results suggest that the default mode that individuals bring to mediated communication experiences is to develop a positive disposition towards all characters unless contextual cues indicate otherwise."
2008-1513,The Role of News Media in Natural Disaster Risk and Recovery,Reporting on Natural Disasters in Mass Media: A Historical and International Perspective,,,,Paper,The Role of News Media in Natural Disaster Risk and Recovery,Reporting on Natural Disasters in Mass Media: A Historical and International Perspective,"This paper explores the news media's role in constructing public perceptions of risk associated with natural hazards. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of 2005 provide a useful case study for exploring the social construction of risk that results from media coverage of natural disasters. The four capital types, natural, human, social, and built, will be used as a frame of reference from which to evaluate media texts. This paper shows that natural capital received relatively less attention in the media coverage of these recent disasters. We apply the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to argue that future perceptions of risk due to natural hazards will reflect the attention paid to each capital in media coverage."
2008-1514,"The Role of Utility Values, Organizational Subcultures, and Critical Mass in Organizational Use of Communication Information Technology",Perspectives on Communication Technology and Organizing,,,,Paper,"The Role of Utility Values, Organizational Subcultures, and Critical Mass in Organizational Use of Communication Information Technology",Perspectives on Communication Technology and Organizing,"This study investigated the use of a communication information technology by organizational members in a higher education institution with mixed methods. It shows that both utility and normative factors explain unit differences in technology use. It also demonstrated the cultural foundation of the normative models explicating adoption and use of technologies in organizations. Specifically, it found that subcultures influence organizational members perceptions of utility values of a technology and norms about technology use, and their use of technology. Furthermore, this study provided empirical support to the critical mass theory. The findings suggest that task interdependence and organizational support contribute to adoption and use of a technology."
2008-1515,"The Roles of Theory of Planned Behavior, Social Capital, and Collective Efficacy: An Application to Sexual Violence",cial Factors and Susceptibility in Health Communication,,,,Paper,"The Roles of Theory of Planned Behavior, Social Capital, and Collective Efficacy: An Application to Sexual Violence",Social Factors and Susceptibility in Health Communication,"The communication behaviors of human beings as independent objects and social animals should be understood by a multilateral perspective. This study approached a sexual violence issue in two perspectives. From an individual level, the study examined the effects of the primary variables of the theory of planned behavior on information-seeking behavior. From a collective level, it tested whether collective efficacy can play a mediating variable between the two resources of social capital and civic participation in a sexual violence issue. South Koreans (N = 270) from 29 different cities participated in a Web survey. Results found that individuals attitude and perceived behavioral control significantly affected their intent to seek information about sexual violence prevention and treatment, which, in turn, led to their actual behavior. Moreover, trust and social networks significantly affected collective efficacy, which also resulted in this willingness. The results provide theoretical implications to explain: 1) what factors can affect individuals information-seeking behavior, and 2) how trust, social networks, and collective efficacy can be facilitated for the sexual violence prevention in the community. Moreover, campaign practitioners and policy-makers will be able to develop effective campaign messages and policies for the public health issue."
2008-1516,"The Rumor Bomb, Convergence Culture and American Post-politics",Communication Warfare as Social Impact: Residual and Emergent Models,,,,Paper,"The Rumor Bomb, Convergence Culture and American Post-politics",Communication Warfare as Social Impact: Residual and Emergent Models,"The close relationship between war, new media technologies, government and politics has a modern history that dates back to the turn of the last century, when rumors in the service of propaganda became essential weapons for constructing public opinion and for controlling populations to achieve elite war goals. Stuart Ewen has traced the close relationship between wartime communication strategies and the birth of public relations. Dan Schiller has argued that a close relationship between the U.S. governments military and market goals, and media technologies, created an array of network weapons that were increasingly used on a vulnerable civil society. While the internet is hailed by some as a more two-way communication technology as opposed to old media like TV, there is ample evidence that this convergence culture is also being used just as much as part of a governmental population control project, which is, as Paul Virilio has argued, anti-political or post-political in its managerial aims. This paper synthesizes these strands of scholarship and argues that the concept of the rumor bomb is a key for understanding the 20th century American mediated political culture as Pure War, a communication war on its own people."
2008-1517,The Soccer Myth: An Investigation of Soccers Imagined Potential for Social Change,Media and Social Change: Transforming Self and Communities,,,,Paper,The Soccer Myth: An Investigation of Soccers Imagined Potential for Social Change,Media and Social Change: Transforming Self and Communities,"Despite an almost total lack of empirical evidence, the belief that soccer has the potential to solve social problems remains immensely popular. This article seeks to understand this myth of soccer by drawing on survey, interview and ethnographic data about a local Amsterdam soccer tournament for cultural tolerance. It investigates how participants, organizers and the funding municipality framed the social powers of soccer and how this in turn affected the social practices they engaged in at the tournament. Results show that different actors all expected soccer to serve their own interests and that these expectations were important reasons for participating. However, their expectations were couched in a multiculturalist discourse that essentialized cultural difference and denied hybridity and cross cultural identifications. Practices at the tournament, designed to realize the potential of soccer, therefore also contributed to the reification of cultural difference. The paper concludes that the uncertainty about the effects of soccer opens up a space in which different actors can project their own desires onto the game and participate without running into conflicts over the meaning of their participation. However, this lack of conflict may also mean that hegemonic discourses are reproduced in the process, limiting the progressive potential of the myth."
2008-1518,The Social Construction of Occupational Health and Safety: Barriers to Environmental-Labor Health Coalitions,Organizational Communication and Work-Life Issues,,,,Paper,The Social Construction of Occupational Health and Safety: Barriers to Environmental-Labor Health Coalitions,Organizational Communication and Work-Life Issues,"Occupational and environmental health advocates promote the potential of alliances between workers and community members to address shared health problems resulting from industrial processes. They recognize the need to overcome job blackmail, which has successfully pitted these groups against one another by threatening job loss in the face of calls for improved standards. This strategic form of issue management strategy represents a dualism between good health and clean environments on one hand and jobs and tax base on the other. The author argues that overcoming job blackmail requires attention to the broader social construction of occupational and environmental health. The essay describes a series of dualistic constructions, in both strategic organizational rhetoric and everyday discourse, which reinforces job blackmail and impedes the development of solidarity among workers, neighbors, and environmental advocates. These dualisms polarize our views of work and environment, science, and social identity, thereby producing barriers to coalition formation. Understanding these reifications helps to build an activist agenda and identify potential resources for organizing to overcome these barriers."
2008-1519,The Social Impact of Ethnocentrism: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,Highly Ranked Competitive Papers in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,The Social Impact of Ethnocentrism: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,Highly Ranked Competitive Papers in Intercultural Communication,"In a world that is increasingly becoming a global village and countries are becoming increasingly economically interdependent, pragmatically, international understanding and cooperation has never been more important. To that end, this study examines an important element in understanding cultural differences  ethnocentrism.

Neuliep and McCroskey (1997) contend that ethnocentrism is an obstacle to intercultural communication competence and Gudykunst and Kim (1997) say that high levels of ethnocentrism impacts competence and can be dysfunctional with respect to intercultural communication as it influences the manner in which people communicate with others.

This study examines the level of ethnocentrism in undergraduate college students in the United States and China. The study used a sample of 878 Chinese and United States college students. Results indicate that the Chinese sample were significantly more ethnocentric. The results also add credence to the idea that intercultural interactions are the key to lowering the levels of ethnocentrism."

A three-month case study in the Corporate Affairs team of a UK passenger transport operator revealed the manner in which the pursuit and maintenance of power is potentially present in all public relations activities. Bourdieus framework connects individual practice with the social effects of public relations and gives practitioners and academics a new starting point for understanding the nature of power in public relations practice."
2008-1521,The Socialization of Young Adults Love Attitudes Through Family Communication and Parents Love Attitudes,terpersonal Communication in Family Relationships,,,,Paper,The Socialization of Young Adults Love Attitudes Through Family Communication and Parents Love Attitudes,Interpersonal Communication in Family Relationships,"Families talk about everyday issues from the weather to social concerns (Wood & Duck, 2006); but this study proposes that family communication also socializes about how to express love to others. A sample of 196 matched dyads of undergraduates and one of their parents completed two instruments; the Love Attitudes Scale (Hendrick & Hendrick, 1990) and the Revised Family Communication Patterns Inventory (Ritchie & Fitzpatrick, 1990), along with three open-ended questions about family communication practices. Triangulation of methods revealed a relationship between family communication and all six young adult love attitudes. Fathers love attitudes predicted five of six young adult love attitudes: Eros, Ludus, Pragma, Mania, and Agape. Free responses exposed five sources of knowledge about love, including family, friends, media, past relationship experience, and church. Results suggest that fathers may represent an understudied influence on young adult love attitudes, and that family communication may play an important role in the young adults preferred expressions of love."
2008-1522,"The State of Strategic Communications in Small Advocacy Groups: Best Practices, Challenges, and Trends",Top Student Papers in Public Relations,,,,Paper,"The State of Strategic Communications in Small Advocacy Groups: Best Practices, Challenges, and Trends",Top Student Papers in Public Relations,"This study examines the state of strategic communications in a sample of small advocacy groups that have limited resources. A survey of eleven small advocacy organizations identifies strategies, tactics and issues. Results were triangulated against industry expert interviews and other primary and secondary data. The study reveals a gap between the perception of the respondents state of strategic communications and the respondents actual implementation. Intentions are good; however they are mostly not followed through by action. The study also shows that any implementation of communications activities needs a comprehensive strategy that takes all stakeholders into account. Otherwise, communications activities target unspecified audiences with broad messages and unrelated outlets. Right now, most of the surveyed organizations, although they might be excellent tacticians, focus on media relations and neglect strategic communications."
2008-1523,The Strategic Value of Corporate Social Responsibility: A Relationship Management Framework for Public Relations Practice,"Public Relations Unplugged: Crisis, Reputation, and CSR",,,,Paper,The Strategic Value of Corporate Social Responsibility: A Relationship Management Framework for Public Relations Practice,"Public Relations Unplugged: Crisis, Reputation, and CSR","This paper places corporate social responsibility in the context of the resource-based-view of the firm, and then uses relationship management to explain the growing involvement of business in corporate social responsibility activities. It argues that the value of the public relations function to the enterprise is the capacity to aid relationship management  at a level linked to corporate strategy rather than the communications outputs perspective common to much public relations practice. In doing so, the paper views corporate social responsibility as a facilitator of relationship management and therefore, building support networks for the organization instead of viewing corporate social responsibility as a set of activities that act as vehicles for building organizational legitimacy through the management of perceptions. The paper uses a case study approach to apply the concept to a single multinational firm in the building and construction industry. The paper identifies a series of specific public relations practices used in managing relationships as part of a CSR program that result in relationships that are not easily reproduced by other organizations."
2008-1524,The Structuration of Racialized Sports Talk,Communicating for Social Impact in Public Discourse,,,,Paper,The Structuration of Racialized Sports Talk,Communicating for Social Impact in Public Discourse,"An interdisciplinary body of sport research contends that mediated portrayals of athletic conduct are contingent upon the race/ethnic identity of a respective athlete. Situating these portrayals as a micro-macro artifact of human-mediated organizing (Author[s], in press) this study theoretically assesses, and empirically examines, the micro-level manner and macro-level degree in which such racialized portrayals are constituted and regulated in sport commentator talk. Content analysis of 2,367 lines of commentary talk in the 2000 Mens and Womens NCAA Final Four basketball championship games empirically revealed how commentator discourse theoretically contributes to the promotion and preservation of racialized assumptions of athletic performance. Sport commentator talk topically diverged statistically on the athletic background of Black athletes and the favorable athletic fortune (i.e., positive consonance) of White athletes. The findings aid the exploration of understanding how racialized communication practices interactively pervade mediated portrayals of organized sport."
2008-1525,The Structure of International Music Flows Using Network Analysis,Global Flows and Networks,,,,Paper,The Structure of International Music Flows Using Network Analysis,Global Flows and Networks,"Using network analysis, this study examines the structure of international music trade flow and its determinants. International music trade data in Commodity Trade Statistics published by the United Nations are employed to describe the international music flow network. Network analysis reveals the imbalance of international music trade between the core and the periphery. Specifically, the U.S. and European countries including Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, and France are at the core, dominating international trade of music products. In addition, the findings indicate that international music products tend to flow from the developed to the developing countries. During the past five years, the international music trade network has remained relatively stable. Cluster analysis shows that the network may be classified into four geographical groups (North America and Asia, Western Europe, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe). Regression analysis indicates that a countrys economic development, the language(s) its people speak, and technological development are influential factors that determine the global structure of international music flows. The results have implications for globalization and cultural imperialism."

Specifically, the visual manifestation of three major character framesideal candidate, populist campaigner, and sure loserwas tracked across candidates and election years. The results are interpreted in the context of known campaign strategies pursued by the candidates image handlers. The studys findings suggest that the populist frame is a favorite among image handlers, but does not become all presidential candidates equally."
2008-1527,The Success of Right-Wing Populism in Danish Public Discourse,Public Discourse,,,,Paper,The Success of Right-Wing Populism in Danish Public Discourse,Public Discourse,"This paper is an analysis of the hegemonic intervention in Danish public discourse by the extreme Right in 1986. The far right?s campaign in mid-80s substantially changed the way social divisions are envisioned in Denmark, where culture, ethnicity and religion are now the signifiers of social distinctions rather than class, gender or other types of differences. What we are witnessing in Denmark and Europe is more than the normalization of racist views: it is about ethnicization of the whole field of social formations. Ethnicity/culture ? and specifically Islam ? has become the master signifier for the main controversy around which the issues of identity, globalization, and the welfare system are discussed and (re)articulated. The ?culturalization? of discourse pushed the entire political spectrum to the right.

The question is: how did a single figure, S?Krarup, a priest known for his far right views, gain almost unlimited access to discourse and achieved a long-lasting influence on the ontology of the social? A big part of the answer lies in his construction of the Danish people ? the so-called silent majority ? against a dictatorial political elite who were about to destroy Denmark. The main argument is that the moral panics around the numbers of incoming refugees created a deep hegemonic crisis that provided an opportunity for Krarup to present himself as the representative of the ?silenced? masses. The paper is a detailed analysis of the rhetorical strategies the extreme right?s intervention which granted them tremendous influence."

This paper examines the supply of over-the-air television and theatrical films in Ottawa, Washington, DC and Mexico City, and provides percentages of domestic content, content originating in other NAFTA nations, and in other regions of the world. Based on analysis of four weeks of television supply and six Mondays of theater screenings in the three capital cities, our findings show that Canada has the highest percentages of audiovisual imports, mostly from the U.S. with almost nothing originating from Mexico. The U.S., on the other hand, is the country with the lowest rates of audiovisual imports, largely from Great Britain, not Canada or Mexico. Mexico is more balanced with around 30% of imports originating in the U.S. and about 65% of broadcast television produced locally. There has been no increase in the flow of television or film between Canada and Mexico. NAFTA has not impacted the flows already in place before its signing and it has done little to reduce Canadas and Mexicos dependence on audiovisual contents from the United States."

The first event recalls the electrification of Old San Juan and the change from kerosene gas to electricity that resulted in a protest on which the street-lamps were tumble down. Secondly, the terrorist assault to the Communication Towers at Cerro Maravilla in 1978 where two young Puerto Rican pro-independence activists were killed in a police raid aimed at preventing their supposed plan. Lastly how the Internet became the primary channel to both, communicate and respond to the budget crisis that forced the government of Puerto Rico to shut down. This paper will explore how these new technologies became the target, the place and the channel to articulate socio-economical and political tensions in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico."

A new era for television has emerged in which fragmented distribution systems, expanded audience uses, and a multifaceted technological space require adjustments in fundamental theories and industrial production norms. As a member of the panel, I will offer insight on the evolution of this central cultural medium and explore the consequences of comprehensive changes in economic, technological, and industrial norms on the mediums programs and role as a cultural institution.

Amanda D. Lotz is an assistant professor in the department of communication studies at the University of Michigan. She is author of The Television Will Be Revolutionized (New York University Press, 2007) and Redesigning Women: Television after the Network Era (University of Illinois Press, 2006)."

However, we know little about ordinary peoples opinion about the effect of game-play, especially how players perceive game-play may influence their life. The current study applied the theory of third-person effect (TPE) to examine peoples perception of game effect and detected significant TPE. Self-construal and Internet self-efficacy are found to be significant predictors of TPE and the magnitude of TPE are affected not only by social desirability, social distance, but also by exposure to different types of games. Furthermore, the perceptual discrepancy regarding addictive game effect leads to support for censorship on online game, whereas the perceptual discrepancy regarding positive social game effect reduces the support for censorship."
2008-1532,The Traitor and the Hedonist: The Mythology of Motherhood in Two New Zealand Child Abuse Cases,Gendered Gazing and International Representations,,,,Paper,The Traitor and the Hedonist: The Mythology of Motherhood in Two New Zealand Child Abuse Cases,Gendered Gazing and International Representations,"New Zealand ranks among the most dangerous places in the developed world to be a child. It ranks third worst out of 27 OECD countries in terms of childrens deaths from maltreatment. Two recent child abuse cases broke through the well-known statistics in New Zealand and captured the attention of the local public. Through extensive media coverage, the public learned that the children murdered in these two cases were victims of particularly vicious attacks; all of the families were Maori, the indigenous population of New Zealand; and neither of the mothers involved were ever charged with any crime. Even though that was the case, both mothers received extensive scrutiny and coverage in New Zealand. This study employed both a narrative and framing analysis to examine how these women were constructed in the media. Building upon the work of Barnett, this analysis found two central narratives: that of the traitor and of the hedonist. In drawing upon such archetypal mythologies surrounding motherhood, the media constructed these women as deviants who did not adhere to such cultural myths of motherhood. This technique allowed for a simplistic narration of these women as undeserving of our sympathy, or, to put another way, as not possessing the qualities of a mother  the most serious crime of all."
2008-1533,The Translocal and Community Media: Translocalisation as a Mirror Image of Glocalisation,"Gaming, Technology, Community",,,,Paper,The Translocal and Community Media: Translocalisation as a Mirror Image of Glocalisation,"Gaming, Technology, Community","The notions of locality and community have a long history of interconnectedness, although more contemporary reconceptualisations of community have supplemented the once dominant structural-geographical component with non-geographical and cultural components. Combined with the emphasis on globalisation, this raises the question about the status of place, and how to avoid the risk of the erasure of places. The introduction of glocalisation has been a first attempt to strengthen the importance of the local and place, but its unavoidable emphasis on the global (as a starting point of analysis) nevertheless generates a one-sided perspective. For this reason, globalisation needs to be complemented by an inversed analytical approach is used, in which the local is taken as the point of departure, and the global is added as a second component. In this way, glocalisation gains a mirror image called translocalisation (Appadurai 1995), which allows me to focus more on the dynamics of the local and the global, using the local as a starting point.
In the translocal, a diverse mixture of media is used to fulfil the communicative needs of an evenly diverse group of communities (and not just individuals). Although the emphasis is often on the so-called new media, both old and new media can be (and are) combined to facilitate these communities to represent themselves and to participate in local and global public spaces and democracies. In order to illustrate the translocal nature of these participatory communicative events and strategies, two case studies will be analysed, one on the use of online-databases by community radio organisations, and one on community Wi-Fi."
2008-1534,The Two Professionalisms of Journalism: Updating Journalism Research for the 21st Century,ghts Into the Future of Journalism,,,,Paper,The Two Professionalisms of Journalism: Updating Journalism Research for the 21st Century,Insights Into the Future of Journalism,"The notion of professionalism figures prominently in journalists own discourses about their occupation, as well as in scholarly accounts of the practice(s) of journalism. However, the journalistic use of professionalism as an element of self-understanding as well as to establish legitimacy both have the same problem: both accounts assume that professionalism is something internal to the occupational group, i.e. largely formed within and shaped by the professional collective itself. This problem with scholarship is in turn caused by the fact that even current studies of journalistic professionalism are still shaped by the state of the sociology of the occupations (the field of study on which most studies of journalistic professionalism are based) at the time when most of the canonical works were produced (i.e. the 1970s and 1980s). As I will argue in this paper, research on journalistic professionalism has largely ignored 30 years worth of occupational sociology, and thereby missed a distinction central to understanding journalism in an era of change  the distinction between two forms of professionalism, organizational professionalism and occupational professionalism. This paper presents a theoretical framework for interpreting and analyzing the practice of journalism as an ongoing negotiation between these two types of professionalism."
2008-1535,The Unambiguous Deviance in a Fluid Reality: The Changing Frames of Homicide Reporting,Values in the News,,,,Paper,The Unambiguous Deviance in a Fluid Reality: The Changing Frames of Homicide Reporting,Values in the News,"This article analyses the changes that took place in front-page homicide news in the Finnish daily Ilta-Sanomat 1980-2000. There was a clear shift from short, factual, and official representations of homicides into descriptions of victims and offenders personalities, declarations of moral judgments, and depictions of consequences on relatives and the surrounding community. What used to be framed characteristically as a problem of the judicial system became increasingly often handled as a personal or communal matter. This article argues that one explanation for such changes is a counter reaction against the loss of community and increase of uncertainty in late-modern societies. When universal truths and values are scarce, the sense of cohesion is emphasized wherever it is still found. Condemning homicide is, in short, one of the things that still unite people."

This wasnt a coincidence but an uprising to fight the neoliberal economic policies that would be taken to a new height with NAFTA. The Mexican media attempted to reconfigure the role of the Mexican Indian in the national imaginary. Members of the EZLN were labeled transgressors of the law and pundits spent hours trying to determine who was behind it, assuming that the indigenous population was incapable of organize such an uprising on its own. Over the last thirteen years, the media have used different strategies to cope with the uninvited guests to the banquet of postmodernity: co-optation, appropriation, revisionism and exoticization."

This paper finds that the right to freedom of expression as conferring a right to government information has been interpreted by the Committee and the Commission in divergent ways.
2008-1538,The Usage of Online Vote Aids by Young People in the Netherlands,European Politics,,,,Paper,The Usage of Online Vote Aids by Young People in the Netherlands,European Politics,"In this paper, we examine the usage of online vote aids by young citizens during the Dutch national elections of November 2006. These aids consist of online question-naires that provide interactive advice about which of the 17 parties participating in the 2006 elections would best match the political preferences of the user. Current theory and research about the political communication of the young and their usage of the Internet suggests that they would be more eager users of such instruments than older voters; secondly, it would also predict that there are considerable differences among the young in their usage of online vote aids. We look into these assumptions on the basis of three waves in a six-wave online panel survey conducted before and after the elections. Using structural equation modeling, we find that age does have an independ-ent influence on using online vote aids. We also find that among the young, girls use these online vote aids more often than boys. Finally, the factors explaining the usage of vote aids, turn out to vary with age."

Evaluating Cross-National Evidence,,,,Paper,The Use of Communication Technologiesand Perceived Family Support,Do ICTs Foster Social Connectivity or Social Isolation? Evaluating Cross-National Evidence,"While a few studies have shown that the use of electronic communication tends to reduce family time and to disturb family relations, it is not clear how cellphone and Internet communication among family members is associated with perceived family social support. We investigate the association between the use of Internet and cell phone communication between parents and children on their perception of family social support. Phone interviews were collected with a representative sample of 633 Israeli families with children older than 10. Internet communication was more common for males, frequent Internet users and individuals expressing positive attitudes to technology. Cellphone communication was more frequent for young individuals, women, and higher income couples. The frequency of cellphone, but not Internet, communication was associated with perceived family support."
2008-1540,The Uses of YouTube,"Engaging With YouTube: Methodologies, Practices, Publics",,,,Paper,The Uses of YouTube,"Engaging With YouTube: Methodologies, Practices, Publics","This paper reflects on a major empirical research project undertaken in 2007 entitled The Uses of YouTube. The project combined interpretative work with tools derived from content analysis in an attempt to categorise and quantify the most prevalent uses of the site via a survey of the most popular content. It aimed to produce a large pool of data for progressively more complex and sophisticated analyses of the diversity and range of the ways in which YouTube is used. The rationale for this approach was that it would allow us to produce a relatively inclusive map of YouTube as a cultural system, and to make sense of its diversity and breadth, rather than focusing on a particular theme or topic determined in advance. At the same time, in practice the project allowed us to develop a critique of YouTubes own metrics for determining popularity. This paper reflects on and evaluates the methodology for this project and the usefulness of the results it produced, and suggests some implications for the challenges that arise when attempting to maintain the sensitivity of qualitative research methods while attempting to deal with a relatively large sample.

With a particular emphasis on Americanized modernity, I will explore Itaewon, an intervenient space which implanted the imaginary modern to the consciousness of Koreans. Specifically, I argue the intersections of identity, modernity, and desire in the production, distribution and transnational consumption of Korean popular music as a postcolonial melancholia combining sounds sampled from Japanese colonial musical heritage with sophisticated compositional techniques borrowed from America. The lyrics and style of the music reflect the re-elaboration of colonial memories, colliding in the implicit colonial memories of Korean subjectivity, in relation to imaginary articulations of Americanized modernity that takes place in the American military ghetto, Itaewon."
2008-1542,"The Veil, the Sun, and the Politics of Islamophobia",Contemporary Orientalisms: Engaging Islam,,,,Paper,"The Veil, the Sun, and the Politics of Islamophobia",Contemporary Orientalisms: Engaging Islam,"The issue of the veil has a long (and complex) history in the cultural imaginary of Western modernity and so it is imperative to consider how current discussions of the veil are framed by the contemporary socio-political climate and to examine the manner in which the concerns that arise from recent discussions are related to a much longer history of British colonial encounters with Islam and the veil. The increased visibility of veiled bodies in Britain today has stirred a response that draws on long-standing Orientalist oppositions and reworks them in the current climate of War on Terror, connecting them to parallel racist discourses about threats to British culture. Sections of the British media have presented veiled Muslim women as an obstacle to meaningful communication, and as an example of Islamic refusal to embrace modernity. Veiled women are considered to be ungrateful subjects who have failed to assimilate and are deemed to threaten a perceived homogenous entity called the British way of life. The media coverage of this issue has achieved a reversal by displacing the issue of the right to religious freedom onto an abstract, a-historical, conceptualisation of British freedom which relies on unstated assumptions about British culture as cohesive, liberal, sealed (until the intrusion of the masked other) and ultimately superior. This paper reviews the debate over the veil in Britain in the context of British foreign policy, attacks on civil liberties, the further marginalization of poor communities and the politicization of British Muslims, where the veil is an increasingly political image of both difference and defiance."

Drawing upon frameworks of image restoration from crisis communication literature and cultural repair from media studies, we examine the South Korean communitys efforts to repair a threatened cultural image. The paper explicates the cultural repair process by drawing upon Benoits (1995) framework of image restoration strategies and extending the framework to account for cultural crises. We conceptualize cultural repair as a societys attempt to restore its reputation, image, and legitimacy in the wake of a crisis. We examine media coverage in two leading South Korean publications, The Korea Times and Chosun Ilbo, to discern dominant crisis response strategies and advance implications for cultural crisis management."
2008-1544,The Visual Image and the Political Image: Finding a Place for Visual Communication in the Study of Political Communication,ymbolic Politics,,,,Paper,The Visual Image and the Political Image: Finding a Place for Visual Communication in the Study of Political Communication,Symbolic Politics,"Visual symbols have long been a central component of political communication and their importance has increase as the visual medium of television has become the dominant source of political information. Politicians understand the significance of visual images and work just as hard to construct effective sightbites as they do powerful soundbites. In short, visual images play a central role in constructing political images. Despite their central position in political communication, scholars have largely ignored visual symbols in their research. Based on a review of the available literature, this study argues that it is time for political communication scholars to delve deeper into how visual symbols function in public affairs. To that end, this paper seeks to provide a theoretical and literature base to facilitate this change in focus and to suggest future avenues of research in this area."

However, this study explores the representations of Whites as the outsider in the Other-oriented domain, specifically the Black context. Black-context films are defined as films starring a majority Black-cast and are resonant with Black cultural themes. The authors propose that White characters in Black-context films are typically bound to the construct of whiteness which includes notions of privilege, cultural voyeurism, and cultural ignorance. Analyses of three recent Black-context films demonstrate these characterizations as described by the authors."

This study examined whether children learned the target vocabulary words after viewing the episodes. Children in six daycare centers participated in the study (N = 112) from mid-July to mid-August of 2007. Three of the centers served as the experimental group and three centers served as the control group. The experimental group received eight abridged Sesame Street episodes which included the vocabulary segments in each episode. Children in the control group received eight abridged Sesame Street episodes which contained messages about health and were not literacy based. Results indicated a significant time by condition interaction. Children who viewed the episodes with the vocabulary segments knew more target words at post-test compared to the control group. Implications for closing the vocabulary gap between advantaged and disadvantaged children are discussed."

The matches of the English Premier League, the Spanish Primera Division, the Italian Seria A, the German Bundesliga and the French League are broadcasted in nearly every national TV all over the world, especially in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America. It is argued that this coverage is responsible for the growing migration of players from Africa and Latin America.

Based on an empirical study of the players in the squads of the participating clubs in the European Champions League at the seasons 2006/07 and 2007/08 the paper deals with the migration and circulation of players from Africa and Latin America to the European Top Clubs in the European Big Five-Leagues in England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. These leagues have the highest income from selling TV rights. The paper will also deal with some remarks on the consequences of the FIFA politics using the money from television to promote football in the so called developing countries. With this money young players in Africa, Asia and Latin America are trained, and when they have reached higher quality they were sold to Europe where the Clubs bought them with the money from television they received for the TV rights of the European Leagues. Therefore TV money gives way to a concentration of power in Europe, mainly in the Top Clubs of the European Champions League and the especially the clubs of the Big Five Leagues in England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

The increasing popularity of sites like MySpace or Facebook raises various research questions with regard to motives and other factors that influence the individual usage and the form of self-presentation. Previous research has mainly dealt with the related phenomenon of personal homepages and focussed on describing the self-presentation. Emerging research on social network sites within Web 2.0 first of all analyzes the motives for participating. Given the obvious importance of impression management, this study examined the so far scarcely regarded relationship between self-esteem, personality and the self-presentation on a profile within the online-community MySpace. Self-report data on self-esteem, personality and motives for participating of 107 members of the community were assessed by questionnaire and related to the specific form of self-presentation (private details displayed, number of words, number of friends, design). By comparing German and US-American users we further investigated if the self-presentation differs depending on the country of the user. The results show that it is not the motivation but the self-esteem and aspects of personality which influence how the users present themselves online. Also, the study reveals significant differences in self-presentation between the two countries."
2008-1549,Thinking About Frames: A Cognitive Response Model of Framing Effects,Understanding Personal Cognitions in the Framing Process,,,,Paper,Thinking About Frames: A Cognitive Response Model of Framing Effects,Understanding Personal Cognitions in the Framing Process,"We draw on cognitive response theory to develop a model of the psychological process that governs the effects of media frames on public opinion. First, we consider how prior beliefs and frame characteristics may shape cognitive responses to frames. We then turn to the potential role of such responses in moderating framing effects. Our model implies that citizens may counter-argue information in frames that goes against their prior beliefs, and that such counter-arguing can help explain not only framing effects but also limits of framing effects. In short, our model suggests that citizens can play an activethough not necessarily a critical or deliberativerole in the framing process. One experiment provides evidence that prior beliefs and frame characteristics jointly shape the valence of cognitive responses. A second experiment provides evidence of ""boomerang effects"" of frames on opinion, supporting the models expectation that framing effects are mediated through cognitive responses."

The findings demonstrate that they shared a lot in common in assessing the effects of the four internal constructs on ethical decisions, whereas differences were detected when they assessed the relevance of four external EDM constructs. Other differences include that the Chinese participants were more likely than the Americans to seek guidance from others in EDM. The differences show that their ethical thinking follows a prominent cultural line of individualism and collectivism as suggested in prior research."

Within organizational communication, there is currently a need to transcend the functional input-process-output framework used in small group research to study team creativity (Wittenbaum et al, 2004). In the study of creativity across disciplines, there is need for more contextualized understanding of creativity (Sternberg, 2005).

In response, this paper uses the microsociological perspective (Haragon, 2006) to study team creativity as contextualized by social and historical factors. It investigates the nature of critical inputs used for idea generation and the role of communication in influencing inputs used. This exploratory study shows that using a different perspective to study team creativity gives new insight on inputs that team members utilize during idea generation as well as new insight on the role of communication in influencing the use of these inputs."

It discusses and explores the coherence that can be produced across and between each point of the research process. The main objective is to show how I produced this coherence in my current research on new information and communication technologies (ICTs) and young adults in Montreal. My starting point is a conceptual framework for the concept of relationality. I then discuss the methodological imperatives linked to this conceptualization. More specifically, I present two research practices linked to this question. First is the researchers relationship with the participant and the practice of gathering information, which I translated by following the participants lead, both when I was present with him or her, during recursive interviews, and when I was not present, through a process called self-shadowing. Second is the researchers relationship with the material collected and the analytical work, which I translated by focusing on relation in-the-making, the work of ordering and re-ordering, and by according the same status of all material collected. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the ethical questions raised by this approach."

A total of 207 respondents completed an online survey. Larger third-person perceptions were observed among people who had more personal experience with mental illness (none, friends/family, self). Perceived effects of news on self or others were associated with expressing opinions publicly, protecting the self and others, and willingness to seek and disclose mental health treatment. In addition, among people without personal experience with mental illness, fear in response to the news, and exposure to online and print news coverage were strongly associated with stereotypes of mentally ill individuals."

Results suggest that (1) the magnitude of TPE was smaller on the feature story and the high-involvement group was smaller, and (2) the female group exposed to the feature story showed high reserved TPE perception. (3) On the behavioral intentions, females exposed to the feature story showed the most favorable responses, while the male group exposed to the feature story responded with the lowest behavioral intentions."

In the experiment that was devised to explore this suggestion, participants were asked to report in public or in private on their perceptions of how an undesirable message affected them and others. In addition, their level of self-monitoring was measured, and they were divided into high and low self-monitors. In line with the hypotheses, people showed a higher degree of TPP in public than in private. Moreover, while the public nature of the situation did not affect low self-monitors, high self-monitors reported a high degree TPP in public but no TPP at all in private. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of the current findings for research on the causes and consequences of the TPP."

Smoking bans problematize the assumed definition of the bar that cigarettes and bars go hand-in-hand and bar workers are not typical employees. Despite the public policy change, old meanings continued to inform reporters work. When new policies are approaching or being implemented that contradict cultural assumptions, reporters paradoxically legitimize the new policy and subscribe to older meanings. This study suggests that cultural frames are resilient but modifiable and that reporters perform constructivst newswork during periods in which cultural assumptions are ruptured."

In copytesting, final-format advertising is subjected to quantitative testing prior to launch, both to determine efficacy of the ads and to ensure there are no unintended effects such as creation of a false norm about the prevalence of youth drug use or a heightened desirability to use drugs. Because the copytesting measure remains static, it is possible to compare performance of individual ads and explore the specific areas that each ad is able to change. To that end, examples of advertising and their related copytest results will be provided, with a particular focus on social norming and peer perceptions of drug use."
2008-1558,Three Aspects of Scottish Advertising,cholar to Scholar: Communication History Interest Group Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Paper,Three Aspects of Scottish Advertising,Scholar to Scholar: Communication History Interest Group Interactive Paper Poster Session,"Advertising in Scotland is a rich subject for investigation, and one which has been largely overlooked. It may be approached from various disciplinary perspectives, illuminating aspects of Scottish culture and revealing more of what Fenton calls the interlocking strands that go into the making of a national identity (foreword, Scottish Life and Society: A Compendium of Scottish Ethnology, vol. 11: Institutions of Scotland: Education, ed. Holmes, H, East Linton, 2000, xv.)

Three of these strands are:

1. the history of advertising in Scotland from earliest times, illustrating how the modern mass communications in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries developed in a perceivedly UK context;
2. the creation of a new generation of Scottish agencies from the 1980s, reflecting a revived national self-confidence while questioning the future of the industry; and
3. the semiotics of Scottishness in adverting, examining the denotations and connotations of signs of Scottishness. This strand shows that advertising (like literature, music or drama) involves a dynamic between the generation, reception and interpretation of images of Scottishness. Examining this part of popular culture reveals the sophistication with which audiences can play with such images, responding to a wide range of icons of Scottishness - some of which will be mutually contradictory - and demonstrating the complexity of the popular understanding of national identity, which underpins both the images and the playfulness with which advertisers and the public engage with them.

This paper offers an initial survey of these aspects of Scottish advertising and raises questions for future research."
2008-1559,Tidings of Battle: Polarizing Media and Public Support for the Iraq War,raq War,,,,Paper,Tidings of Battle: Polarizing Media and Public Support for the Iraq War,Iraq War,"The causes and consequences of public support for overseas applications of military force is a subject of longstanding scholarly debate. Event-based explanations hold that public support for a military engagement depends primarily on its success, casualties, or the goals in a given conflict. Yet, recent research argues that perceptions concerning nature and success/failure of military engagements are often endogenous to the domestic political circumstances surrounding them, including the efforts of political and media elites to frame events to their own advantage.
In this study, we develop and test a series of hypotheses concerning media coverage of, and public opinion regarding, the war in Iraq. We hypothesize that journalists preferences lead traditional news programs to disproportionately feature members of the presidential party criticizing their president and, to a lesser extent, the opposition party praising him. Because they represent costly speech, intra-party attacks are highly credible to consumers, as is opposition party praise. In contrast, in more ideologically narrow new media outlets, we anticipate that the story choices will differ substantially.
We test our hypotheses using a comprehensive content analysis of all coverage of the war from September 2004 through February 2007 appearing on the CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News and FOXs Special Report with Brit Hume, as well as an expert survey on conditions in Iraq and national surveys of Iraq War attitudes broken down by party. We find significant differences in both the composition and impact of partisan messages on public opinion across outlets."
2008-1560,"Time, Memory, and Media Ecology",The Bias of Digital Communication,,,,Paper,"Time, Memory, and Media Ecology",The Bias of Digital Communication,"Media ecology, which has been defined as the study of media as environments, is an intellectual tradition that has coalesced largely in North America during the twentieth century. In part, the emergence of media ecology can be understood as a response to the revolution in communication technologies beginning in the nineteenth century and continuing to this day. Communication, as it has been aided and abetted by modern technology, has for the most part been associated with the dimension of space (e.g., distance, speed, and control), but Harold Innis, an early media ecologist, argues that communication also occurs over time (e.g., information storage, preservation of the cultural heritage, collective memory). Other media ecologists have also noted that we tend to focus on space and overlook time; for example, James W. Carey builds on the work of Innis in arguing that we tend to take a transmission view of communication and that we ought to also incorporate a ritual view. In general, media ecology has emphasized the need for a historical view on the study of technology (for example Lewis Mumford's ecological history of technics and cities) and communication, and with it an emphasis on the dimension of time and the human capacity for memory."

In a 2004 interview, Pittinsky, Blackboards chairman predicted, In the next 10 years online teaching and learning will be part of the DNA of educational institutions"" (Yang, 2004). Ballard and colleagues (2000, 2003, 2004a, 2004b, 2006, 2007) argue that organizational members experience with time is communicative in nature, and they developed a theoretical framework based on 11 dimensions of temporality. Ballard and Seibold (2003, 2004b) advanced workplace technologies as central communication structures in organizations, thus are rich for communication research. With an interest in instructional communication, the present study examines facultys temporal experience at work as a result of Blackboard technology adoption and implementation. Five themes emerged out of 14 qualitative interviews to describe facultys temporal experience with time surrounding Blackboard: efficient work, timely actions, flexible schedules, slow pace, and heavy time investment. I argue that the seeming contradictory findings between the first three themes and last two themes (i.e. time saving vs. time consuming) can be explained by how faculty use Blackboard as an instructional and educational technology (IET) beyond simply as an information and communication technology (ICT). The data support previous research on punctuality/ delay and job satisfaction by Ballard and colleagues. Furthermore, Blackboards nature as a collection of technological innovations deserves further research investigation in instructional communication and instructional technologies."
2008-1562,Title: Is RFID Feared? Consumer Sentiments towards RFID-Like Healthcare Communication Technology,Good Technology for Better Health,,,,Paper,Title: Is RFID Feared? Consumer Sentiments towards RFID-Like Healthcare Communication Technology,Good Technology for Better Health,"A 2007 national public opinion survey of 1404 Americans revealed variations in interest in and desirability of several mobile healthcare technologies. Many of these technologies are potentially RFID-like. The survey reported here appears to be the first nationally representative, randomly selected public opinion survey of attitudes towards mobile healthcare technology. As such, it suggests high levels of interest in emergency intervention services, but much less so in health information and monitoring services. Positive interest in RFID-like technology was positively associated with high levels of trust in others and social support. At the same time, a small minority do seen to be negatively disposed towards such applications. In those cases, the negative sentiment appears heightened when the mobile healthcare application is offered in a modality attached to the body as opposed to a more remotely available option, namely attached to a cell phone."

Based on what comparativists would call the method of difference, this paper proposes two models of political economy to compare the ideological diversity of the U.S. and Chinese media systems in relation to their larger political, economic, and cultural contexts. The U.S. media fit the hegemonic model while the Chinese media fit the propaganda model. If the radical (top-down) perspective has great emancipatory potential in advanced capitalist democracies, the liberal (bottom-up) perspective is relevant to the media under authoritarian domination. The ideological packages of elite media on the bilateral relations, along with the role of the writers and audiences, are compared. By synthesizing the authors work in the context of the general literature, this comparison aims to dissolve both totalistic and binary views that are commonly held."

This paper compared the legal actions against the two newspapers that were are the center of the global controversyJyllands-Posten of Denmark, which first published the controversial Mohammad cartoons, and Charlie Hebdo, of France, which re-published the Danish cartoons in solidarity with its Danish counterpart. This paper argues that the Mohammed cartoons controversy was a clash of establishmentalities, the culture-specific logics underpinning the recognition or non-recognition, under the law, of state religion. In Denmark, the controversy pitted a secularized constitutional monarchy where blasphemy is a crime, against the establishmentality of Islam, under which there is no separation of mosque and state, and where Prophet Mohammed and Islam are above reproach, and cannot be visually depicted. In France, the Mohammed cartoons affair pitted the secular establishmentality of France, whose major tenet is the right to blaspheme, against global Islamic establishmentality. Despite their different politico-cultural systems, courts in Denmark and France held that publication of the Mohammad cartoons was not a criminal offence. These outcomes were just as political as the demonstrations against the cartoons."
2008-1565,"To Save Comics, I Had to Destroy It: Developing Visual Language in Response to Marginalization",Visuals From an Artistic Perspective (High Density Session),,,,Paper,"To Save Comics, I Had to Destroy It: Developing Visual Language in Response to Marginalization",Visuals From an Artistic Perspective (High Density Session),"Comic books have been frequently described by scholars, fans, and their creators as a marginalized or stigmatized medium, but recent years have seen comics garnering mainstream press coverage and literary awards. Drawing from statements by comics creators and samples of experimental comics techniques, this paper examines the rhetoric and products of alternative comics creators in the 1980s and 90s who promoted saving an endangered medium through formal innovation. Following the examples and active calls to arms by prominent figures in the comics creative community, including Will Eisner, Art Spiegelman, and Scott McCloud, the 1990s in particular saw a surge in experimental techniques related to the basic conventions of the comics page, such as rethinking panel layouts, color, binding and presentation, the relation between text and image, and the presentation of comics on the computer screen. Attempting to balance between the demands of a presumed theory of comics literacy and the perceived need to change popular perception of comics, artists have stretched the formal boundaries of the form to challenge the notion of what reading a comic now means."
2008-1566,Toward Accuracy and Authenticity: Using Feminist Theory to Construct Journalistic Narratives of Maternal Violence,Feminist Theoretical Approaches: Gender/Ethnicity/Race in TV and News,,,,Paper,Toward Accuracy and Authenticity: Using Feminist Theory to Construct Journalistic Narratives of Maternal Violence,Feminist Theoretical Approaches: Gender/Ethnicity/Race in TV and News,"Contemporary journalists seek to tell stories from a neutral point of view, working to employ distance and detachment in their interviewing, information-gathering, and writing. Some communication scholars have suggested, however, that objectivity is little more than a professional myth, while feminist scholars have argued that journalists tell stories from a standpoint that neither neutral or objective but decidedly masculine. If this is true, how well does this masculine standpoint work in constructing narratives about womens lives? This paper examines the theoretical question through analysis of news media stories about motherhood and violence. By exploring how the news media presented stories about maternal infanticide, this analysis of the form and function of journalistic narratives suggests that women who harm their children are cast as deviant or failures, and such stories do little to explain the complex causes of intimate violence, little to shed light on the complex work of caretaking, and little to prevent future instances of abuse. Journalists may begin to write stories that are more accurate and authentic accounts of womens experiences as they rely on feminist methods of gathering information and telling stories, including the use of non-elite sources and the formation of partnerships with sources in constructing narrative accounts."

There doesn't currently exist a single substantial work of media studies that deals with media technology's impact on the environment. We outline the broad contours of a revisionist history to show how an ecological dimension can be added to the story of major innovations of media technology.

However, despite increased scholarly attention to ethnic media, ethnic media theory has not kept pace. This paper has three purposes. It defines and differentiates ethnic media from other media forms; it organizes and models existing ethnic media literature, and it advocates an ethnic media model that incorporates concepts from self-categorization theory and the social identity perspective. The author focuses on four self-categorization concepts (accessibility, norms, prototypes, and fit) and proposes hypotheses derived from the concepts for use in ethnic media research."

However, it has not been incorporated in public relations scholarship. This study introduces a conceptual model that integrates P-O fit, communication, sensemaking, OI, and EOR outcomes. The model illustrates the following linkages: (1) Employee communication is positively associated with P-O fit; (2) sensemaking moderates the relationship; (3) P-O fit is positively related to organizational identification; (4) organizational identification positively correlates with EOR outcomes; (5) employee communication is positively related to EOR outcomes; and (6) P-O fit positively moderates the correlation between employee communication and EOR outcomes such that when P-O fit is high, communication predicts a trusting, committed, and satisfying EOR."

How to construct a theoretical framework to understand of the impact of Digital Storytelling on the participants and their social environments in view of the empowering potential often invoked in the discourse of participatory media? In pursuit of a conceptual framework for empowerment in participatory media practice, this paper first gives a survey on both popular and academic literature on Digital Storytelling as a cultural movement. It then provides an extensive literature review on the theory and practice of participatory video in development communication, which bears considerable affinity to Digital Storytelling. It argues that only through integrating theories in development communication, visual anthropology, and empowerment theories from research in community psychology and health promotion can we holistically explicate the constructs of participation and empowerment in media practice involving nonprofessionals. The framework contributes to the field of purposeful use of media and communication for social change."
2008-1571,Towards a General Theory of Reputation Constitution,"Public Relations Unplugged: Crisis, Reputation, and CSR",,,,Paper,Towards a General Theory of Reputation Constitution,"Public Relations Unplugged: Crisis, Reputation, and CSR","In recent years, the concept of reputation has embarked upon a remarkable career both in practice and in the domain of communications. However, the expert discourse about this phenomenon is not free of certain defects and blind spots. Thus the topics covered by the PR discourse in particular have so far referred much too exclusively to private business and the debate on reputation pursued in professional circles consequently suffers from a corporate bias. The narrowing of this topic to the business sector is due essentially to the lack, up to the present, of a theory-led definition of reputation that would allow diverse types of organisation  including those outside the business sector  to be highlighted from this angle.
This paper sets out from this weak point by deriving the concept of reputation theoretically in a form applicable to all kinds of persons, organisations and institutions. It will therefore initially be presented as an evolutionary product of the process of modernisation. This leads us to making a distinction between three basic types of reputation against which the agents and organisations active in any domain (business, politics, science etc.) are assessed. We will then show that reputation assumes fundamental functions in our society in general and for persons, organisations and institutions in particular. Reputation can then consequently be introduced as a central parameter for monitoring organisational activity and public relations. Finally, we will discuss the central role played by media-broadcast communications in the process of forming reputation so that we can build on it and identify the key regularities of this process to which reputation management must adapt under the conditions of contemporary media societies."
2008-1572,Towards an Institutional and Intellectual History of British Communication Studies (Top Paper in the Communication History Interest Group),Histories of the Field of Communication,,,,Paper,Towards an Institutional and Intellectual History of British Communication Studies (Top Paper in the Communication History Interest Group),Histories of the Field of Communication,"This paper describes the early stages of a project whose central aim is to plot the development of British Communication Studies and examine the various intellectual ideas and influences which have shaped its history. The term communication is used to demarcate the whole area of study, in that it at least marks the boundaries of the accepted consensus as to what the area actually consists of at any one time.

Within that area, however, the term has been subject to what Mattelart calls semantic scattering (trans. Emanuel, The Invention of Communication, 1996, p. xiii) and the history of its usages involves reconstructing the attempts made to privilege particular meanings.

The project also aims to engage with the idea of writing communication history in a reflexive sense. This is an increasingly important area of the field, and as Nerone indicates, it is an area which reflects the academic diversity of communication:
Looked at from an Archimedean perspective, communication history displays galloping theoretical incoherence. It is as interdisciplinary and eclectic as any neighbourhood of scholarship anywhere. None of its formations weve looked to have any real promise for establishing coherence. (The Future of Communication History, Critical Studies in Media Communication 23, no.3, 2006, p. 262.)

The project therefore will also offer itself as a case study in how an intellectual activity develops sufficient critical mass to be awarded the status of a branch of knowledge, so codified that it is recognised as sufficiently distinct and prestigious to allow the awarding of degrees."

Initially, strategy perspectives developed by Whittington (2000) are analyzed and linked to public relations. The authors complement these four perspectives (classical, evolutionary, processual and systemical) with a critical perspective. The processual perspective is developed further, focusing what practitioners actually do when they act as communication strategists in organizations. Finally, the authors argue for a more reflexive epistemological social constructionist stance in research."
2008-1574,Towers as Targets: Communication Ruins in Afghanistan and Iraq,Communication Warfare as Social Impact: Residual and Emergent Models,,,,Paper,Towers as Targets: Communication Ruins in Afghanistan and Iraq,Communication Warfare as Social Impact: Residual and Emergent Models,"This paper critically examines the physical destruction of national
communication infrastructures during the recent wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq. US and international forces have fought the war not only by rounding
up Taliban, suspected Al Qaeda allies, and Iraqi insurgents, but also by
restructuring these nations' communication infrastructures. Old systems
(some of which may have even been historically funded and designed by
parties in the US) have been leveled and upgraded with new systems that
conform to US military needs in these regions. In addition, wireless and
satellite systems have been installed that enable transnational
conglomerates to redefine these spaces as 'emerging markets' and absorb
them into the global telecom/media economy. Since communication
infrastructures are often legally defined in the West as public goods, it
is important to carefully evaluate US military rationales for their rapid
destruction in the war theater. In this paper, I question whether the
designation of a regime as authoritarian warrants such an action, discuss
the unique dual status of these infrastructures as civilian and military
(even within an authoritarian regime), describe the systems that have
replaced pre-existing ones, and detail their ownership structures."
2008-1575,Traditional Content Is Still King as the Source of Local News and Information,Who Uses Local News and Why,,,,Paper,Traditional Content Is Still King as the Source of Local News and Information,Who Uses Local News and Why,"This paper is based on an analysis of survey data on media usage recently compiled by the Federal Communication Commission and a survey of Internet web sites involved in the dissemination of local news. It shows that notwithstanding the growth of alternative media (cable and Internet) traditional media outlets (Broadcast TV, newspapers and radio) are overwhelmingly the dominant sources of local news and information. Only a small percentage of the public uses alternative media as a substitute for traditional media.
Of fall respondent, 86 percent of the respondents use traditional media for local news and information and more than half of these (46 percent of all respondents) use only traditional media and no alternative media. In contrast, just 1 percent use cable or the Internet, but none of the traditional media.
Econometric analysis shows that the alternative news sources are complements, rather than substitutes. Where there are substitution effects, they are small A one-hour increase in Internet usage is associated with a decrease in television viewing of less than one and one half minutes. Use of the Internet to obtain local news lowers the probability that the respondent will use TV for local news by about 4.7 percent.
Hyper-local web sites, which have been put forward as competitors to traditional media, produce very little original content and have little traffic. The web sites of traditional media outlets have vastly larger audiences. Combining physical space and cyberspace audience, traditional media outlets have audiences that are over a hundred times larger."

John Caldwell (Professor and Chair of Critical Studies at UCLA) addresses the contribution of film and television studies to a long history of mass communication research. Graham Murdock (Reader in the Sociology of Culture at Loughborough University) has been a key theorist of the political economy of culture. Joseph Turow (Robert Lewis Shayon Professor of Communication at Penn's Annenberg School for Communication) has been a longtime proponent of organizational approaches in the study of media industries.

The question remains how good are people at detecting these microexpressions, and can they actually be trained to improve their abilities? This presentation will present data showing that Japanese business personnel, Hong Kong Police and Customs, Australian Police and Customs, can be trained to improve their abilities to spot microexpressions by 50% using a classic pre  post test design. Moreover, this training improved their confidence in their abilities, and their confidence did show a relationship to their accuracy  a result that is rare to find in the performance-confidence literature. These results are discussed in terms of nonverbal communication systems and evolution and how this type of judgment may capitalize on these human capabilities."
2008-1578,"Trait Emapthy, Transportation, Perceived Realism, and Movie Enjoyment",Advances in Media Enjoyment,,,,Paper,"Trait Emapthy, Transportation, Perceived Realism, and Movie Enjoyment",Advances in Media Enjoyment,"The current study investigates trait empathy and its contribution to audience members reception of media. Since trait empathy has been identified as a group of distinct but interrelated processes (Davis, 1996), this study examines how different dimensions of trait empathy influence audience enjoyment. Using two surveys, 143 undergraduates evaluated films they saw recently and responded to items about trait empathy, transportation, and perceived realism. The findings distinguish between the contributions of different forms of empathy to enjoyment of film narratives. Specifically, differences were found between the relationships of fantasy empathy versus affective empathy to audience enjoyment. Additionally, a positive relationship was found between transportation, perceived realism, and audience enjoyment. Implications are discussed."
2008-1579,Transactional vs. Interactive Knowledge Sharing: A Theory of Interorganizational Knowledge Networks,Current Research on Network-Based Approaches to Organizational Communication,,,,Paper,Transactional vs. Interactive Knowledge Sharing: A Theory of Interorganizational Knowledge Networks,Current Research on Network-Based Approaches to Organizational Communication,"This paper proposed a new typology of interorganizational knowledge networks, which includes two distinctive, yet related types of interorganizational knowledge networks: interactive knowledge network and transactional knowledge network.
An interactive knowledge network is based on long-term, interactive collaborative relationships among different organizations. It allows the sharing of a broad range of knowledge. On the other hand, a transactional knowledge network is based on short-term, transactional relationships among organizations, such as patent licensing, material transfer, and data transfer. Only codified knowledge is shared in such a network. While the transactional knowledge network allows the transfer of knowledge among organizations, the interactive knowledge network enables the creation of new knowledge through long-term communication and interaction.
In both networks, two organizations having ties in the past are more likely to form the same type of tie in the future. However, these two types of networks also have different evolutionary logics. The interactive knowledge network grows following the logic of preferential attachment and thus the rich gets richer, while the transactional knowledge network does not follow this logic. As a result, through time, the interactive knowledge network will become increasing centralized. Finally, in terms of their co-evolutionary logic, since different types of networks are embedded in one another, one network is the context of another network. As a result, two organizations that have one type of tie in the past are also more likely to form the other type of tie in the future."
2008-1580,"Transcending Borders, Facing Challenges: Journalists and Identity in the SaarLorLux Region",Journalism and Transition,,,,Paper,"Transcending Borders, Facing Challenges: Journalists and Identity in the SaarLorLux Region",Journalism and Transition,"Following the end of World War II, radio and television journalism was a key tool of reconciliation between former enemies France and Germany. Today, the reconciliation framework of transborder journalism is gone. Gone, too, are border checkpoints, as the Saarland, Lorraine and Luxembourg attempt to unify their transborder region. This paper looks at the potential and the challenges as broadcast journalists act as cultural mediators in the SaarLorLux region.

Through analysis of in-depth interviews, this study investigates how these journalists articulate their professional and regional identity. The historical legacy of transborder journalism in this area forms a foundation for such work. But in other respects, individual passion and commitment seem to support the existence of border-transcending journalism. This case study highlights the tension between tradition and a precarious future. These findings are valuable for understanding shifting notions of regional identity and of what it means to be a journalist."

Results indicated a significant decrease in stigma toward transgender persons from pre-test to post-test, a finding particularly applicable to the most politically conservative and religiously involved audience members. Despite the significant decrease in stigma, traditional entertainment-education theories of absorption, identification, role models, affinity, and reactance were unsupported. The Parasocial Contact Hypothesis is offered as an explanation of the results, with a suggested alteration that such parasocial contact effects not be considered reliant upon frequency of viewing or affinity measures."
2008-1582,"Transmission, Translation and Transformation: Communication of Ethical Codes in the Newsroom",High Density Session: Talking to Journalists About Journalism,,,,Paper,"Transmission, Translation and Transformation: Communication of Ethical Codes in the Newsroom",High Density Session: Talking to Journalists About Journalism,"Research into ethics in the newsroom has tended to focus on ethical theory or case studies of ethical issues through theoretical analysis of its ethical structure or deconstruction of the ethical elements of coverage of individual events. Informed by previous research into journalistic norms and codes of ethics, this study focuses on the experiences of individual journalists in the newsroom environment as they seek to perform their responsibilities in accordance with their own ethical principles and within the ethical guidelines established by the newspaper that employs them.
The approach for this study was inductive and ethnographically based. It employed three methods of data collection: preliminary survey, in-depth interviews and participant observation. Results show that when faced with ethical challenges, the journalists relied first on their personal codes of ethics and assistance and support from their coworkers and supervisors in order to resolve them. Interpersonal communication was the primary mode of transmission of ethical information, and it was enabled and supported by means of the newsroom culture more so than by the formal code of ethics of the organization.
This study indicates that the key to improving ethical norms and codes in journalism lies in the personal codes of ethics of individual journalists. The extent to which future efforts in structuring and improving organizational ethical codes at all levels of media involve and engage journalists in the process may well determine their effectiveness in reducing instances of unethical conduct."
2008-1583,Transnational and Domesticated Use of Racial Hierarchy: Representations of Blacks in Japan,Modern Transnationalisms/Modern Citizenships,,,,Paper,Transnational and Domesticated Use of Racial Hierarchy: Representations of Blacks in Japan,Modern Transnationalisms/Modern Citizenships,"This essay critically examines representations of Blacks in Japanese media, or more broadly, in Japans social context. Despite lacking a Black population, historically insular Japan has a rich and unique tradition in depicting Blacks. The representations are generally negative, and Japanese society maintains and produces these kinds of images even today. It was the West that introduced negative imaginations of Blacks to Japan, which has domesticated the images by essentializing them for domestic needs. In this regard, this essay examines representations of Blacks, or more broadly a racial ideology, in a transnational context. The essay examines not only the images themselves but also the various social conditions that have enabled Japan to maintain and produce the images. Furthermore, the essay argues that the essentialized images have a firm function in constructing modern Japans racial identity and ideology."

This panel seeks to overcome these dichotomies with a discussion of the global dimensions of their located research. Michael Curtin (Professor of Media and Cultural Studies and Director of Global Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison), Jyotsna Kapur (Associate Professor of Cinema at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale), and Serra Tinic (Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Alberta) are each working on geographies (respectively, China, India, and Canada) that are crucially important to our understanding of global production, from the roles of states and transnational industries, to the perspectives of workers and laborers in those fields."
2008-1585,Transnationalism: A Modern-Day Challenge to Canadian Multiculturalism,Modern Transnationalisms/Modern Citizenships,,,,Paper,Transnationalism: A Modern-Day Challenge to Canadian Multiculturalism,Modern Transnationalisms/Modern Citizenships,"This paper examines some of the primary challenges of situating a multicultural policy framework within the transnational sphere. If multiculturalism gives expression, at least partially, to a politics of recognition which animates identity (Taylor 1994), it becomes important to examine the incipient shortcomings of this policy framework within transnationalism. As a nation-building tool, multiculturalism situates ethnic and racial minorities in relation to a dominant national identity, and subsequently shapes the parameters of cultural inclusion and recognition within a given society. In Canada, for example, official multiculturalism is emblematic of a discourse that is bound up with a celebration of cultural heritage and tradition. While the legacy of multiculturalism endures, there are new questions being asked about its posture and viability in the face of transnationalism. Specifically, I ask the following questions: What are the limits of Canadian multiculturalism in transnationalism, and is this an out-dated policy framework amidst todays globalized and transnational world? I advance this argument through an analysis of three key dimensions that I maintain constitute and characterize the dominant features of transnationalism: the institutionalization of global capitalism; the transformation of the public sphere; and the diasporization of new publics. These dimensions provide an interaction that influences multiculturalism and the struggle for recognition. At the core of this analysis lies the understanding that while multiculturalism has its own corresponding policy embodiment within Canada, its respective policy impacts stretch beyond borders into the transnational sphere. A critique of the actual policy itself would constitute a very different intervention."

It has been argued that the rise of transnational television lies at the heart of the current regional and global reshaping of media industries and cultures worldwide (Chalaby 2005:1). Following the call for studies that turn away from speculative theory and argument-by-anecdote towards a more empirical consideration of media institutions as one of the contested interfaces between national and global forces (Curtin 2005:159), this paper investigates the corporate strategies of Viacom-owned Nickelodeon currently beamed into more than 500 million households targeting kids. Focusing on Nickelodeons operations in the South Pacific region, more specifically in New Zealand, can provide a particularly revealing case study in the dynamics of transnationalization that defines television markets today. The paper concludes that global childrens television, in comparison to other types of transnational television, is still highly standardized and thus seem to reinforce the US hegemony of global television culture rather than challenge it. Nickelodeon in New Zealand, especially when compared to Australia, represents a revealing and complex case which underscores the domination of the global in the globalization/regionalization/hybridization processes media institutions face today."

First, it considers the change in the perceived source of value of the music commodity going from tangible to intangible formats. Then, it tracks the trade-offs made by music consumers who exchange purchasing recordings for subscribing to music download and streaming services, and notes the imbalances in favor of the intellectual property rights owners. Then, it analyzes the features that appeal to the collectors psyche enough to capture the collector into a digital enclosure. It concludes with an analysis of the incommensurability between the activities of the music collector and those of the music service user.

However, since communication via Internet is used by more and more citizens the question of trust in public Internet communication becomes crucial. The paper will address the theoretical and methodological consequences of these developments. It is argued that trust primarily refers to certain social actors. Thus, special techniques of communication (print, TV, Internet) are of secondary relevance when describing trust relationships. Theoretically, it can be assumed that, while the traditional news media will also use the Internet as a platform for mass communication, new forms of public communication emerge, e.g. peer-to-peer communication. How does this new environment change trust evaluations of recipients (communication between anonymous actors, casual and unique meetings)? Methodologically, the Internet provides researchers with new research tools, as for example reputation indices."

I am interested in how individuals and groups constitute and communicate their identities through globally recognizable brands, particularly when these identities are bound to concepts of revolution and radical politics. I will begin by discussing the economic and cultural ramifications of globalization. Through his frame, I will describe the market logic of branding and how it facilitates the production of identities and communities. Then, using a case study of the global brand of Che Guevara, I will explore how symbols of revolution have become markers by which North American youth associate themselves with radical political identity, and whether this can constitute an authentic politics. Finally, I will turn to how global social movements can harness this branding power for their own projects."

Technlogical Change and Popular Communication","Hip-hop culture began with a DJ manipulating records to compose music, a style that grew into a profitable commodity. The music, which started as means of identity formation, community building, and dealing with marginalization, has been appropriated into the masses (what we call rap) and turned into a corporate means of control. This study is a critical historical analysis of turntablistsDJs who use a turntable as a musical instrumentand how the subculture uses the medium to subvert dominant ideas of musicianship and technology. This research also describes vinyl record manipulation from John Cage to Jamaica to the South Bronx and into turntablisms modern state. By using the hip-hop commodity (vinyl record) to compose, this study looks at how modern turntablists reappropriate, thus decommodify, the essence of hip-hop culture as originally conceived by the early hip-hop DJs. In the process turntablists recapture many of hip-hops original intentions and functions."

By engaging with a structural critique of television, feminist television criticism moves beyond the interrogation of stable texts of narrative storytelling, whether they include individual episodes, a season, or an entire series of a particular program, nor is it relegated only to the organization and a strict reading of the business, of television. Rather than evaluating the multiple and ongoing narratives for the representation of gender, sexuality or interpersonal power dynamics, feminist scholars need to consider the structure and organization of television itself as it has evolved into a patchwork of niche audiences as exemplified by the particular phenomenon of programming for woman as evidenced by Oxygen Media."
2008-1592,TV Freedom and other Experiments for Advancing Liberal Democracy in Iraq,Communication Warfare as Social Impact: Residual and Emergent Models,,,,Paper,TV Freedom and other Experiments for Advancing Liberal Democracy in Iraq,Communication Warfare as Social Impact: Residual and Emergent Models,"After September 11, 2001, the Bush-Cheney administrations campaign to overthrow Saddam Husseins regime was rationalized in terms of advancing liberal democracy which would free the Iraqi people (from their past), empower citizens to govern themselves, and thus contribute to a political modernization (based on the model of the United States). This paper considers how exporting or advancing democracy in Iraq has occurred in part through the Coalition Provisional Authoritys funding of the Iraqi Media Network and its first TV channel, Al Iraqiya., and subsequently the CIAs funding of Al-Hurra--The Free One or TV Freedom. The initiatives were supposed to help modernize a country where citizens had been prohibited from owning satellite dishes that could import foreign broadcasting. This paper discusses Al Hurras relation to residual and emergent U.S. models of propaganda and information warfare, devoting attention to Al Hurras direction by the Broadcast Board of Governors (formerly the US Information Agency), its programmings investment in reality TV (e.g., Al Hurras Terrorism in the Hands of Justice), and these projects relation to neo-conservative and neoliberal reasoning about civic empowerment through public-private partnerships. The paper asks to what extent Al Hurra is a significant departure from previous U.S. initiatives that have conceived of broadcasting as fundamental to liberal, democratic citizenship and publicsand thus to waging peace."

Technlogical Change and Popular Communication",,,,Paper,"""TV or Not TV"": Bloggers Discuss Television Nonusage","New Technologies, New Texts? Technlogical Change and Popular Communication","In contemporary society avoiding media has become a challenge. If exposure to media was once confined to a number of well-defined spheres and moments in the day, today the media is omnipresent and continuous, requiring no disengagement or resumption. The ubiquity and convergence of the media has transformed the act of turning it off from a routine unmarked moment into a conscious effort and a personal statement. Not watching now signifies the adoption of a media avoidance lifestyle, a lifestyle which is flexibly defined and interpreted depending upon community and class context. In this paper, we seek to gain insight into this cultural and technological period of transition through an examination of individuals that make the effort to remainto some extent and in relation to some media unplugged. We approach contemporary media saturation not by studying those who partake in it, but rather through a study of those who negotiate media in a critical fashioneither by setting limits (no cable) or through complete avoidance of television. This paper is part of a larger work-in-progress that explores patterns of non-use of communication media. Here we focus on bloggers who reflect on their discontinuance, rejection or limitation of television viewing. Viewing their discourse as a constructive practice, we analyze how they define television as a problem, the solutions they propose, and the consequences of adopting these solutions. The analysis highlights the ways in which bloggers draw upon lay theories of communication to explain their media avoidance practices."

Data from 1,552 participants in the 2004 China Health and Nutrition Survey were analyzed. Results indicate that TV watching and eating snacks while watching TV were related. High TV watchers had higher odds (OR = 1.38) of eating snacks while watching TV than low TV watchers. Paying attention to TV commercials was related to all snacking behaviors. Children who paid attention to commercials had higher odds of requesting snacks seen on TV (OR = 3.39), and higher odds of buying snacks seen on TV (OR = 2.62) than those who did not pay attention. Increased TV watching and childrens attention to commercials for snacks may be factors in the growing obesity problem among children in China."

In this paper, I will attempt to show how popular music had become a dilemmatic narrative of the fascination and revulsion regarding not only adaptation of Americanized modernity but also concealed strategy of forgetting Japanese colonial memories. With a particular consideration on the postcolonial interstice in time and space between two empires through popular songs, I will explore on how the narrative of exotic music genre with the discourse of Japanese Empires Southern territories called Nambang, had ironically interwoven to reinforce the Japanese militarism and consequently bonded to resuscitate Western fantasy and sustain the continual colonial submission to U.S. occupation during Total War and after the liberation, The paradoxical coexistence of popular music genres especially concerning reappropriation of elegiac tunes from Enka(Fox trot) and adoption of blues and jazz from American military subculture had transformed as a transferential narrativization of serving political logics of hegemony. Popular music as post traumatic symptom of colonial era during this ontological on-going submissive process of colonial subjectivity from Japanese empire to the U.S. military government control enacted as unconscious narrativization of the way in which colonial subjectivity had continually subordinated during different colonial sovereignty as an efficient psyche operation."
2008-1596,Tying the Knot?: Couples Deliberations Regarding Legally Recognized Same-Sex Marriage,Queer Intimacies and Public Space,,,,Paper,Tying the Knot?: Couples Deliberations Regarding Legally Recognized Same-Sex Marriage,Queer Intimacies and Public Space,"This study examines same-sex couples' attractions to marriage, obstacles that challenged them when considering marriage, and the ways they overcame such obstacles. Participants (N = 263) were members of same-sex couples that were either legally married or engaged to be married. A web-based survey asked participants to describe the discussions between them and their partners when deciding to marry. Inductive coding identified categories and themes among the participants' attractions and obstacles to marriage, and strategies for overcoming obstacles to marriage. Same-sex couples were attracted to legally recognized marriage as a means of gaining civil/public and social network recognition for their relationship, and for personal reasons. Couples considering marriage were challenged by the civil/public limitations of marriage, social network disapproval, and practical and symbolic issues with weddings and the institution of marriage. Strategies to overcome these obstacles varied in directness. The results contribute to a better understanding of committed same-sex couples as their relationships transition to institutionalized status."
2008-1597,Types and Sources of Memorable Breast Cancer Messages: Their Impact on Prevention and Detection Behaviors,High Density: Media Influences on Health,,,,Paper,Types and Sources of Memorable Breast Cancer Messages: Their Impact on Prevention and Detection Behaviors,High Density: Media Influences on Health,"It may seem obvious that communication targets are able to recall some messages much longer after initial exposure to the message than others. These memorable messages are remembered for long periods and have the ability to influence behavior when targets recall them from memory long after initial exposure to the message. It is not immediately obvious, however, why only some messages become memorable. Knowing which messages become memorable can improve the long-term efficacy of future breast cancer outreach. To this end, 359 women completed an online survey about memorable messages they recalled about breast cancer. Most women (60%) recalled a memorable message, described it, identified its source, and noted whether it had resulted in prevention or detection behaviors. Four categories of messages emerged: detection (37.3%), awareness (30.9%), treatment (25.8%), and prevention (6%). Furthermore, five categories of sources emerged (media (35.5%), friends (22.2%), family (21.6%), medical professionals (15.2%), and others (5.5%)). The media were a major source of all four types of messages although family members, friends, and the medical community were major sources for certain of these message types as well. Furthermore, memorable messages originating from medical professionals were substantially more likely to motivate detection behaviors than prevention behaviors. Overall, this research demonstrates that not only do message type and source both play roles in determining message recall they also both play roles in determining how the memorable message will impact behavior."

By developing insights into this phenomenon, the study aims to shed light on the paradoxical nature of Buddhist organizing or what some scholars (Keown, 2000; Queen, 2000; Queen & King, 1996; Queen, Prebish, & Keown, 2003) call ?engaged Buddhism.? In turn, it seeks to draw lessons from a form of organizing that has only recently started to receive academic attention by scholars interested in questions of organizing (see Kernochan, McCormick, & White, 2007; Weick & Putnam, 2006)."
2008-1599,Uncertainty Reduction Over Time in Initial Stranger Interactions: A Social Information Processing Theory Approach,Managing Online Acquaintances,,,,Paper,Uncertainty Reduction Over Time in Initial Stranger Interactions: A Social Information Processing Theory Approach,Managing Online Acquaintances,"Social Information Processing Theory (Walther, 1992) suggests that people can overcome limitations of communication channels to accomplish their communication goals. One common communication goal that has been examined from this perspective is uncertainty reduction (Tidwell & Walther, 2002; Westerman & Tamborini, 2006). However, past research in this area has focused on cross-sectional studies. The current study examines the uncertainty reduction process over time in initial stranger interactions. Drawing on SIPT, the current study examines both uncertainty levels and the use of interactive uncertainty reduction strategies in ongoing face-to-face (FtF) and computer-mediated (CMC) interactions.
In order to address these questions, 60 strangers interacted in male-female dyads for fifteen minutes in one of two modes: face-to-face or using instant messenger. After they interacted, each person was asked to report their uncertainty levels toward their partner for each minute of the interaction retroactively. The interactions were also coded for the number of interactive uncertainty reduction strategies used in each minute. The data showed that although uncertainty started higher in CMC than FtF as expected, it followed similar patterns of reduction over time in both conditions, which was not expected. IURS use followed hypothesized patterns in both CMC and FtF, however. These findings are then discussed, as are limitations and avenues for future research."
2008-1600,Understanding Audience Involvement: Conceptualizing and Manipulating Identification and Transportation,"Advances in Media Involvement, Identification, and Engagement",,,,Paper,Understanding Audience Involvement: Conceptualizing and Manipulating Identification and Transportation,"Advances in Media Involvement, Identification, and Engagement","This study describes an experiment in which different types of information about the hero of a film clip and the outcome of the story were provided to viewers and the effects of such variation on transportation and identification were tested. Results show that the valence of information about the hero affected the level of identification with the hero (but not the level of transportation), and that when viewers were provided information about future, rather than past deeds of the character, their transportation was increased (but their identification remained unchanged). The experiment thus provides evidence of conceptual and empirical differentiation between these two processes and clarifies how they relate to each other. We then test how each of these processes relates to enjoyment. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and methodological contribution to the study of involvement."

Results from a random-sample Web-based survey of 1,055 students revealed differences between content consumers and non-consumers, and between content creators and non-creators of YouTube when respondents were analyzed according to their demographic profiles and use of other Internet activities, including using Internet, reading news online, reading blogs, using online albums, using podcasts, and creating podcast content. They were also analyzed by news consumption, including digital subscription, online news seeking and traditional media use. The results of open-ended questions of motivation for consuming content and creating content on YouTube showed that content consumers use YouTube mainly for personal fulfillment and information seeking, while content creators make videos mainly for personal fulfillment."

Scholars in a range of countries have established that actors in the GSJ movement tend to be diverse in terms of their ideological, tactical and strategic commitments, and these differences have important implications for the trajectory of the GSJ movement as a whole (Chesters and Welsh, 2005; Bennett et al, 2006). Our data suggest that it is important to consider both similarities and difference amongst groups to better understand their organizing processes. Accordingly, we first discuss how our study corroborates the existence of diversity in the form of specific tensions (such as those between anarchist and Marxist groups); and generalized tensions, (such as those between feminist and queer groups and other groups in the movement). Second, we outline how our data also reveals some important commonalities amongst these groups, in the form of some organizing tactics, immediate objectives, as well as generalized opposition to neo-liberalism and neo-conservatism. Finally, we discuss specific strategies and tactics that groups have developed as they organize their relationships around these differences and commonalities. In concluding, we use these findings to engage in some theoretical speculations about diversity in the GSJ movement in Aotearoa/New Zealand."

This study is an attempt to demonstrate that risk perception has multiple predictors in different sexual scenarios  main versus casual sexual relationships and that risk perception itself needs to be understood better so that it can be more effectively employed in theory guided safer sex interventions in different relationship contexts. In a sample of 1489 young adults in this study, main sexual relationships were found to be less risky than casual sexual relationships with regard to contracting an STD or HIV. Gender, past condom usage, race and sensation seeking emerged as significant predictors of perceived risk of contracting an STD or HIV in main sexual relationships. In the case of casual sexual relationships gender and past condom usage continued to be significant predictors of risk perception, and decision-making and number of sex partners were also found to be significant but race and sensation-seeking were not. Implications for message design are discussed."

This paper reports on a collaborative study, undertaken in partnership with a nonprofit community healthcare organization to promote the use of reproductive health services by low income African American women in a small-town community. The purpose of this study was to lay the groundwork for designing more effective communication initiatives to promote the use of the organizations services by uncovering impediments to the communitys use of the center. Findings regarding intersections of organizational identity (as socially constructed within the context of this community), individuals social identities, and privacy are presented. Implications for future communication on the part of the organization with the community are identified."

The results of this study revealed that partner and relationship uncertainty were positively associated with avoidance. Moreover, analyses revealed that communication efficacy was a mediating variable that linked partner uncertainty and avoidance as well as relationship uncertainty and avoidance. These findings suggest that communication efficacy may have important effects on avoidance following a partners deception and may help explain how partner and relationship uncertainty affect avoidance."
2008-1606,Understanding the Consequences of Trust. The Effects of Trust in News Media on Trust in Politics.,Media Trust and Media Credibility: Shaping Our Understanding of Two Key Concepts,,,,Paper,Understanding the Consequences of Trust. The Effects of Trust in News Media on Trust in Politics.,Media Trust and Media Credibility: Shaping Our Understanding of Two Key Concepts,"Trust in media and trust in politics are two highly intertwined mechanisms that are of utmost significance to modern societies. Mass communication scholars agree that political actors are always interested in the transmission of their trustworthiness and credibility. However, since this transmission is a mass-mediated phenomenon, trust in politics can not evolve when there is no trust in news media. This idea is tested with survey data on the Swiss debate about asylum policy in 2006. Path analysis shows that both newspaper and television trust increase political trust which in turn increases political participation. However, only newspaper trust explains learning from the news. The results are discussed in terms of their importance for trust and credibility theory in mass communication research."

Construed as transformation perspective or posttraumatic growth, these health outcomes have received increasing attention from investigators. However, little is known about these outcomes in cultural settings outside of North America, or the basic processes that contribute to positive changes. The current study examined communicative dimensions and cultural representations of transformation perspective among cancer patients receiving active treatment in Western India. Specific dimensions of transformation perspective, processes of change, and potential determinants were explored using narrative data. Individuals high in transformation perspective described changes in life review, life satisfaction, forgiveness, spirituality, and altruism. Changes were experienced as gradual and effortful. Among the factors associated with growth were purposeful reflection, efforts to make sense of the illness, to find benefits, and to use social support. Results provide an initial picture of transformation perspective among Indian cancer patients, and point the way toward further research."

At the same time, the percentage of people naming unemployment as the most important political issue increased by 17 percent during the campaign. The purpose of this study is to analyze individual level agenda setting effects in the 2006 Swedish National Election campaign. Apart from being one of the first agenda setting studies conducted in Sweden, this study builds upon a panel survey with 1007 respondents making it possible to impose strict control of the causal relationship between the media and public agendas. The overall findings show that agenda setting effects were indeed present. Furthermore, these effects did not depend on possible contingent factors such as education and the degree of political involvement among the respondents."
2008-1609,Unintended Effects of Public Health Communication Campaign Branding,High Density: Message Design Research,,,,Paper,Unintended Effects of Public Health Communication Campaign Branding,High Density: Message Design Research,"Past research has identified that the boomerang effects of exposure to the anti-drug messages of the U.S. National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign could be effectively accounted for by a meta-message explanation (Jacobsohn, 2007). That is, the effects of exposure on marijuana use outcomes were mediated by perceived descriptive norms, specifically perceived peer marijuana use prevalence. Interpretation of such findings focused on the total aggregate effect of ads in the campaign and an overriding message of normative use. In the study at hand, the Campaign branding was speculated to be one reason that the higher levels of ad exposure may have produced stronger beliefs in peer prevalence as the aggregate effect was strengthened by the linking between ads by the brand. This paper investigates this speculation by examining if the Campaign's exposure effects on perceived descriptive norms were contingent on Campaign brand recognition. To test this question, interaction analyses were conducted with longitudinal data. From September 1999 through June 2004, three nationally representative cohorts of youth aged 9-18 years living in households in the United States were each surveyed in-home four times. The sample size ranged from 8117 in the first round to 5126 in the fourth round (65% overall response rate, with 86-93% of re-fielded youth interviewed in subsequent rounds). Lagged regression analysis offered evidence supportive of the hypothesis. Implications for the appropriate use of public health brands and potential unintended effects of such branding are discussed."

This paper represents the first part of an analysis comparing Habermasian public sphere theory and the Islamic textual sources, the Quran and the Sunnah. Specifically, this paper aimed to look for evidence of whether or not the Habermasian idea of universal inclusion exists, according to the Islamic textual sources, in an ideal Islamic social system. This studys textual analysis of the Quran and Sunnah sought to uncover the position of the Islamic sources vis-à-vis race, nationality, social class, gender, sexuality, and religious identity. Results from the study suggest that there is considerable overlap between the Islamic sources and Habermasian universal inclusion, but that there are also significant differences. Islams assertions that race, nation, and class are not justifiable bases for superiority, of spiritual equality between the genders, and freedom of religion and conscience for non-Muslims are all consistent with Habermasian ideals. The Islamic sources marginalizing of some voices, however, represents a key area of difference between Habermasian and Islamic ideals."
2008-1611,Unknown Knowns: Soldier Photography and the War on Terror,The Ethics and Aesthetics of Authenticity in News Images,,,,Paper,Unknown Knowns: Soldier Photography and the War on Terror,The Ethics and Aesthetics of Authenticity in News Images,"In the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq American photographers have had the opportunity to be 'embedded' with military forces near the front lines, leading to speculation that photographers would have access to the raw realities of warfare. However, photographs from these conflicts have been characterized by a narrow range of recurrent motifs and scenarios. More often than not, the embedded system mirrors and mandates the rationality of perception promoted by the state in its geopolitical visions of a globalised war on terror. In contrast, we find photoblogs that are producing alternative imagery of the war in Iraq, including imagery posted by serving US soldiers. This paper considers the conventions and functions of these images, through an analysis of the distinctive visual language of the soldier's photoblogs, in which genres of institutional, touristic, pornographic and war photography are blended to produce fascinating (sometimes disturbing) representations of their fears and desires."
2008-1612,Unplanned Obsolescence: U.S. Participation in Redundant Multilateral Copyright Agreements,"Comparative Copyright: Classrooms, Pornography, and Treaties",,,,Paper,Unplanned Obsolescence: U.S. Participation in Redundant Multilateral Copyright Agreements,"Comparative Copyright: Classrooms, Pornography, and Treaties","This paper analyzes the history of international copyright protection, and the emergence of several overlapping and redundant multilateral treaties administered by a variety of international organizations. In addition to the longstanding Berne Convention and the much more recent Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the United States also continues to observe various regional or multilateral agreements including the Buenos Aires Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention. In light of newer copyright agreements forged by the World Trade Organization, some of these overlapping treaties have become redundant and obsolete, but are still observed by the signatory nations. This paper explores the ramifications of continued adherence to outdated international copyright treaties, and how the resulting confusion and redundancy impacts the rights of creators and the trade in intellectual property items in the modern environment."
2008-1613,Uploading Dissonance: YouTube and the US Occupation of Iraq,raq War,,,,Paper,Uploading Dissonance: YouTube and the US Occupation of Iraq,Iraq War,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze and discuss the use of YouTube by the United States military for the spreading of pro-American messages regarding their presence in Iraq, and, at the same time, to examine the presence on the same YouTube system of a large number of video clips showing members of the United States military engaged in extremely violent, anti-social activities. That these juxtaposing images of coalition forces in Iraq exist on the same video-sharing forum forces us, I will argue, to reconsider traditional notions of how propaganda is produced, distributed, and received. In addition, the presence of dissonant material on video-sharing sites such as YouTube should lead us to consider the dual nature of the site: as a location containing both mainstream, hegemonic material, and alternative, small-scale, counter-hegemonic clips. This paper is intended as a discussion document on the nature of military propaganda on YouTube in relation to previous literature on public diplomacy, propaganda, the military and video-sharing sites, and as a first step toward reconsidering the nature of propaganda in an era of open-access video-sharing and simplified production and distribution."

Support for this argument is made by reviewing the current and near-future state of information and communication technologies and services, by examining the implications for development of increased urbanization in the global South, and by considering both well-established and promising new scholarly theorizing relevant to ICTs for economic development. Research questions and programmatic applications arising from the new perspective for development communication are offered with particular emphasis on the impact of urban entrepreneurs working in the informal economic sector."
2008-1615,Urban Space and Immigration Discourse,Communicating for Social Impact in Public Discourse,,,,Paper,Urban Space and Immigration Discourse,Communicating for Social Impact in Public Discourse,"Recent communication scholarship has revealed how specific places can construct some identities as more powerful than others or can work to hide social difference and inequality. This paper shows how communication scholars can impact the public discourse on global mobility by analyzing urban space. After examining the increasing standardization of public space, the essay summarizes events surrounding immigration reforms proposed by the U.S. congress. These reforms sparked both massive protests for immigrant rights and a nativist backlash. By describing the role immigrants take in tourist spaces often considered homogenous, I will show how the messages conveyed in them go beyond the bland conformity of chain stores. Indeed, these spaces can be understood as playing a role in the debate on globalization and its consequences."

This exploratory study examined whether a computer-mediated health literacy program could help enhance older adults medication adherence and reduce their adverse self-medication behaviors. Results of this study were used to help create the release version of this program for a subsequent large-scale field trial. Specifically, the study tested the usability of a touch-screen enabled Personal Education Program (PEP). Findings showed that older adults rated the PEP system usability, system information and system-use satisfaction at a moderately high level for Prototype-1 and at an exceptionally high level for Prototype-2. A 201.91% reduction in interface errors and a 31.08% decrease in interface time were also found between the two trials. This participatory usability design was highly successful in tailoring its program interface design to accommodate older users to enhance their health communication and technology use efficacy."

IT and business are conceptualized as different occupational communities, with different understandings of their work. Our focus is on the importance of knowledge sharing between these occupational communities in reaching mutual understanding of a shared situation, and the influence this has on the perceived performance of the IT organization. The focus in this study is on the level of social capital that exists between these different occupational communities, and how this influences the extent to which knowledge is shared between them. A case study that combines qualitative and quantitative methods points out that a lack of social capital (structural, relational as well as cognitive) can serve as an explanation for the often problematic relationship between these communities. Even if factual information on systems design, prototypes and experiences with information systems is exchanged, this does not mean that any improvement in this relationship has been established. The central role of relational social capital, both in the quantitative and the qualitative findings, emphasizes this: relational social capital and knowledge sharing are seen as intimately related, and together exert a significant influence on the IT organization?s perceived performance. The IT organization, we can conclude, is perceived as performing better (both by itself and by the business) when high levels of social capital exist between the different occupational communities, and when knowledge is actively being shared between these communities."

I extract the metaphors, vocabularies, and cultural lenses through which the French, Brazilians, and Americans judge acts of political violence, as well as the drawing of moral and social boundaries between the us and the them employed in order to legitimize or delegitimize the events of 9/11. Two contrasting standpoints on political violence are elucidated. Political violence can be seen as a form of action that upholds a binary framing of moral order in which strong and weak actors struggle. By contrast, terrorist violence can be seen as inherently unjustifiable, as it necessarily results in human suffering."
2008-1619,"Usefulness, Ease of Use, Attitude, and Their Interaction Effects on Usage Intention of Three Electronic Mail Systems","Blogs, Chats, E-Mail, and Wikis",,,,Paper,"Usefulness, Ease of Use, Attitude, and Their Interaction Effects on Usage Intention of Three Electronic Mail Systems","Blogs, Chats, E-Mail, and Wikis","The technology acceptance model (TAM) predicts acceptance of user applications by specifying casual relationships among several beliefs and attitudinal constructs that mediate the influence of external variables on usage intention. Studies on the TAM have assumed the effects of its constructs on behavioral intention to be linear in nature. While previous studies have obtained good results with this restriction, such a restriction has not been formally rationalized. Further, the TAM studies generally have treated every setting in agreement with a one-choice situation, where users are not given alternative technology to choose from. In situations where alternative technologies exist, results and findings may differ. This paper seeks to evaluate the main and interaction effects in the TAM in situations with three alternative electronic mail systems. A questionnaire survey is administered to more than 250 subjects. Findings show that interaction effects do play a significant role in predicting user acceptance. Further analyses also demonstrate that the TAM is applicable for alternative technologies. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Through a telephone survey of chiefs, presidents and tribal leaders (n = 206) registered with the National Congress of American Indians and a random sample of adults in US households (n = 496), results reveal that Native Americans are more offended by sports teams employing American Indian imagery as well as more change supportive than is the general public. Investigation of how demographic characteristics influenced perceptions show that while age and education level have little influence, political party affiliation does affect opinions with those voting Democrat viewing the teams with American Indian names, logos, and mascots as most offensive and in need of change. Finally data suggest that the Washington Redskins name is most offensive across both sample groups."

The groups are: responsive (high risk, high efficacy), avoidance (high risk, low efficacy), proactive (low risk, high efficacy), and indifference (low risk, low efficacy). These groups are hypothesized to differ from each other in their self-protective motivations and behaviors. This study tested the central propositions from the RPA framework among a group of immigrant Indian women (N = 413) living in the greater Washington, DC metropolitan area in their propensity to enact three behaviors  breast cancer-related information seeking, breast self-exams, and clinical screening. Two variables found to predict outcomes in a consistent manner were knowledge about breast cancer guidelines and efficacy beliefs. Use of the RPA framework explained approximately 16 to 27 percent of the variance. Implications for breast cancer prevention campaigns are also discussed."

The emotional adaptation takes place by varying the way of presenting the background of the main message to be communicated, such as adding a graphical background to a text message or an audio effect to a video or picture message. Underlying the design is a Psychological Customization system that enables the creation of targeted ways of presenting information to users to facilitate various transient psychological effects such as emotion."

Instead of the industrial-era publisher/provider model of causation in creative media, it is now possible to propose a demand model of creativity in an evolutionary model of the economy. This sees creative culture in terms of the growth of knowledge among the entire population, not merely among industry or artistic experts. Instead of being the objects of causal sequence, audiences become its subject, navigating as agents, not being pushed around as passive effects. This model looks out towards the future, not the past; it is an emergent model of innovation. Here creativity may be located as part of human capital  the abundant resource numbering billions, formerly known as the audience."
2008-1624,User-Generated Online Video and the Atlantic Canadian Public Sphere: A YouTube Study,Using Online Media for Civic Engagement,,,,Paper,User-Generated Online Video and the Atlantic Canadian Public Sphere: A YouTube Study,Using Online Media for Civic Engagement,"User-generated online video is a dynamic information and communication technology (ICT) that holds the promise of democratic, interactive expression and discourse. Our study examines user-generated online video and the virtual public sphere by analyzing both the content and the responses of YouTube users to YouTube videos, focusing on issues of regional identity, levels of engagement, and creativity. There continues to be an important connection between geo-political identity and issues of public concern. The extent to which YouTube offers opportunities for Atlantic Canadians to engage with political issues depends on such factors as the continued popularity of the site in a competitive environment. While the potential for a creative public sphere of user-generated on-line video exists, the development of that potential depends on the recognition that viewer engagement with the content is affected by the style and quality of presentation, as well as the content."
2008-1625,Using A Psychographic Consumer Audience Segmentation Tool to Explain Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Behavior,Whos Your Audience: Approaches to Audience Segmentation,,,,Paper,Using A Psychographic Consumer Audience Segmentation Tool to Explain Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Behavior,Whos Your Audience: Approaches to Audience Segmentation,"This study assessed the utility of a consumer-based audience segmentation tool, VALS, combined with the theory of planned behavior (TPB), to explain F&V consumption in a cross-sectional sample of N = 1,587 U.S. adults.
In a multi-group structural equation model, the VALS audience group variable was found to moderate latent TPB relationships. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were found to significantly predict intention to eat F&Vs. Together; all three predicators explained 57% to 70% of the variation in intention across five different VALS groups. Perceived behavioral control and intention also predicted self-reported consumption behavior (R2 = 20% to 71% across VALS groups). Overall, these findings confirm the efficacy of using the theory of planned behavior to explain variation in F&V consumption, as well as the validity of using a consumer-based algorithm to segment audiences for F&V messaging."
2008-1626,Using Media Literacy to Improve Young Children's Understanding of Food Advertising,Media Literacy and the Health and Well-Being of Children,,,,Paper,Using Media Literacy to Improve Young Children's Understanding of Food Advertising,Media Literacy and the Health and Well-Being of Children,"Parents and educators have long lamented children's exposure to TV commercials for toys, sugared cereals, soda and snacks. Growing demands for governmental regulation of children's food advertisements are based on the belief that young children cannot understand selling intent and are unable to think critically about misleading media messages. Media literacy education addresses this problem by building critical analysis of media messages into children's education and co-viewing with parents.
This study evaluates the effectiveness of a K-1 media literacy curriculum that teaches students about healthy nutrition and advertising through critical decoding of toy, cereal and ""fruit"" commercials. Using a quasi-experimental design, researchers interviewed 214 children either before or after being taught the media literacy lessons. Results showed that even 5-year-olds can be taught some understanding of the purpose of TV commercials, identifying tricks used to sell products, judging claims about fruit, and understanding the parts of a complete, healthy breakfast."
2008-1627,Using Public Relations to Promote Health: A Framing Analysis of Public Relations Strategies Among Health Associations,High Density: Media Influences on Health,,,,Paper,Using Public Relations to Promote Health: A Framing Analysis of Public Relations Strategies Among Health Associations,High Density: Media Influences on Health,"This study explored health organizations public relations efforts to frame health issues through their press releases. Content analysis of 316 press releases from three health organizationsthe American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and the American Diabetes Associationrevealed that they used the medical research frame most frequently and emphasized societal responsibility for health issues. However, there were differences among the organizations regarding the main frames and health issues; the American Diabetes Association was more likely to focus on the issues related to social support and education, while the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society were more likely to address medical research and scientific news. To demonstrate their initiatives for public health, all the organizations employed the social support/educational frame most frequently. Researchers and medical doctors were frequently quoted as trusted sources in the releases."
2008-1628,Using Public Will to Secure Political Will,Agenda Setting,,,,Paper,Using Public Will to Secure Political Will,Agenda Setting,"How can political leaders mobilize public will to secure political will? Securing political will is a complicated and challenging endeavor that involves securing public will if enacted correctly via media gatekeepers, segments of the population, and politicians. Political leaders want to secure public will to solve problems and control situations. There must be a clear differentiation between political and public will to do so. Reform campaigns are sometimes initiatives from the top-down via political will and at other times from the bottom-up with public will brought to bear in cultivating political will. Regardless of a reforms origin, interested parties must define the issue, raise the policy profile, and drive policy implementation. . Social problems in governance are socially constructed and it is therefore essential to determine public perception of such problems. Knowledge of these perceptions will enable reform agents to define a policy problem and provide examples that resonate with public perceptions. Drawing on social science research will inform these efforts. Relevant areas of study include agenda building and setting, framing, and public opinion processes. This paper focuses on communication strategies in political will campaigns from the initial concept to securing the desired change."
2008-1629,Using Targeting and Tailoring to Enhance Prevention Messages for Hispanics,High Density: Message Design Research,,,,Paper,Using Targeting and Tailoring to Enhance Prevention Messages for Hispanics,High Density: Message Design Research,"Guided largely by the extended parallel process model (Witte, 1992), the goal of this experiment was to assess the effects of targeted and tailored web-based messages on Hispanics perceived susceptibility to kidney disease, and on their intention to talk to a doctor about kidney disease (the recommended behavior). Two-hundred and seventeen English-speaking Hispanics age 40 and older were recruited using an online survey service, and randomly assigned to read one of four messages (i.e., control, generic, targeted, and tailored). The hypothesis predicted a positive linear trend between type of message received and perceived susceptibility and intentions. Results were partially consistent with the hypotheses. Specifically, perceived susceptibility to kidney disease was highest in the tailored condition, followed by the generic and targeted conditions (which did not differ from each other), followed by the control condition where perceived susceptibility was the lowest. For behavioral intention, those in the tailored, targeted, and generic conditions did not differ from each other, however, all three did report greater intentions to ask a doctor about kidney disease than those in the control condition. The theoretical and practical insights and implications of these findings are discussed."
2008-1630,Using the Emotion-in-Relationships Model to Predict Features of Interpersonal Influence Attempts,terpersonal Influence and Motivation,,,,Paper,Using the Emotion-in-Relationships Model to Predict Features of Interpersonal Influence Attempts,Interpersonal Influence and Motivation,"We consider how the Emotion-in-Relationships Model (ERM), a theory designed to predict peoples experience of emotion, may explain persuasive messages. We conducted a study in which 248 individuals simulated leaving a date request voice mail message for their partner. Consistent with ERM, interference and facilitation from partners predicted peoples perceptions of risk to themselves and to their courtship. Facilitation from partners was positively associated with identity management strategies, positive politeness, and the affection of messages. Interference from partners was negatively associated with the fluency of messages. Taken together, our findings shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of ERM as a theory of interpersonal communication."

Specifically, ads were created to communicate diabetes prevention information among rural Hispanics in the Southwest. Because this population is historically underserved, because of both their rurality and minority status, effective healthcare messages are an overdue necessity. Results from a survey and focus group phases of the study resulted in population-specific and culturally relevant cues to be included in the created PSAs. Both television and radio PSAs containing diabetes prevention information were experimentally tested. Psychophysiological measures (heart rate, skin conductance response, and facial electromyography) were obtained to assess attention and emotional responses to the PSAs. Recognition memory was also tested to assess effectiveness. Potentially mediating variables to message effectiveness among Hispanics (sensation seeking and acculturation) were also obtained via self-report."

Using candidates in the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, the study explores how the Internet affects their messaging and campaign behaviors as they attempt to tailor their messages to very specific demographics and interest groups. It analyzes a traditionally central rhetorical strategy of these presidential candidates, the personal story, now found on the candidates official websites. Applying fantasy theme analysis, we consider how the photographic images found on the biographical sections of the sites are used in an effort to build intimate relationships with various voting publics. Fantasies of patriotism, family, heritage, multi-culturalism, and populism are identified in both parties candidates. Within the parties the visual strategies of the sites are stereotypical and clichéd, and seem to flatten the differences rather than highlight the candidates qualities. Between the parties, differences are observed in motives and perceptions of what should be valued. Results suggest that analysts have a powerful tool for understanding rhetorical communication in todays online and rich media environment using SCT."
2008-1633,Validating Measures of Scanned Information Exposure in the Context of Cancer Prevention and Screening Behaviors,canning and Seeking Cancer Information,,,,Paper,Validating Measures of Scanned Information Exposure in the Context of Cancer Prevention and Screening Behaviors,Scanning and Seeking Cancer Information,"Individuals may obtain a considerable amount of health information, particularly from the mass media, without engaging in purposeful information searches (called scanning). This study used the Seeking and Scanning Behavior Survey of the General Population (SSBG), a nationally representative survey of adults aged 40-70 years (n=2,489), to validate measures of scanned information exposure about cancer prevention and screening behaviors. Scanned exposure measures concerning specific behaviors (exercise, fruit and vegetable consumption, dieting, and mammogram, PSA and colonscopy screening) appear to have good face validity and to be convergent across behaviors (mean correlation across six preventive behaviors=0.50, sd=0.09). These measures can be discriminated from measures of general media exposure (mean r=0.23, sd=0.02) and seeking exposure for the same behaviors (mean r=0.25, sd=0.06). Scanned information exposure was associated with weekly volume of newspaper coverage for two of six behaviors, providing additional evidence of nomological validity. Scanned information exposure at the first round of measurement was substantially associated with identical exposure one year later (mean r=.41, sd=.04). Scanned exposure measures were also significantly associated with five of the six preventive behaviors. These results provide evidence that scanned information exposure measures are valid indicators of the construct. Researchers might consider their use to capture scanned media influence on cognitions and behaviors."
2008-1634,Value Orientations in Virtual Online Communities? An Empirical Study Among Adolescents,The Social Impact of Online Games,,,,Paper,Value Orientations in Virtual Online Communities? An Empirical Study Among Adolescents,The Social Impact of Online Games,"Research indicates that adolescents cherish heterogeneous values such as harmony, friendship and individualism but also law and order (Shell 2006). As system theory assumes that values (social reality) are reflected in media content (Luhmann 1995), we may assume that these value orientations are shaped by a leisure activity that is growing in importance for adolescents  computer gaming. Our research question is twofold: On the one hand we want to find out if the preferences for certain computer games are influenced by the personal norms of the gamers and on the other hand side we are especially interested in the question, if value orientations of adolescents are reflected in the life of online gaming communities. A correlation between online gaming and social values seem to be plausible as online gamers themselves create the virtual worlds they are living in, so that video games were already called a private laboratory for identity work (Jansz 2005). In our presentation, we will demonstrate the importance of different value orientations among adolescents and their relationship with computer gaming. For an intercultural comparison, data are collected by a quantitative survey among adolescents in two countries. Results are discussed with regard to possible effects of gaming on social values under the perspective of cultivation analysis Williams (2006) and one step further on real social life."

2008-1636,Video Game Culture as Popular Culture? The Productive Leisure of Video Game Workers of Montreal,Games and Culture,,,,Paper,Video Game Culture as Popular Culture? The Productive Leisure of Video Game Workers of Montreal,Games and Culture,"In this paper, we study the culture of video game workers themselves rather than assuming from the outset that there a distinct corporate culture specific to video game companies. In a context of liquid work (Deuze 2007) where the boundaries between private life and work place are blurring, it seems judicious to study the culture of video game workers from their individual point of view. More precisely, we choose to examine the cultural leisure of these workers. Cultural leisure refers to the practices that are linked to the worlds of art and cultural entertainment (both legitimized and popular cultural practices). Our aim is to describe the variety of cultural leisure practiced by these workers and to study the relationships between that cultural leisure and their professional activity. We will see that cultural leisure is often prone to be recycled in a personal professional project or in a working context."
2008-1637,Video Politics: Typologies of User-generated Content,"Engaging With YouTube: Methodologies, Practices, Publics",,,,Paper,Video Politics: Typologies of User-generated Content,"Engaging With YouTube: Methodologies, Practices, Publics","Innovations in Web 2.0 software have reformatted the locations, participants and methodologies of digital user-generated content (UGC). As a fairly recent phenomenon, online UGC does not have the refined framework or vocabulary needed for its accurate analysis. Prior scholarship regarding offline user-generated or user-modified content, such as that which covers zine culture, fan fiction, music sampling and remixing, and hot rod car modification provide a starting point for an analytical framework, but our work seeks to provide the tools necessary for developing an approach to new UGC trends in a networked, digital context. The paper develops several categories that make apparent the subtleties of online user-generated content, covering wholly original content, borrowed or poached content, and remixed or mashed up content. These categories provide a vocabulary for the economy of creativity regarding online UGC. By developing these terms we can begin to question how user-generated practices intersect with copyright law, fair use/fair dealing policy, cultural conceptions of ownership and authorship, and co-optation of user work. These categories allow us to unpack and elucidate the conditions behind user involvement in the mediaspace of YouTube and similar sites. In particular, we use examples from recent Canadian political campaigns where bloggers, political parties, content owners and poachers all played a role in introducing UGC into the Canadas political realm.

2008-1638,Video Production as a Bridge Between the University and the Community: Going Beyond a Client-Based Model,pecial Topics in Instructional Communication: From Apprehension to Service Learning,,,,Paper,Video Production as a Bridge Between the University and the Community: Going Beyond a Client-Based Model,Special Topics in Instructional Communication: From Apprehension to Service Learning,"Service learning takes students into the community to improve learning experiences as well as to provide a needed service to neighborhoods or organizations. Professors who teach video or film production courses in post-secondary educational settings often adopt a client based-model, which assigns students the task of producing media content with or about community institutions. By introducing the course, Leadership in Community Media, this paper suggests a new service-learning model, which develops a partnership with local youth media programs and makes college students directly work with teenage students. It explores how this model can enhance the learning experiences for both college students and teenagers in local media programs. This process allows college students more flexibility and closer relationships with the community than client-based model and provides youth with more resources."
2008-1639,Viewing and Avoidance of Al-Jazeera Satellite Channel in Kuwait: A Uses and Gratifications Perspective,Media Beyond the Middle East,,,,Paper,Viewing and Avoidance of Al-Jazeera Satellite Channel in Kuwait: A Uses and Gratifications Perspective,Media Beyond the Middle East,"Employing the uses and gratifications perspective, this study examined factors that motivated Kuwaitis to watch or avoid watching Al-Jazeera satellite channel and their relationships with political interest and trust in government. Viewers obtained several gratifications that included opinion leadership, free marketplace of information, and surveillance. Those who avoided watching Al-Jazeera did so for partisanship, biased coverage and political apathy.
The relationships between gratifications derived from watching Al-Jazeera with political interest and trust in government revealed that those who were very interested in politics were more likely to watch Al-Jazeera for its opinion leadership and surveillance functions. Importantly, the results of this study showed that trust in government was negatively associated with Al-Jazeeras role as a free marketplace of information, its credibility in news presentation, and Kuwaits image in the Arab world.
The results of this study support and reinforce our understanding of the various postulates of the uses and gratifications theory. Satellite television networks such as Al-Jazeera have created a free marketplace of ideas and information that would eventually engender citizens to speak for themselves rather than allow authorities to speak for them. Furthermore, these networks have become open forums for average Arabs to express their ideas and exchange views."
2008-1640,Violent Media Consumption Predicts Diminished Negative Arousal and Proactive Aggression in Young Adults,"Long-term Relations Between Different Types of Exposure to Media Violence, Emotional Reactions, and Aggressive Behavior",,,,Paper,Violent Media Consumption Predicts Diminished Negative Arousal and Proactive Aggression in Young Adults,"Long-term Relations Between Different Types of Exposure to Media Violence, Emotional Reactions, and Aggressive Behavior","It is hypothesized that violent media exposure in adults can relate to proactive or reactive aggression, but for different reasons. For those in whom violent media exposure is coupled with diminished anxious arousal and increased positive arousal, one should find increased violence approval and proactive aggression, but not reactive aggression. On the other hand for those in whom violent media exposure is coupled with angry arousal in response to media violence, one might find reactive aggression. Furthermore, it is argued that diminished anxious arousal would result from long-term violent media consumption because of desensitization. Two studies conducted among young adults in Poland confirmed that when violent media consumption was followed by diminished anxious arousal and positive emotional reactions to media violence, it predicted violence approval and proactive aggression but not reactive aggression. The findings are interpreted in terms of emotional and cognitive desensitization to media violence."

Though people are classified into social categories in their physical life, the digital world offers tools for a more a fluid means of recreating ones identity. This exploratory study examines the creation and interpretation process of physically real ethnic people and their virtual representations in the digital world. The study asks if people will still confine themselves to preexisting forms of human classification when given tools to eliminate this social construction. Grounded in a theoretical framework combining aesthetic theory, the encoding/decoding model and supportive literature on the construction of virtual representation, ethnicity as a worthy identity characteristic to examine is established. Through questionnaire, interview and discourse analysis, this study helps illuminate the creation and interpretation process of ethnicity in the digital world."

Immersive virtual environment technology (IVET) enables novel ways of manipulating identification with a model. In a laboratory experiment, participants photographs were used to create model avatars that resembled the self. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, where they were exposed to an avatar of the self running on a treadmill, an unknown others avatar running, or an avatar of the self loitering. A follow-up survey was administered 24 hours after the experiment. Participants in the self-running condition demonstrated significantly higher levels of exercise than those in the other-running and self-loitering conditions. Implications for social cognitive theory and health behavior change are discussed."
2008-1643,Virtually True: Childrens Acquisition of False Memories in Virtual Reality,Learning Effects of Interactive Media,,,,Paper,Virtually True: Childrens Acquisition of False Memories in Virtual Reality,Learning Effects of Interactive Media,"Previous work on human memory has shown that prompting subjects with false events and self-relevant information via narratives, mental imagery, and edited two dimensional images creates false memories. Using immersive virtual environment technology (IVET) this study examines how memory is affected by witnessing a dynamic simulation of an avatar bearing physical resemblance to oneself performing a novel action never performed by the physical self. Fifty-five pre-school and elementary children were randomly assigned to one of four memory prompt conditions (idle, mental imagery, IVET simulation of another child, or IVET simulation of self). Results showed that pre-school children were near ceiling and developed false memories regardless of condition. For elementary children the mental imagery and IVET self conditions caused significantly more false memories to emerge than the two control conditions. Implications are discussed regarding the use of digital media in the courtroom, clinical therapy settings, entertainment, and other applications."
2008-1644,Visibility of Journalistic Processes and the Undermining of Objectivity,Digital News,,,,Paper,Visibility of Journalistic Processes and the Undermining of Objectivity,Digital News,"Transparency has become a buzzword of late and has received a great deal of attention. The interactive potential of digital media has been one key element of transparency that has been noted by scholars. In this paper it is argued that the high speed of online news, by showing previously hidden journalistic processes, could also play a part in the orientation towards a transparency norm in journalism. It is further argued that both interactivity and the high speed of online news contribute to the move for journalism from knowledge-as-product towards knowledge-as-process. Finally it is argued that rituals of transparency fit the latter mode of communication better than traditional rituals of objectivity and therefore forms a superior tool to justify journalisms raison d´être when it moves from an analogue to a digital medium of communication."
2008-1645,Visible Objects vs. Videnda: Remarks on What is Seen and What is Shown,"Ethics of Perception, Ethics of Communication",,,,Paper,Visible Objects vs. Videnda: Remarks on What is Seen and What is Shown,"Ethics of Perception, Ethics of Communication","This paper deals with the ontology of certain phenomena in visual communication. A common but rather vulgar understanding of media imagery presupposes that one is able to ?see? facts by watching images (e.g. news footage on television). This idea is based on a presumed iconic relationship between image and depicted object. Furthermore, this mistaken approach to visual communication presupposes that the documentary value of news imagery relies on some mysterious form of causality between an actual state of affairs (e.g. a news event) and its pictorial representation.
My paper suggests a theoretically more refined approach to visual meaning. The conceptual distinction suggested is between visible objects, i.e. objects that can be seen, and videnda, i.e. objects that are displayed in order to be watched. Accordning to this distinction, there is both an epistemic and an ontological difference between these two categories of things. Ontologically, visible objects are natural objects while videnda are social objects ? or more precisely, material objects with a social function. Epistemically, visible objects are to be regarded as meaningful in there own right (if in any) while videnda are meaningful only in the context of a certain communicative situation.
Anything that can be seen is a visible object. Some visible objects will function as videnda as they are used as expressions or instruments in visual communication, i.e. in cultural meaning construal. The main thesis of this paper goes as follows: The meaning of a visible object is created by each viewer in a specific cultural context. The meaning of a videndum is created within a cultural context in a social act that involves a communicator who displays the videndum and a counterpart who watches it. Imagery, e.g. visual narratives, must be analysed on many levels simultaneously. An image has a communicative meaning, but all depicted objects have their meaning as well."
2008-1646,Visual Competence and Media Literacy: Can One Exist Without the Other?,Visual Competence: A New Paradigm?,,,,Paper,Visual Competence and Media Literacy: Can One Exist Without the Other?,Visual Competence: A New Paradigm?,"In the last twenty years the notion that images overpower words, and the belief that a decreasing lexical literacy among the young has been offset by an increasing visual literacy, has been repeated often enough to become accepted wisdom. Yet the precise nature of visual literacy among the young, and the relationship between visual competencies and the notion of media literacy has not been fully explored or adequately specified. Often visual literacy is defined merely as technical facility with video and digital interfaces. Sometimes, the concepts of visual literacy and media literacy are unproductively conflated, and visual competencies are assumed on the part of those that exhibit familiarity with media culture. In either case, what is largely missing is an articulation of the precise nature of the visual, and therefore the criteria for what we mean by visual competencies.
In this paper I compare and analyze the concepts of visual competence and media literacy and argue that awareness of visual forms and characteristics, and their implications, is necessary for what has routinely been described in the literature as media literacy. At the same time, visual competence outside of a broader operational context of media literacy fails to produce more critical and sophisticated media reception. Through an examination of the role of images in news coverage I attempt to more clearly articulate criteria of visual competence for news viewers, and more precisely relate visual communication competencies to media literacy skills."

Through historical and discourse analysis, the paper finds that Focus values visual practices that mark public space as religiously-charged. These practices are rooted in the groups perception of the U.S. as a pseudo-official Christian theocracy. Focus sees these practices as currently under attack in an iconoclastic campaign to rid public life of Christian imagery and influence. The paper suggests that the group thus places a high premium on dominating the commonly-shared visual environments of the United States. The paper warns that despite civil libertarian efforts to curb their influence, authoritarian groups like Focus on the Family have had success in claiming discursive power over religious imagery."

The intensity of CCTV expansion has caught the attention of social scientists who have begun to investigate the reasons for this proliferation and its social and political implications. One under-explored area in this research concerns the intensified problem of surveillance labor created by the vast amount of surveillance video footage generated by these systems. This paper examines the twin problems of visual information overload and the work of watching, exploring the ways that new digital techniques of image analysis are being envisioned and applied to address these problems  in the process transforming both police work and norms for establishing the authority and credibility of images."

An experimental study was designed to test the effects of culture-congruent visuals on verbalizers and visualizers affect, perception and behavioral intentions, in contrast to culture-incongruent visuals. These manipulated visuals included presence or absence of a visual story line, early or late brand acknowledgement as well as individual or group images within commercials. Two experiments were conducted with U.S. and Chinese college students utilizing the same stimuli and equivalent measurement. For U.S. viewers, results consistently pointed to the effectiveness of culture-congruent visuals, and a main visualizer effect. For Chinese viewers, results were inconsistent, indicating that the influence of culture congruent factors is probably more complicated than commonly assumed."

First some persistent impediments and misconceptions are being discussed regarding the current versions of the domains and concepts that are routinely associated with building up this kind of expertise: visual culture, visual studies, visual literacy. Next, some concrete ideas are being developed with respect to a more productive approach to developing visual expertise, that seeks to go far beyond what is currently being theorized and put in practice.
A more encompassing version of visual studies, both in terms of subjects, theories, methods and required types of expertise, may gradually develop into an overarching interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary concern for understanding and dealing with the visual in human endeavors in the broadest sense, and establish a more solid focus on integrating - wherever possible - insights of a very varied nature. This does not necessarily require the dismantling of existing (sub)disciplines into a new one, but the creation of a meeting place of disciplines (through journals, conferences, joint research projects) to seek a common ground where disciplinary battles can be put aside, and where crossing borders becomes more accepted and less prone to amateurism. I will argue for such a new version of visual studies that is more (self)critical, more visual, more empirical, more methodological, more technologically savvy, more integrated and more inclusive. This stance will also reflect upon the nature and span of the visual competencies that need to be developed to serve both scholarly and societal needs."

Riis had to draw upon a complex amalgamation of technological and narrative tools in order to convincingly and reassuringly locate his images (and the technological means enabling their production) within the version of progressive reform ideology shared with his audience. I argue that Riis was a highly effective propagandist whose narratives were, however, haunted by a set of limitations intrinsic to the slumming gaze."
2008-1652,"Volunteers, Volunteering and Volunteerism: A Review of Discourses of Representation, Understanding, Suspicion, and Vulnerability",Beyond the Profit Motive: Values-Based Organizing,,,,Paper,"Volunteers, Volunteering and Volunteerism: A Review of Discourses of Representation, Understanding, Suspicion, and Vulnerability",Beyond the Profit Motive: Values-Based Organizing,"Volunteerism is often suggested as a novel solution to social problems, and it is a significant international phenomenon. In this essay, we engage in a multi-disciplinary review of literature of the topic. We begin by clarifying three key terms around which our review is organized: volunteer, volunteering, and volunteerism. We take an explicitly discursive approach in our review, treating academic research as instantiations of discourses of representation, understanding, suspicion and vulnerability (Mumby, 1997), and use this framework to identify key areas of research and their possibilities and limitations. We conclude with some suggestions for future study."

Cable came into Israeli homes in 1990, spreading swiftly such that by 1999 70%+ of households were subscribers. Approximately 200 groups affiliated with different organizations, community centers, and senior citizen groups produce community broadcast programs."
2008-1654,Wanted: Methodologies that Accurately Measure the Role of Media in the Real Lives of Migrants in their Communities,Changing Networks: New Methodologies in Media and Cultural Diversity Research,,,,Paper,Wanted: Methodologies that Accurately Measure the Role of Media in the Real Lives of Migrants in their Communities,Changing Networks: New Methodologies in Media and Cultural Diversity Research,"In a post-911, post London bombings, post assasination of Theo van Gogh world, conducting research in migrant communities in Europe has become increasingly difficult. Concerns about new regulations limiting immigration, and increased levels of discrimination have contributed to an environment where formerly cooperative informants have refused to participate. Traditionally successful strategies for recruiting people to participate in surveys and agree to be interviewed about a range of topics, including those about uses of communication technologies, are not working so well of late. Scholars who wish to conduct research among the migrants in their communities need to develop flexible strategies for obtaining information. Adopting techniques of anthropologists and sociologists who conduct research under difficult circumstances may be useful. More time spent in the field collecting background information about the concerns and experiences of minority communities will have to take place if researchers are to be successful. The lessons learned from research conducted in the Netherlands among newer arrivals from Turkey in 2006 form the basis of the insights about needed methodological shifts. This research anticipated the exploration of the bridging and bonding activity of the newer migrants via the Internet. Low levels of literacy also required flexibility in redefining communication technologies."
2008-1655,War or Peace Journalism in Elite U.S. Newspapers: Exploring News Framing on Pakistan-India Conflict,Journalism and Transition,,,,Paper,War or Peace Journalism in Elite U.S. Newspapers: Exploring News Framing on Pakistan-India Conflict,Journalism and Transition,"This paper aims at empirically testing John Galtungs model of Peace/war Journalism by analyzing news coverage of Pakistan-India conflict in two elite US newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington Post, from 2001 to 2002one of the peak times of the conflict.

The literature on war and peace journalism suggests that modern media are a major concern to combatants, publics, and media professionals and have insightful effect on calling attention to the conflict arena. Media coverage is integral to shaping the course of events in war and peace. Conflict reporting leads to accusations of bias from both sides (Galtung and Vincent 1992; Wolfsfeld, 2003; Lynch 2005).

Of the 135 stories, most were framed as war journalism. The US byline contributes majority of the stories in peace journalism while the Indian byline contributes majority of the stories in war journalism. War journalism stories tended to favor India over Pakistan. Peace journalism stories tended to favor Pakistan. The most salient indicators supporting war journalism frame, are: here and now, differences-oriented, partisanoriented and use of demonizing language. While the most salient indicators supporting peace journalism frame are: solution-oriented, causes and consequences, multi-party orientation and non-partisan-oriented."
2008-1656,Watching Betty: Latina Reception of Shifting Constructions of the Latina Body in U.S. Popular Culture,Reading Popular Media from the Margins: Emerging Directions in Women of Color Audience Studies,,,,Paper,Watching Betty: Latina Reception of Shifting Constructions of the Latina Body in U.S. Popular Culture,Reading Popular Media from the Margins: Emerging Directions in Women of Color Audience Studies,"Representations of the Latina body are increasingly visible in contemporary mainstream popular culture in the U.S. Historically, these depictions have been uni-dimensional relegating Latina actresses to perform mostly spitfires, maids, and self-sacrificing mothers. These representations usually adhere to a very specific construction of an authentic Latina bodycurvy, but still thin and marked as sexually available. This paper charts a shift in the construction of the Latina body in U.S. mainstream popular culture and explores how Latinas interpret these changing discourses of their bodies. In particular, it considers how Latina audiences make sense of these ruptures, namely a departure from a thin and hypersexualized body, by examining their reception of actress America Ferrera, star of the network television series Ugly Betty. This paper suggests that Latina audiences read representations of Ferreras body simultaneously through identification, (dis)identification, frustration, and pleasure."
2008-1657,"Watching the Nation, Singing the Nation: How Filipino Migrants in the UK Construct their Identity in Media Rituals of News and Karaoke",Racializing Asia at Home and Abroad,,,,Paper,"Watching the Nation, Singing the Nation: How Filipino Migrants in the UK Construct their Identity in Media Rituals of News and Karaoke",Racializing Asia at Home and Abroad,"This study explores the processes of identity construction of London-based Filipinos within and across the media rituals of news reception and karaoke. While news reception studies among diasporic audiences have been popular (e.g., Madianou 2005; Matar 2005), few research have been made on the use of karaoke, and fewer still that examine both practices side-by-side. While news reception has been recognized as a site of boundary-making, of inclusion and exclusion, across national imaginaries, I argue in this research that the seemingly innocent social practice of singing involves a similar negotiation of (imagined) national boundaries. As national identities are constantly flagged in daily life (Billig 1995), I examine here how Filipino audiences negotiate their multiple attachments in both rituals. From participant observation and qualitative interviews, I discover that news reception generally enables both banal nationalism and banal trans-nationalism, while karaoke functions more as a homeland-directed high holiday. Analyzing how audiences relate to both media in terms of their technology, content, and context, I also argue that individuals are enabled and disabled to weave in and out of self-presentations of Filipino-ness, British-ness, and cosmopolitanism according to particular situations. Crucially, this project highlights how media rituals do not simply facilitate social cohesion but also serve as contexts where contradictory social scripts converge and collide in the third space of diaspora."

They mark the landscape and are an everyday occurrence in our line of sight, so that they disappear from recognition after a while. In Mumfords terms, water towers serve as both a container technology and a logistical technology. As a container technology, water towers help sustain life but endure in prominence. They ensure that those within the public served have one of their basic needs supplied. As a logistical technology, they can mark territory as landmarks and as expressions of local identity. Since they are high-profile elements of an otherwise hidden public infrastructure, water towers exist as visible markers and expressions of local publics."

There were three key objectives for this research: understand the range of physical and cognitive abilities of preschoolers in the context of motion-based game play; understand how preschoolers interact with the Wii, specifically how they handle the various forms of play and game mechanics offered by the games currently on the market for this platform; and understand the expectations of the parents of preschoolers with regard to these new gaming platforms and the purchase and play contexts within which game play occurs. In addition to reporting on the research project designed to better understand the challenges and advantages of the motion-based play for preschoolers, we also discuss how the findings of this research were then implemented by a team of game producers to develop the first preschool-targeted game on the market."
2008-1660,West Indians and a Culture of Dissent in Liberian Journalism,From Science to Society: Discourses of Difference,,,,Paper,West Indians and a Culture of Dissent in Liberian Journalism,From Science to Society: Discourses of Difference,"As one of the only independent Black nations throughout the nineteenth century, the West African Republic of Liberia attracted thousands of Black immigrants from regions controlled by Western colonial powers, including the West Indies. Going against a tendency in mass communication research to emphasize the transfer of skills from industrialized to less industrialized countries, this study traced the impact of one region of the Third World upon another. Furthermore, it explores a possible link between culture, meaning patterns of behavior that persist over time within a territorially defined group, and a disposition toward social criticism. Most importantly, this study examines the intersection of ethnicity and journalism in a context other than the United States, which has been the focus of most available research on that subject. The conceptualization of ideology adopted here is rooted in the theoretical framework developed by Antonio Gramsci and those who have been influenced by him. For Gramsci, ideology (which he called spontaneous philosophy) is embodied in language, which is a totality of determined notions and concepts and not just of words grammatically devoid of content. Based on an examination of 50 microfilmed newspapers from 1830 to 1970, it is argued that a tradition of dissent identified with West Indians in Liberia was linked to their role in promulgating pan-Africanism, an ideology of kinship, history and heritage among people of African descent."

Discourses in the new media about adopted Chinese in American families may reveal an underlying power struggle and what shapes the current culture of Chinese adoption in the United States. The purpose of research for this paper was to explore coverage of Chinese transnational adoptions in selected media  the Washington Post and the New York Times since 1992. It is believed that coverage in the last 15 years may reflect significant social change in attitudes about adoptions and perhaps about the attitude toward Chinese government in the United States. Three patens of discourses regarding adoptive parents- adoptees relationship, adotees identities and the role played by the Chinese government in the adoption process were found in this research."

Previous research has examined the degree of consensus regarding character interpretation (Livingstone, 1992; Liebes & Katz, 1986); the parasocial relationship between the audience and characters (Horton & Wohl, 1956) and the potential for characters to promote values through their individual growth and development within the narrative (The Sabido Method). The paper explores the extent to which a heterogeneous audience is exposed to, and engages with characters in a new Nigerian television drama, Wetin Dey. Exposure and engagement will be measured through (spontaneous and prompted) measures of programme and character recall, and recency and frequency of viewing. Qualitative research conducted prior to and after the quantitative research further informs the assessment of audience exposure and engagement. The paper seeks to assess the underlining assumptions that exposure to, engagement with, and assessment of individual characters influences retention of messages within the drama."

After describing an integrative model of behavioral prediction, it is argued that consideration of segmentation dimensions such as past use are crucial in properly using behavioral theory to identify segments of a target population. Furthermore, it is suggested that descriptive media use analysis is critical in reaching a target audience with a media communication message. Our results show that past use as a segmentation dimension allows for proper identification of a segment to target with a communication message; and that our sample used specific media classes and vehicles through which health educators could reach them with a communication message. In sum, it is argued that behavioral theory and descriptive media use analysis complement each other in a comprehensive segmentation strategy by which health educators can target and reach a segment of a population."

The amount and types of sports programming an individual watches in a usual week were assessed, along with attitudes about masculinity as measured by the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory. A group of 183 U.S. college students completed the survey. Findings indicated that there are significant correlations between televised sports viewing habits and conformity to masculine norms, and more violent sports (such as Ultimate Fighting Championships) tend to be associated with a greater number of norms connected to Hegemonic Masculinity."

Launched with great fanfare in July 2005, MTV-Desi offered a mix of content sourced from MTV-India (Bollywood and Indi-pop) and homemade videos that provided glimpses into contemporary desi youth culture. Eighteen months later, MTV Networks pulled the plug on MTV-Desi, stating that the premium distribution model failed to draw in South Asian-Americans. Locating MTV-Desi in relation to the logics of the television industry in the U.S. (niche marketing to racial/ethnic minorities), satellite TV and the South Asian mediascape, and the changing dynamics of migration and shifting definitions of desi identity, I will pose questions concerning challenges faced by TV producers and cultural critics in imagining and mobilizing a diasporic audience community/commodity.

It analyzed 281 front-page news articles drawn from four local newspapers primarily serving the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi and Louisiana (Hattiesburg American, The Clarion-Ledger, Sun Herald and The Times-Picayune) and two national newspapers with nation-wide coverage (The New York Times and The Washington Post). The findings indicate that most sources of disaster news stories were local and federal governments. A majority of local newspapers used local sources, especially local government officials. A preponderance of articles was written as local news items. Damage was discussed frequently, framed to meet standard journalistic criteria for newsworthiness. The most dominant frame across local and national newspapers was human-interest news stories. Emotional responses played a prominent role in the news stories. Expressions of frustration and tiredness made up the top percentages of the news coverage of Hurricane Katrina. As the magnitude and effect of Hurricane Katrina became evident, news stories tended to move away from emphases on formal and informative coverage toward informal and supportive themes. This study provides practical implications for journalists covering a disaster event and suggests possible avenues for the theoretical exploration of the disaster news frame and its potential contribution to the framing studies."
2008-1667,What Do We Think of Gossipers? The Impact of Gossip Valence and Relationship Type on Liking and Trustworthiness,Deception and Trustworthiness,,,,Paper,What Do We Think of Gossipers? The Impact of Gossip Valence and Relationship Type on Liking and Trustworthiness,Deception and Trustworthiness,"Turner et al. (2003) conducted an experiment to empirically test whether gossip functions as a positive social communicative act, or whether gossip is perceived negatively, arguing that whether gossip serves as social glue or relational ruin is a function of the interaction between gossip valence and the relationship between the source and the target. Two experiments are presented here to re-test and extend Turner et al.s findings.
In Experiment 1, as hypothesized, individuals trusted their friends more than they trusted strangers regardless of the valence of gossip. Positive gossip led to spikes in trust and negative gossip produced sharp drops in ability to trust strangers. Data also indicate that when strangers gossip negatively they will be disliked and distrusted. Persuasiveness of the message did not change as a function of the independent variables. These results are consistent with Turner et al.s hypotheses. In experiment 2, expectancy violations were measured to empirically test whether a positive or negative impression of the gossiper depended upon the valence of the gossip and the relationship between the source and the target. Also, salience (relevance or irrelevance) of gossip was considered to test whether the salience of the gossip affects trust and liking. Data supported the finding of Study 1. Results indicated that there were no main effect of salience on impressions of trust and liking, but salience did interact with gossip valence to affect trust, suspicion, and negative expectancy violations."

In contrast, accounting rituals between accountability partners are marked by a call to address ones own violations of behavior expected of a Christian in a bid to accept personal responsibility for such behavior. As such, our goal is not simply to describe the formal structures of such communication activity, but to comprehend it as particular forms of discourse important for identifying ones self as Christian and constructing ones identity as accountable for inappropriate thought and behavior within evangelical Christian communities on campus."

An Application of the Situational Theory of Publics,Government Public Relations and Public Diplomacy: Old and New Directions,,,,Paper,What Drives Political Activity in College Students? An Application of the Situational Theory of Publics,Government Public Relations and Public Diplomacy: Old and New Directions,"With publics continuously shifting and reforming, what prompts publics to participate in political action as well as characteristics about active publics remains unknown. Even less is known about young adults and the college-aged population and what common characteristics politically active and inactive publics within this group have. The purpose of this study is to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and motivations of politically active college students through use of the situational theory of publics. This study examines the factors associated with this diversity of political activity. The existence of several well-funded, national-level student political organizations suggests the importance that the major political parties place on student involvement in political activity, particularly at the grass roots level. This study also examines the views of the students that become involved in politically and socially active student organizations, in contrast to those who do not.

While some studies have tested the situational theory of publics within political situations, this remains an area needing further exploration. The study investigates the degree to which students involved in politically active student groups perceive constraints on their political involvement, the importance of political issues, and their involvement in political issues on a general level. This study further investigates two variables, problem recognition and constraint recognition, in more depth and detail centering on specific issues as well as other factors contributing to political activity including media usage, proximity level of issues, and inclusion in groups."

Sound installation artist Christina Kubisch deliberately blurs boundaries between natural and artificial sound, in order to question what we know by real experience rather than digital information. Annea Lockwood studied electronic music in Cologne in the early 1960s, but felt that synthesized sounds somehow lacked life. Her subsequent work, including recordings of rivers, attempts to answer her question: What for me constitutes life in a sound? Chantal Passamonte, who records experimental electronic music under the name Mira Calix, is drawn to analog synthesizers as well as wooden instruments, because both seem to breathe like little creatures. And noise musician Jessica Rylan, who designs and builds modular synthesizers, prefers to work with analog circuits because they follow natural laws, just like breaking a tree branch, or like water, or even like birds flying in a V. I will situate these artists work, as well as the medium of synthesized sound, within contexts of feminist and queer theories, and gendered aspects of electronic music historiography."

A Complexity Analysis of What Can Go Wrong,The Use of Complexity Science in Applied Organizational Settings,"This paper makes use of complexity science to frame a research agenda for the circumpolar High North, specifically the Barents Sea (and surround areas) area between Norway and Russia where as much as one third of the Worlds untapped natural oil and gas reserves exists. The authors combine two perspectives on complexity as part of their research proposal for examining the various economic, technological, ethical, political, social, ecological, and environmental interests in extracting this resource from the sea floor. This paper addresses the possibilities for failure in developing High North energy resources because the indicators show the pitfalls must be considered in relation to the promise. The development of these energy resources represents a crucial factor for sustained economic growth within the region and for providing energy security by adding another supplier to a global market. The question is how to use both increasing international attention and regional economic significance of energy resources to promote sustained economic growth."

To analyze these issues, this study conducted a survey of journalists who covered North Korea and a content analysis of media reports on North Korea. The study found that journalists? perceived source credibility has the most significant impact on their perceptions of the rogue state dimension of North Korea, whereas journalists? nationality best predicts their perceptions of the dialogue partner dimension of North Korea. In addition, their perceptions of attributes of North Korea positively correlated with media coverage of those attributes. The study advances research on media sociology and media coverage of international and diplomatic issues."
2008-1674,What Is a Zine and What Do You Do With It?,"Culture, Media, and New Ethnography",,,,Paper,What Is a Zine and What Do You Do With It?,"Culture, Media, and New Ethnography","Most published descriptions of zines  whether in the popular press or in the increasing numbers of scholarly articles and books about the form  emphasize their connection to the alternative press; their relationship to, yet difference from, magazines; their do-it-yourself ethics and aesthetics; the small numbers in which they were produced; and their dominant modes of circulation. Although such descriptions tend to foreground the production process, they also move almost immediately to the kinds of topics addressed in zines en route to an analysis of what they mean as forms and modes of alternative cultural communication. These descriptions suggest thereby that what one does with a zine is to read it.

While this paper will acknowledge the status of zines as texts that do indeed require reading, it will argue on the basis of initial research into the practice and universe of zine-ing among girls during the 1990s that zines are, in fact, much more than texts to be read. In the nineties, zines functioned as incitements to production and networking as many girls who encountered zines for the first time moved to create their own and to share them with others. As a consequence, zines were mobilized as shuttles, passed back and forth among girls, sometimes across great spaces, weaving them together not so much as people with shared interests but as subjects longing to articulate together incipient though suppressed affective lives. Zines operated as devices for enacting new forms of subjectivity and as technologies for producing altered networks of sociability. Zines functioned, then, as complex social technologies that are not easily accessed through the process of reading the texts alone. Oral history and a kind of longitudinal ethnography will be necessary to take the full measure of their significance as social forms. This paper will articulate the rationale for an oral history of girls zine-making in the nineties combined with an ethnographic study of the afterlives of this social practice as it played itself out when young zinesters moved into their twenties and early thirties. The paper will also explore some of the methodological, ethical, and political challenges posed by such a study."

A Qualitative Research Into the Perceptions of Youngsters,Communication and Technology Scholar to Scholar Interactive Paper/Poster Session,"This article departs from the observation that the existing research about cyber bullying is characterized by a lack of conceptual clarity, which, in its turn, has led to different operationalizations of the phenomenon and widely varying prevalence estimates. It then reports the results of a qualitative study into the perceptions of cyber bullying among youngsters (11-18 years old).The focus group data show that students often interpret cyber bullying as internet bullying, and associate the phenomenon with a wide range of (often IM related) practices. However, in order to be considered as true cyber bullying, these practices have to meet several criteria.The implications for future research are discussed."

Career stories provide powerful anticipatory occupational socialization influences. Their retelling illustrates conceptualizations of work and careers. We investigate messages and stories young children (PreK-4) recall receiving about occupations and careers in three different countries the United States, China, and Belgiumto examine cross-cultural and gender differences in message content, form, interpretation, and source. The data will be coupled with ongoing research to build a life-span documentation of career discourse. This project will be the first study examining underrepresentation of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) from both message-centered and anticipatory career socialization perspectives. Examining the specific messages embedded in early career socialization processes of young children opens new areas of research and interventions that can make an important difference in girls interests and later choices about education and careers."

Through a bit of psychoanalysis, a sprinkling of hybridity and racial triangulation, this essay contends the mediated representations of Black men and Asian women are mostly negative and that stereotypical depictions of these groups continue to be perpetuated in the media. By interrogating and problematizing the portrayal of these interracial relationships, specifically why both sex and marriage cannot be found together in any of the pairings, a call for the dismantling of binaries is issued and a move towards a hybridized space is presented."

In order to counter this shift to the left, corporate America organized a coordinated propaganda campaign. In the context of the cold war, corporations, advocacy groups, and trade associations actively promoted the idea that the interests of the nation were coterminous with the success of business, and portrayed the communist threat to the American way of life through the lens of consumer capitalism. The emerging medium of television uncritically adopted this perspective due to the mutually dependent relationship between the government and television news producers in this period. Cold War ideology was fundamentally about constructing the American nation and the American way of life as one of democracy and freedom guaranteed by a free market. By the 1960s, television had become a national and nationalizing medium due to its institutional structure and organization. This legacy persists to this day.

In this paper, I perform a close reading of 269 news reports on the 1997 UPS strike from the three major network channels (ABC, CBS and NBC), and argue that the strike was framed, both explicitly and implicitly, in nationalist terms. I show how the nationalist strike narrative promotes cross-class solidarity or a common national interest at the expense of other forms of community such as those forged along the class lines. In the process, the narrative serves to universalize the interests of the capitalist class. In short, the narrative repeats a theme raised over half a century ago by Charles Wilson, then president of GM, that what was good for GM was good for America."

Personal experience is measured by 1) the positive traveling or studying experience in the US, and 2) the positive personal contact with Americans; mediated experience is assessed by foreign peoples exposure to both news and entertainment content about the United States according to the amount of attention paid to news or entertainment content as well as the perceived valence of the media content; the deviance perception is measured in three dimensions: statistical, normative and social change deviance; national image of the United States is evaluated by asking how favorable or strong foreign people think the US is. Hierarchical regression analysis is used to assess the effect of personal and mediated experience and deviance perception on the image of the United States. This study may contribute to the literature of deviance and public opinion by including deviance into the study of national image. More important, it can provide practical implications for the US government as a useful guidance to conduct public diplomacy."

An Interrogation of Municipal Broadband Policy in the City of San Francisco,Digital Inclusion and Exclusion,"Grounded in the idea that meaningful engagement with technology and technological infrastructures requires attention to access, ownership, education, and content regulation, this study interrogates the meaning of the term ""digital inclusion"" during debates over municipal wireless plans in San Francisco. Between late 2003 and early 2006, the city embarked on an effort to provide free wireless access to residents. By the end of its process to select a private vendor to build the system, and in response to input from the public, the city recognized it needed to serve individuals and communities with little or no chance of benefiting from mere access to the internet. As a result, city officials developed a broader vision for digital inclusion based around the availability of hardware and training as well as locally-relevant content. However, local government was shy to pursue the details of its approach and furthermore failed to think beyond community-based education for digital inclusion or contemplate the impact of a public-private ownership model on residents' abilities to meaningfully interact with the network. By analyzing official city discourse alongside public discussion, this research offers suggestions on how to redefine digital inclusion for municipal wireless broadband initiatives elsewhere in the United States."
2008-1681,Whats Relevance Got To Do With It? A Moderated Mediation Exploration of the Appeal of Personalization in Websites,"Persuasion, Attitude Change, and Mediated Messages",,,,Paper,Whats Relevance Got To Do With It? A Moderated Mediation Exploration of the Appeal of Personalization in Websites,"Persuasion, Attitude Change, and Mediated Messages","Personalization, or tailoring of content to meet users unique needs, is considered an attractive and useful marketing strategy in diverse media. But, why is personalization so attractive? Is it because personalization results in relevant content? In order to causally determine the role of relevance, we would have to demonstrate its moderating effect, requiring us to factorially vary personalization with relevance. But this would be impossible because any operationalization of personalization will inevitably feature relevant content, thereby precluding the possibility of a personalization condition with non-relevant content. Therefore, we adopted a different strategy by experimentally varying the relevance of the advertisements to Website content, in keeping with recent trends in search-engine marketing. Using a 2x2 factorial design (N = 60), we investigated whether perceptions of websites and ads varied as a function of the presence of personalized content (personalization vs. non-personalization) and advertisements relevance to website context (relevant ads vs. irrelevant ads), guided by hypotheses derived from contextual priming and schema theories. Results indicate that relevance of ads to website context increases perceptions of personalization, leading to more positive attitudes. In addition, relevance moderates the relationship between personalization and participants perception of ads, such that participants who were exposed to relevant ads evaluated the ads more positively than participants who were exposed to irrelevant ads. However, this did not extend to participants perception of websites. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Analyzing Moral Messages of Genre Films,Media and Morality: The Ethics of Contemporary Media Production and Consumption,,,,Paper,Whats the Point of this Film? Whats the Point of this Genre? Analyzing Moral Messages of Genre Films,Media and Morality: The Ethics of Contemporary Media Production and Consumption,"Embedded in the surface story, moral messages in films convey important values and norms, and show which actions lead to success in life, and which do not. Very different stories may contain the same moral lesson. Regular viewers of narrative fiction are repeatedly exposed to both genre-specific and universal patterns of moral lessons. In the same way as violence or gender stereotypes cultivate an audience into adapting their world views to the television world, moral patterns may cultivate viewers in their moral thinking and acting. But how can moral messages in films be detected when they are most often implicit and hidden in the surface story? This paper presents an instrument for analyzing moral messages in films, which combines structuralist plot analysis from Narratology and heuristic categories from Grounded Theory. The instrument and its methodological foundations are described, and a detailed example is given to exemplify the application."

Anecdotal Evidence Increases Risk Perception of Hepatitis B Infection Among MSM,Overcoming Barriers to Effective Health Communication,"Hepatitis B (HBV) is a serious condition, and obtaining vaccination is a safe and simple method to prevent infection. However, the uptake of vaccination among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Netherlands has remained limited. A pilot study assessed cognitive and affective predictors of intention to obtain vaccination against HBV among MSM. The key predictors of vaccination intention were perceived risk of contracting HBV, and expectancies regarding the outcome of vaccination. In the main study, message evidence was then experimentally varied to increase perceptions of risk of contracting HBV: narrative evidence (i.e., a personal account), statistical evidence (i.e., abstract prevalence data), mere assertion of increased risk, and no risk information. As predicted, narrative evidence was most effective in increasing perceptions of personal risk and intention to obtain vaccination against HBV among MSM, and risk perception mediated the effect of type of message evidence on intention."
2008-1686,When Are Persons White? The Organization of Racial Categories in Talk-in-Interaction,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,,,,Paper,When Are Persons White? The Organization of Racial Categories in Talk-in-Interaction,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,"In this report, we contribute to the investigation of racial discourse by demonstrating some of the ways in which race is employed and made relevant by speakers in talk-in-interaction, and by showing how this in situ organization of membership categorization supports and reproduces race as a form of social organization. While Sacks pioneering work on membership categorization devices demonstrated the way in which racial categories can be produced to account for, or explain, action (Sacks 1984; Sacks 1986) we introduce another basis for the deployment of racial categories in talk-in-interaction  descriptive adequacy. When describing a person in physical terms, speakers employ a racial category in cases where a recipient could otherwise visualize a person of another membership category. Importantly, the use of a racial category for descriptive adequacy constitutes an interactional mechanism through which a different racial category is revealed as the tacit, but oriented-to locally taken-for-granted racial category. We then examine circumstances under which such taken-for-granted racial categories (particularly white) become relevant and are themselves made explicit. Taken together, these practices furnish empirical grounding in interactional materials for the relevance to participants of the taken-for-granted invisibility of whiteness, a phenomenon that has been noted by numerous race scholars (e.g., Frankenburg 1993; Lipsitz 1998; McIntosh 2004; Tatum 1997; Wetherell and Potter 1992)."
2008-1687,When Are Strong Arguments Stronger Than Weak Arguments? Deindividuation Effects on Message Elaboration in CMC,The Best of Information Systems,,,,Paper,When Are Strong Arguments Stronger Than Weak Arguments? Deindividuation Effects on Message Elaboration in CMC,The Best of Information Systems,"The present experiment examined how the lack of individuating information affects message elaboration and conformity to group norms in text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC). Participants made decisions about choice dilemma scenarios and exchanged their arguments with three ostensible partners via computer. Consistent with the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE), those who had exchanged personal profiles with their partners were better able to differentiate between strong and weak arguments and were more likely to make conformity decisions based on the message content than those who had not. On the other hand, those with no identity cues were more likely to factor in group identification for their conformity decisions. Results suggest that less systematic message processing and greater reliance on normative considerations account for how deindividuation moderates the effects of argument strength on group conformity."

Working with the belief that the 9/11/01 attacks were attributable to an intelligence failure, public figures (with intelligence backgrounds) have called for a distributed model of intelligence gathering. Called open source intelligence or public intelligence, this project seeks to enroll citizens as governmental agents via an open source agency employing covert networks. The public here is composed not via a public sphere, but a secret sphere (where espionage has become democratized). At the same time, the 9/11 Truth Movement employs collective intelligence and network tactics as an organizing tool and for knowledge distribution. How does this popular intelligence get positioned by, and respond to, agents of public intelligence? What is the role of professional journalism amidst these intelligence networks? These collective intelligence agencies are contestational, especially over what constitutes the public, investigation, and skepticism. What happens when networks overlap, get entangled, and conflict? This paper argues that as networks converge they do not simply produce new forms of participation (as in the convergence culture thesis)they also repropose the terrains of antagonism."
2008-1689,When Do Women Get a Voice? Explaining the Presence of Female News Sources in Belgian TV News,High Density Session: News Framing Around the Globe,,,,Paper,When Do Women Get a Voice? Explaining the Presence of Female News Sources in Belgian TV News,High Density Session: News Framing Around the Globe,"For more than a decade now, it has been demonstrated that female news sources receive little attention in television news. Usually women account for no more than 20 to 25 per cent of all the time devoted to people speaking in the news. In this article we assess when exactly female news sources are depicted in the news. We use a 25,896 item and 1,600 hours of television news dataset, covering public broadcasting and commercial television in Belgium (Flanders) for the years 2003 to 2005. The analysis shows that female news sources are strongly stereotyped and limited to traditional female topics. The impact of the gender of the reporter was quite limited. Contrary to expectations the broadcasting corporation with a longstanding gender diversity policy actually scored worse than its counterpart without such a policy. In the conclusion, we discuss the apparently difficult relation between traditional news standards and depicting gender diversity."

By using a retrospective account interview method, the author interviewed 10 pairs of Chinese romantic partners from a Chinese college and 10 pairs of American romantic partners from an American university in the first stage of the data collection. In the second stage, the author focused on young cross-cultural couples and interviewed 10 pairs of Chinese-American cross-cultural romantic partners through snowball convenience sampling. Through theme analysis of the data, this study has revealed that most young Chinese and Americans put higher values on chastity. In addition, they supported practical romantic relationships and viewed marriage as a final goal of dating and a chance for people to know the other person better. Also, for an appropriate date initiation, since people in Taiwan live within a collectivistic culture, they tended to initiate a date with more caution than their American counterparts. Moreover, first dates continue to reflect traditional practices in both American and Chinese cultures. As a preliminary research, this study is a genuine invitation to more culturally conscious discussions of the interpersonal relationships in general, and cross-cultural dating relationships in particular."

Based on the cognitive dissonance theory and motivated information processing, it is expected that when responding to incongruent messages, voters with strong party identification show less attitude change toward the candidates but greater attitude change toward the issue than voters with weak party identification (H1); the stronger initial issue position, the less attitude change toward the issue, but the greater attitude change toward the candidates (H2); voters with strong party identification and strong initial issue position will show a greater variation for both attitudes toward the candidates and toward the issue (H4). To test hypotheses, incongruent information about gun control (Study 1) and abortion (Study 2) is presented based on party identification and initial issue position. Attitudes toward the candidates and attitude toward the issue are measured after message exposure. Data collection will be completed by November 6, 2007."

Comparisons are made between research conducted in child development and psychology methodological traditions, and research conducted in the fields of communication, sociology, and anthropology which rely on ethnographic methods. An attempt is made to explain disparities in research findings. The issue of the practical consequences of research is raised as how social problems are defined result in public policies enacted to solve those social problems."
2008-1693,When the Market Does Not Reign Supreme: Localism and Diversity in U.S. Media Policy,Media Policy: Diversity and Integration,,,,Paper,When the Market Does Not Reign Supreme: Localism and Diversity in U.S. Media Policy,Media Policy: Diversity and Integration,"Deregulation of broadcast media in the U.S. has created an intense debate over national policies to promote localism and diversity in media markets. This paper explores the analytic framework and wide range of issues that the FCCs Broadcast Localism Initiative identified as central to localism and diversity. It identifies three categories of factors that explain why media markets may under-produce localism and diversity in the media including social factors (merit goods such as community value), a lack of fit between the political system and the economy (a federal systems and asymmetric representation) and traditional market failures (advertiser support resulting in a lack of price discrimination, economies of scale and externalities).

The record shows over two dozen concerns/objectives that constitute localism in five broad categories  coverage of local affairs, sensitivity to local taste, opportunity for local involvement, facilitation of local political discourse, and the impact of competition on localisms and diversity. Tot eh extent competition/consolidation enters the analysis, the question is how will it affect the achievement of the goal of promoting localism and diversity. The resulting framework contain well over 100 specific issues for analysis.

The multi-faceted and rich framework the FCC developed to define the policy goals of localism and diversity is a reminder that the hegemony of the market is challenged even in the U.S. and suggested as a platform for efforts by other nations to define and defend national media markets."

Forty-eight participants read 4 online news stories and viewed an attached video clip corresponding to each story. Heart rate and recognition memory data was collected. Results showed that video clips attached to a story written in traditional inverted pyramid style high elicited greater heart rate deceleration during the first half of the video clip than video clips attached to a story written in narrative style. This indicates that the video clips attached to the inverted pyramid stories required greater allocation of resources to encoding information. Recognition data demonstrated that details of the narrative stories were recognized more accurately than details from the inverted pyramid stories. These results are discussed in terms of a distinction between getting there and being there during different periods of exposure to online news.

Despite their communication relevance, they represent an under-researched area. Therefore, the present study aimed to discover how an organizational peer (male or female) dating another organizational member (another peer or superior) impacted employee perceptions of and responses to the peer. Full time employees completed measures assessing communication and relational perceptions based on a 2 (peer sex) x 2 (status dynamic) design. Results indicate that employees feel less solidarity and trust and engage in more information manipulation with a peer dating a superior compared to a peer dating another peer. Peer sex and partner status also interacted to affect trust and solidarity. Limitations, implications, and future research are discussed."
2008-1696,Where does it take place? Communication Studies and Space,Communication and Space: New Perspectives in Media Studies,,,,Paper,Where does it take place? Communication Studies and Space,Communication and Space: New Perspectives in Media Studies,"Slogans like geography matters or space makes a difference are often repeated but in media studies there have been few efforts to go deeper into these concepts and to systematically explore what kind of geography could
matter. This negligence of spatiality may be due to the inherent logic of the historical, functional or structural approaches, which tend to privilege time or social structure over space. There is also a tendency among social theorists to handle time and space as empty containers. Communication geography is a genealogical turn within the field of media
studies. Universal and ethnographic explanation models that have earlier been treated as dichotomies are brought together by exploring the spatial nature of time and temporal change of geography, as mobilized by communication. Examples are drawn from Eastern European ideological and economic change that has been actualized by media."

Cross-Cultural Variance in the Framing of the Enron Debacle,Framing,"The sources of frames have been a relatively neglected area in the study of journalistic frames. Here I examine whether cultural variation, as reflected in journalistic norms and traditions, influences the framing of a corporate scandal and find that this is indeed true on the basis of a comparative textual analysis of Le Monde and The New York Times. While Le Monde coverage is thematic, New York Times coverage is episodic. In addition, I elaborate a richer conceptualization of the distinction between thematic and episodic frames."

A Thematic Macroanalysis of Entertainment-Education Campaign Research,Global Communication and Social Change Top Papers: Education and Entertainment Media in Development,"The present study is a thematic macro-analysis of education entertainment campaign (EEC) research published in academic journals over time. Based on the entertainment perspectives, the study examined (a) a general overview of EEC research, (b) the characteristics of campaign vehicles, (c) applied theories, and (d) measured variables. Key findings included the quantitative growth of EEC research, in particular family planning campaigns through radio and TV drama in developing countries, with increasingly diversified campaign topics, channels, formats, and target audiences, in recent years. While the theoretical and methodological developments seemed to orient educational perspectives, very little EEC research has used entertainment-based theories and concepts. Based on the results, this study suggested that entertainment-driven studies incorporate a broader range of theories as well as methodological approaches that allow scholars to further advance this field."

With an eye towards contemporary media problems, this project aims to recuperate lost alternatives and yield fresh insights regarding the institutional role of the press in a modern democratic society. By situating the Hutchins Commission in a historical trajectory of media criticism and media reform movements, this paper illuminates perennial tensions and confrontations between the liberal ideals and commercial imperatives driving the U.S. press system. Drawing from historical institutionalism to contextualize the U.S. media systems current crisis, the paper concludes by outlining an emergent consensus that calls for structural reform and for reevaluating core normative democratic principles underpinning the social contract between U.S. media institutions and the public."
2008-1700,"While the Species Evolve, the Predators Eat",Why Institutions Matter: Considering Macro Phenomena in Organizational Communication Research,,,,Paper,"While the Species Evolve, the Predators Eat",Why Institutions Matter: Considering Macro Phenomena in Organizational Communication Research,"Organizational communication scholars have contributed to institutional theory by focusing on processes that bridge micro, macro, and meso levels. The best developed models of the process through which value-laden discourse extends through space and time tend to cast it as passive and evolutionary, as reflected in the dominant metaphorssedimentation, routinization, habitualization, and objectification. I argue that these processes increasingly have been supplemented by the creation and operation of think tanks, whose goal is to normalize and naturalize particular practices and beliefs that privilege one ideology over alternatives. These macroactors (Taylor & van Every, 2000) influence public policy directly, constructing situational guidelines and constraints within which organizational actors devise and implement strategy, and indirectly by accelerating, forming, and redirecting institutional emergence and evolution. I illustrate these processes with a comparative analysis (Lammers & Barbour, 2006) of free market advocacy organizations on national health policy in the U.S. and Canada."
2008-1701,White Cyberlies: The Use of Deceptive Instant Messaging Statuses as a Social Norm,Technology and Privacy,,,,Paper,White Cyberlies: The Use of Deceptive Instant Messaging Statuses as a Social Norm,Technology and Privacy,"Instant messengers offer the user the choice between several instant messaging statuses (e.g. online, away, busy) to indicate his/her availability. Results from focus group interviews show that young adolescents use these instant messaging statuses truthfully. Among older adolescents however, the instant messaging statuses are often used deceptively: even though the user is actually online, he/she chooses a status that reflects absence. This paper analyses the cyber social phenomenon of using deceptive instant messaging statuses from a symbolic interactionist perspective. This analysis reveals that the (shared) meaning of the instant messaging statuses changes for older adolescents: absent statuses work as a barrier against unwanted conversations. Based on this shared understanding, the deceptive use of instant messaging statuses has become accepted and expected (normative) social behaviour."

Imagining the Unbound Television Audience,Unboxing Television: TV and TV Studies in 2008,"The mechanisms by which audiences are imagined have enormous consequences for the production and distribution of media content, and the way media business is organized. The progression of television beyond the set by both official and unofficial means substantially alters conceptions of the audience. Encouraged to engage with content across different platforms, the audience is no longer bound to the living room or the act of watching. Accounting for unbound audiences requires a re-conception of audience practice and a reconfiguring of the strategies networks and channels employ to draw audiences together. This paper looks at the adjustment of major networks in the US, Australia, and UK to the changing landscape, examining the position they prescribe for their audiences through branding on and off the network. Moving beyond television-based branding materials such as idents and promos, networks are reaching out to audiences who look less and less like television viewers through online and extra-textual extensions. What are the implications for television when audiences are recast beyond viewing?

Joshua Green is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Comparative Media Studies program at MIT. His work examines participatory culture, the nature of participatory audiences, and changing television branding strategies. His forthcoming book (with Jean Burgess) about the uses of YouTube will be published by Polity in 2008."

Our goal is to introduce students to the dynamics of intercultural communication and help them become competent communicators in multicultural settings. Nevertheless, as part of the younger generation in the U.S. gradually loses their sense of cultural identity, an additional goal of an intercultural communication course is to enable students to deeply understand and share with others their own culture.

Teaching in a diverse urban setting like New York City, I have found that some students in my intercultural communication class appear to be perplexed when it comes to the discussion of cultural identity. The following critical questions are often raised by students with a mixed cultural background or who are new immigrants: Who am I now that I migrated to the U.S.? What is American culture/cultural identity? Who am I if my family is from several different cultures? Who am I if I identify with a number of cultures around the world due to the influence of globalization and new technology? Who am I if I dont identify with any cultural group? This paper will detail my reflection on teaching cultural identity in intercultural communication classes and the process of researching and improving my pedagogies in helping students to understand and maintain their cultural identity."

Journalists, News Censors, Readers, and News Content",Who Uses Local News and Why,"This study investigates how news content is shaped by individual, organizational, political, and economic forces. Four groups of people are identified  news staffers, news executives, news censors, and audiences, with each representing the four forces accordingly. A comparison of peoples newsworthiness assessments and news coverage provides an idea of how news content is shaped by the various forces. It also tells whether and how the four groups correspond with each other in their perception of newsworthiness. Data was collected from content analysis in a Chinese newspaper and surveys towards four groups of people in the city where the newspaper locates.
The results indicate that news content is shaped only by individual and organizational forces within newspaper organizations but is not affected by political and economic forces outside. The influences from individual forces are stronger than that from organizational ones. News professionals (including news executives and news staffers) and news censors share similar news perception but audiences do not. Meanwhile, news staffers are more susceptible by their supervisors news perceptions while news executives concern more about censors news judgments. Interestingly, news censors news judgments, although significantly correlated with news professionals, are not well reflected in the news coverage. Audiences news judgments are neither correlated with news professionals nor reflected in the news coverage."

The Games cost a huge amount to stage and produce massive revenues from television, sponsors and admissions. In the majority of Olympic Games, a considerable burden of the cost falls on local and national tax payers. While the media typically pay a considerable amount of attention to all Olympic related issues, including finance, this paper considers the extent to which the media are fulfilling the role of watchdog in the public interest. In the case of London 2012, the British media devoted much space between November 2006 and May 2007 on the issue of the dramatically inflated budget for the games. However, very little focus fell on the disbursement of this budget. The media did not pursue the question, who gains ?

The Gendered Use of Telephones at the Bottom of the Pyramid,Race and Gender Effects in Technology Use,"Much has been said about womens access to and use of the telephone. Many studies conclude that a significant gender divide in access exists particularly in developing countries. Women are also said to use telephones in a different manner from men making and receiving more calls, spending more time on calls, and using telephones primarily for relationship maintenance purposes, while men make fewer calls, shorter calls and use telephones primarily for instrumental purposes. However, much of this research on usage patterns is based on small-sample studies in affluent developed countries. The article provides evidence that a significant gender divide in access to telephones exists in Pakistan and India, to a lesser extent in Sri Lanka, but is generally absent in the Philippines and Thailand. This article also challenges some of the findings of studies which claim that womens and mens use is fundamentally different, shedding light on womens access to and use of telecom services at the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) in five Emerging Asian markets. The article is based on an 8,600+ sample study of telephone users in Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Thailand, focusing on the BOP, but also looking at the middle and top of the pyramid to ascertain whether these findings are unique to the BOP or not."

The concept of credibility was assessed in two ways: expertise and trustworthiness. A 2 (source title: investor relations-IR vs. public relations-PR) X 2 (company situation: positive vs. negative) factorial experiment was conducted. Expertise of the IR and PR source was not differentiated. The source and the affiliated company were also perceived as more trustworthy in the company-positive situation than the company-negative situation. When the IR source represented the company, participants rated the affiliated company as more trustworthy than when the PR source represented it. The use of a specialist (e.g., IR) rather than the PR practitioner as a spokesperson would not affect the publics evaluation of expertise toward the affiliated company but affect trustworthiness of the affiliated company. Practical implications are discussed."
2008-1709,Whos Responsible for the Digital Divide? Public Perceptions and Policy Implications,Digital Inclusion and Exclusion,,,,Paper,Whos Responsible for the Digital Divide? Public Perceptions and Policy Implications,Digital Inclusion and Exclusion,"The goals of this paper are twofold. First, we are concerned with unpacking the term digital divide and examining how it has been employed across a range of academic and policy discourse. In our examination, we identify two master frames, or interpretations, of the digital divide. One focuses on ICT infrastructure and the inequalities in physical access to ICT, the other on human capacity and inequalities in skill to use ICT effectively.
The second goal of this paper is to examine the possible ramifications of these two dominant conceptualizations on public perceptions of the digital divide, especially in terms of whom or what the public holds accountable for addressing it. Employing a framing experiment embedded within a national survey, we test how presenting audiences with these two different conceptualizations lead to very different public perceptions of how to fundamentally address this problem from a policy perspective. We conclude by discussing the implications for ICT policy and communicating effectively about the digital divide to the general public."

A Fieldstudy of Interactive Technology and Surveillance,Technology and Privacy,"Information technology and new media allow for the collection and sharing of personal information at unprecedented levels. This study explores how people think about privacy issues when using new interactive technologies. Based on a year-long qualitative field study, this project examines how people conceptualize privacy and surveillance when using mobile social network systems. Consistent with previous privacy research, informants indicated they were not concerned about their privacy because they felt they had control of their personal information. Nevertheless, fieldwork and interviews indicated three kinds of surveillance present in their everyday usage of the mobile social network systems: voluntary Panopticon, lateral surveillance, and self-surveillance. This study sheds light on the everyday conceptions and meanings of surveillance and interactive technology."
2008-1711,"Who Taught Me That? Blog Structure, Information Recall, and Source Identification","Blogs, Chats, E-Mail, and Wikis",,,,Extended Abstract,"Who Taught Me That? Blog Structure, Information Recall, and Source Identification","Blogs, Chats, E-Mail, and Wikis","Changes in the information society, especially the rise of blogs and other citizen media, have refocused attention on questions of media modality, message recall, and source identification in online environments. This paper asks whether the argument structure of blog commentary on press accounts influences information recall from these sources and readers ability to identify the source of this information and whether this effect is conditioned on differences in information processing. We expect that those with a higher motivation to process, such those high in need for cognition or in an ideologically incongruent message condition, will be unaffected by message structure due to their greater processing effort, whereas structure will have a greater influence on those low in need for cognition or in an ideologically congruent condition. We find a main effect for ideological incongruence and interactive effects of structure with both need for cognition and ideological incongruence on source identification, centered on the ability to identify information from the blogger. Further, we find that, beyond a main effect for incongruence, structure and need for cognition interact, such that interspersed structure generated the highest levels of skepticism of the blogger among high need for cognition individuals but the lowest levels among those low in need for cognition. If an interspersed structure suppresses source identification and skepticism among low information processors, they may be accepting information as factual without carefully considering its merits. This may have important implications for democratic functioning and decision-making given the changing nature of online news environments."

Intercultural educators are often unprepared for the challenges white students assert during conversations about racism and are unsure how to reply appropriately. Herein, we offer examples of student responses to critical race pedagogy to order to assist teachers in addressing similar stories told in their own classrooms. Based on data collected from over 300 student assignments collected between fall 2003 and fall 2006, we present a typology that categorizes patterns of white student resistance, including acknowledgement of racism, white self-preservation, diversion from structural power and investment in white supremacy."

Forty-four parents and adolescents engaged in discussions about sex. The results from observational coding of these discussions revealed that when parents were receptive, informal, and composed during the conversations, their adolescents were less avoidant and anxious. The extent to which the parent was affiliative and dominant, however, did not influence the adolescents avoidance and anxiety. The findings also indicated that the childs perception of the parents communication competence, rather than the parents perception of his/her own competence, was predictive of the childs anxiety and avoidance. Nevertheless, parents who perceived that they were communicatively competent felt less anxious during the interactions. The quality of the relationship between the parent and the child also did not influence whether or not they chose to talk about the sex card, but it did influence how anxious and avoidant the child was during the conversation. Finally, supplementary qualitative analyses revealed that religiosity, the gender of the child and the use of sarcasm, enmeshment, fear appeals, and norms of the childs friends were also factors that appeared to shape the nature of the conversations."

Hence, an important question is how we react to the mishaps or setbacks of others. We may often feel sympathy, but sometimes we experience pleasure or so-called Schadenfreude following anothers misfortune. Frijda (1988) argues that an event will only elicit positive emotions when it serves self-relevant motives. In line with this notion, we argue that anothers misfortune may serve peoples striving for a positive self-evaluation. Accordingly, two experiments show that people experience more schadenfreude following anothers misfortune in the media after failure feedback on a self-relevant task rather than when no feedback (Study 1) or success feedback (Study 2) is provided. Moreover, Study 2 shows that this effect is stronger for individuals with chronic low self-esteem, thereby providing further evidence for a self-enhancing motive underlying the experience of schadenfreude following anothers misfortune in the media."

This paper attempts to fully grasp all the dimensions of the phenomenon bringing these different perspectives together. Looking at the specific case of France, the paper examines both the industrial and cultural obstacles to the production of quality French series. A comparison of the aesthetic and narrative features of two major police drama series currently aired in France, the American-purchased CSI: Miami and the French produced Julie Lescaut, shows that French series lag behind American series quality-wise. Although economic factors account in large part for these differences in quality, cultural factors, such as TV series low culture label in the French public sphere, play an important role, as they make it difficult for producers to fully embrace the genre and excel."

For these goals, two survey studies were conducted. In study 1, 152 participants were asked to compose an email message for a situation where a favor was asked. In study 2, 634 participants were asked to fill out one of four versions of a questionnaire, which included a prototype of an email message for the situation described in study 1 and negative and positive face threats measurements. The findings showed that 1) a greater number of Japanese included apologies in their favor asking messages while a greater number of American messages contained, 2) Americans had stronger intentions to use thanks in their favor asking messages than did Japanese, whereas Japanese had stronger intentions to use an apology than Americans did, and 3) including an apology and/or thanks reduced the amount of some types of face threat perceived in favor asking message. Finally, implications and future research directions were discussed."

In this paper, we explore the tension that is set up when projects are implemented. We argue for an explanation that recognizes the density of organization as a set of communication practices, manifested in the ongoing conversation of members, but grounded in a different interpretation, of lived organization as a manifestation of texts. Using a case study, we illustrate the effects of attempts to supplant the native text by an ""invader"": that of the technology."

It looks at how these wives came to construct the concept of being wife and how they felt themselves changed through being wives. Grounded on Social Construction Theory, the study reveals that Muslim and Christian wives have various aspects of convergence in terms of the use of verbal communication, concept and understanding of their roles of being wives, attitude towards conflict and how they manage it. To boot, husbands and wives define their power positions in marital partnerships through interaction and communication. Thus, a wife who negotiates gets more influences, however issue of religion still controls over connubial affairs."

However, it is not often recognized as a vibrant online community that engages in complex self-governance through proposing, discussing, agreeing on, and enforcing their own policies. Despite their vehement claim that ?Wikipedia is not a democracy,? much of what Wikipedians advocate in their description of policy-making is in line with theories of democratic deliberation. This paper compares the policy making processes on the English Wikipedia with the conceptual definition of democratic deliberation in order to understand how deliberative the policy making in Wikipedia is and also consider the ways in which the wiki environment challenges or expands our scholarly conceptions of deliberative interaction. Methods include a combination of content analysis of policy-making discussions and social network analysis of the wikipedians involved in these discussions. Content analysis shows that the discussions studied demonstrated a relatively high level of problem analysis and providing of information, but results were mixed in the group?s demonstration of respect, consideration, and mutual comprehension. Network visualizations of the discussion thread discern patterns in the interaction structure that can be useful in examining issues of equality and the influence that individual members have over the conversation. The combination of measures have implications for future research in deliberation in online and face-to-face settings."

The results indicate that a countrys economic power measured by its GDP and foreign direct investment in the US, its cultural and political similarity to the US in terms of religion, language and political freedom, as well as its public relations effort (the number of PR-related contracts with the United States) are significant factors that influence the coverage valence of the country in the US media. More importantly, a countrys cultural and political similarity and US medias coverage valence of the country are very significant and influential factors that decide Americans favorable opinions toward the country. There is no direct effect of public relations on public opinion; the impact of other countries public relations effort on Americans opinion has to go through mass media to take effect."
2008-1722,Witnessing as a Field,"Rhetoric, Witnessing, and the Constitution of Politics",,,,Paper,Witnessing as a Field,"Rhetoric, Witnessing, and the Constitution of Politics","Witnessing has recently become a contested issue in media scholarship, denoting a complex practice midway between experience and agency. Occupying a distinctive place in contemporary media studies, witnessing combines the evolution of media technologiesof production, transmission and representationwith weighty questions of morality and audience responsibility. Arguably the very definition of what it means to be a witness nowadays has changed with the expansion of media technologies. This article is an attempt to rethink the stakes and implications involved in media witnessing. It might be beneficial to open by foregrounding the main points to be developed in the following: (1) Witnessing, we suggest, is subject to constant contest, and is hence an inherently political practice. (2) We regard the act of witnessing as contingent upon the specific event witnessed; thus the ontology of witnessing is dependent on its context, as different events foster different modalities of witnessing. (3) As a political practice relative to a specific event, witnessing transpires in what Pierre Bourdieu (1977) designates as a field; thus witnessing is cast as a field comprising of various agents, interests, positions, and resources. (4) The field of witnessing operates in terms of trust, which is the basic currency among the agents in the field and the object for which they compete. The final section of this article will be devoted to a case study: an analysis of the fields of witnessing constructed by two documentary films produced shortly after the battle in Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank in March 2002."

How Men and Women Use Tentative Language Differently, Similarly, and Counterstereotypically as a Function of Gender Salience",Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,"Based on self-categorization theorys explanation for gender-based language use, an experiment had male and female participants send e-mail on a masculine, feminine or gender neutral topic to an ostensible male or female recipient (i.e., mixed-sex/intergroup or same-sex/intragroup dyads). Hypotheses focused tentative language use across the conditions as a function of gender salience. As predicted, the topic impacted if and how men and women used tentative language differently. For masculine topics, traditional gender differences emerged (i.e., women were more tentative than men) in intergroup, but not intragroup, contexts; for feminine topics, however, differences were counter-stereotypical (i.e., men were more tentative than women) in intergroup, but not intragroup, contexts; and for a gender neutral topic, no differences resulted in either intra- or intergroup contexts. Moreover, gender salience mediated these effects: The topic indirectly impacted tentative language via gender salience, but in intergroup interactions only (i.e., a conditional indirect effect)."

The study also examined job satisfaction and life issues that might affect burnout, such as work-family conflict, perceived organizational support, job demands and role overload. Results indicate that women are suffering higher levels of exhaustion and lower levels of professional efficacy on the MBI-GS than men, and while there are no significant differences in job satisfaction, women have lower levels of perceived organizational support, and higher levels of job demands and role overall. Additionally, 62% of women who said they intend to leave journalism or answered dont know are experiencing classic signs of burnout with high levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization."

These are women in their 60s who are supposed to enjoy their responsibility-free life after they have done their jobs by raising their children and supporting their husbands. Now, they should be able to reconnect with their long-forgotten friends and start their new lives. However, instead of new life, they are called back into home, this time, by another group of women, their daughters. Their daughters, the new generation of women, who want both family and career, need somebody who can take care of their child so they can work. With inadequate support from the society, their mothers are the only option they can turn to. Plans for new life for the mothers have to be put aside. As these two generations of women manage their lives, together and separately, dialectical tensions are abundant. This paper particularly explored two types: dialectics within themselves and with each other. To examine their relationships and dialectical tensions in them, this study interviewed 18 women who were in the arrangement where mothers were raising their daughters kids. Both parties struggle with the dilemma they are facing: To have everything, daughter asks her mother for another sacrifice; mother is willing to do so but feels resentment for her own missed opportunity; as those inner struggles transpire, guilt, anger, and love are all present between these two women."

It suggests that despite the existential danger and the urgent need for human resources, the journalistic discourse supported exclusion of women from the public sphere in general, and from military mobilization in particular. The study demonstrates that newspapers employed several gender-biased discourse strategies that framed Israeli women as weak and hysterical, and sometimes even as ""beasts"" or the enemy from within. These discursive strategies served to represent woman as inept citizens and soldiers and, at the same time, to condemn them for not taking an active part in the collective effort"

Our research traces a parallel diffusion of market logic, in the form of a culture of entrepreneurialism, into womens unwaged domestic affective labor in the home. Taking the multimedia Dr. Phil empire of advice books, a TV program, and a companion web site as our case study, situate the diffusion of managerial rationales and techniques for producing the emotional health, stability and well-being of the postfeminist family within a climate of neoliberal social policy, including George Bushs Healthy Marriage Initiative. We show how the Dr. Phil program of strategic and purposeful simultaneously genders and mobilizes affective labor in the service of welfare privatization, and how the Dr. Phil corporation in turn relies on womens affective labor to produce its immaterial productthe Dr. Phil brand. We show how the synergy and interactivity of ""convergence culture"" makes Dr. Phil's brand of self help possible, enabling the extraction of surplus value from the laborious self work Dr. Phil's customers perform on themselves as a condition of their freedom and empowerment."

In Greater Crenshaw, certain CBOs help develop ties between African American and Latino residents, while other organizations focus more on strengthening in-group ties. Media coverage of African American and Latino relations in Los Angeles tends to focus on violent stories of intergroup relations. This study, however, explores the less visible intergroup interaction occuring on grassroots levels. Through a content analysis of newspaper coverage, we establish the medias perspective of intergroup relations in the Crenshaw area and then compare these depictions to the stories told in interviews with staff and members of CBOs in the community."

A thematic analysis/constant comparative technique of the ?lived stories? of the participants revealed the messages about work regarding the various jobs that they have held and the sources that provided those messages. These messages about work and experiences with working influenced these African American women?s adjustment in the workplace. Prominent themes included: a) work was not an option, b) appropriate job/career, and c) why should they work. The analysis uncovered that these women provided various reasons why they should work, including: a) achieving more, b) doing it on their own, and c) having passion to do the job.

The Evolution of Public Broadcasting in Jamaica,Reflecting on Public Broadcasting and Community Journalism,,,,Paper,Would We Create It If It Did Not Exist? The Evolution of Public Broadcasting in Jamaica,Reflecting on Public Broadcasting and Community Journalism,"In many western democracies, public service broadcasting institutions (PSB) have long been criticised, their legitimacy thwarted by technological, cultural and political developments. However, while the future might appear bleak to those who have a nostalgic vision of PSB, more encouraging, forward-looking visions are possible. These visions are very important as we consider the persistent social impact of public service broadcasting institutions in various geo-political contexts.
As an example of forward-looking vision, this paper looks at the evolution of public broadcasting in Jamaica from the establishment of the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation in 1962, to its dismantlement in 1997, and to the formation of a new public broadcaster, the Jamaica Public Broadcasting Corporation (PBCJ), in 2006. Throughout this history, public service broadcasting continues to be a vital institution in Jamaican political and cultural life.
Some of the questions that spur from this history are: In an era characterised by the ever-expanding choice of media channels, while governments in wealthier countries are getting rid of their PSB, why is a new public broadcaster being re-established in Jamaica? What are its characteristics? Finally, could this attempt be indicative of broader trends pointing to the necessity of preserving, or re-creating, public spaces in commercially saturated media environments?
Although the lack of financial resources is a major challenge for the newly born PBCJ, efforts to re-build a public broadcaster speak to Jamaicas desire to create an alternative to commercial media. Attempts to create an efficient and socially relevant institution of public service broadcasting are discussed."

We look at the circumstances under which people are willing to share the resources on their edge devices using a technology with which they are not yet familiar. We collected data among students from a university in the North-Eastern USA (N=284) through a Policy Capturing design (also known as factorial design or conjoint measurement), and analyzed the information via Multilevel Regression Analysis. This approach allowed us to explore factors that explain the use of emerging peer-to-peer technologies among consumers as well as context-related characteristics. Context-related characteristics, in particular trust in communication partners, explain the willingness to share and, consequently, the use of Wireless Grids."

Drawing on the Montreal School of organizational communication?s literature, we attempt to explain the mechanisms by which contributors achieve that coherence and stability, showing that conversation and its sedimentation in texts are the locus of those practices. We will see that Taylor and Van Every?s (2000) text-conversational approach helps us see that in spite of the lack of pre-existing structures, Wikipedia contributors are not acting in a normative void."
2008-1740,"Writing Figures in the Field: The Parts Played by Women in the Making of Communications Research, 1941-1949",Communication and the Postwar Experience,,,,Paper,"Writing Figures in the Field: The Parts Played by Women in the Making of Communications Research, 1941-1949",Communication and the Postwar Experience,"World War II transformed media and communications research in fundamental ways. This paper looks at one aspect of that larger transformationthe contributions made by women researchers in the war and immediate postwar years, and their negotiation of academic roles over the course of the decade, focusing on the case of U.S. communications research. Drawing upon oral history interviews, archival research, and close reading of published texts, I argue that the war created opportunities for women to conduct meaningful work in media research, which a number of them seized upon, frequently operating within the institutional contexts of Columbia Universitys Bureau of Applied Social Research and the governments Office of War Information. Given that institutional space, these womenwhose stories have gone all but untoldmade important contributions to the development of research methodologies like content analysis, panel studies, and depth-oriented focused interviews. After the war, however, this opportunity structure contracted, men displaced women in academic settings, and the women took up roles in the domestic or commercial realmthus depriving the field, I argue, of some of its most talented qualitative researchers, at a crucial moment in its institutional development."
2008-1741,Writing the Intellectual History of Intercultural Communication,Histories of the Field of Communication,,,,Paper,Writing the Intellectual History of Intercultural Communication,Histories of the Field of Communication,"Some of the precursor research necessary to the later establishment of intercultural communication was conducted by anthropologists in the overlapping groups surrounding Margaret Mead and the Institute for Intercultural Studies through the 1930s and 1940s. Some of the assumptions are the same, as are some specific theoretical terms, research methods, and topics investigated. All of the pieces of the story of intercultural communication described have influenced our current study of this topic. It is what immigrants, international students, and foreign diplomats have in common that is the central concern: that specific moment when individuals with different cultural backgrounds come together, bringing with them the potential for grave misunderstandings. All of the strands of our history have influenced modern day research, and play a role in our tacit assumptions. It is my contention that we must spend at least a little time clarifying what our own assumptions are, and how these have developed over time. Multiple strands of research have influenced what we study today and how we study it; they should all be documented so that we learn all of our own history."
2008-1742,"You are What You (Dont) Eat? Food, Identity, and Resistance",cholar to Scholar: Feminist Scholarship Division Interactive Paper Poster Session,,,,Paper,"You are What You (Dont) Eat? Food, Identity, and Resistance",Scholar to Scholar: Feminist Scholarship Division Interactive Paper Poster Session,"This paper connects personal, social and cultural frames of resistant performances and performativities. Specifically, it focuses on the politics of food resistance, and of autonomy and individual/collective change. Through Foucault, the essay traces the history of technologies of self as they relate food to the performativity of everyday life. Borrowing from de Certeau, the essay outlines strategic performances around food that re-center positions of dominance in society, as well as those that offer openings into alternative positions relative to the center. The essay is both broad and particular in its coverage in an attempt to differentiate de Certeaus concepts of strategic and tactical practices, alternatively represented as social problems or social movements."
2008-1743,"Young Childrens Fright Reactions to Violence, War, and Conflict in the News",Examining Media Effects in Children,,,,Paper,"Young Childrens Fright Reactions to Violence, War, and Conflict in the News",Examining Media Effects in Children,"A survey was conducted of 218 children in kindergarten through sixth grade regarding their fright reactions to violence, war, and conflict in the news. Results showed that 35.3% of children reported being frightened by the news. In spite of its topical prominence, war was rarely mentioned spontaneously. Reporting on what frightened them in their own words, the most frequent news topics were natural disasters (24.7% of children frightened by news), followed by kidnappings (10.4%), the War in Iraq (7.8%) and burglaries (7.8%0); 33.8% of frightened children referred to people being hurt or killed. Family rules and the home viewing environment were generally unrelated to news exposure and fear from news. Implications for parental guidance and research methods are discussed."
2008-1744,Young Peoples Use of Mobile Phones: A British Perspective,Connecting with Generation Y-ired: Global Perspectives on New Media and Youth Cultures,,,,Paper,Young Peoples Use of Mobile Phones: A British Perspective,Connecting with Generation Y-ired: Global Perspectives on New Media and Youth Cultures,"This panel paper reports on a British study that was conducted in 2007 looking at teenagers use of mobile phones. It shows the diversity in the degree to which young people communicate, to bring some perspective to any claims about the connectivity of this generation. It underlines some of the constraints on young peoples communication, most particularly financial ones, but also constraints on usage at school and in some other social settings. The paper provides a picture of change over time as texting, even in a European country, competes against functional and increasingly fashionable alternatives such as instant messaging. Lastly, although the communications dimension has been the chief focus, it is important to bear in mind how the mobile is being used for multiple purposes, some of which relate to childrens use of the Internet.

2008-1745,Youth Engaged by ICTs for Social Change and Development: Participation as Empowerment and Manipulation,Globalisation: The Next Generation,,,,Paper,Youth Engaged by ICTs for Social Change and Development: Participation as Empowerment and Manipulation,Globalisation: The Next Generation,"Since the 1970s, participation has been a key concept in development initiatives and state-funded projects of social change worldwide. In recent years, the interactive potential of ICTs has nourished optimistic (at times enthusiastic) expectations regarding their usefulness as tools of participatory involvement. The seeming ease with which young people embrace ICTs and the obvious extent of user-generated content contributed by youth has further underwritten this prospect. This presentation will challenge some of the technology- and media-centric understandings of these claims and outline a more contextualized understanding of ICT-facilitated processes of participation. Of key theoretical importance will be a mapping of different types and qualities of active participation spanning from more consumption-based practices of sharing mediated experience and information to collective forms of ICT-supported social mobilisations. In empirical terms, my arguments are substantiated by preliminary findings from a field study in Nepal early 2008.

2008-1746,YouTube and an Atlantic Canadian Public Sphere,Analyzing YouTube: Multidisciplinary Approaches,,,,Paper,YouTube and an Atlantic Canadian Public Sphere,Analyzing YouTube: Multidisciplinary Approaches,"There is not much written about the use of either video or online video as a forum for democratic engagement or discourse. Drawing on Nancy Frasers expanded version of Habermas public sphere (1996), user-generated online video is a dynamic information and communication technology (ICT) that holds the promise of interactive expression as a virtual public sphere. For the roundtable, I will present the theoretical basis, methods used and findings of our study of the content and the responses of YouTube users to YouTube videos. The study focuses on issues of regional identity, levels of political engagement and public sphere expression. Data gathered from 60 YouTube users and a random sampling from the complete YouTube population of Atlantic Canadian videos and their comments collected within a two week period in 2006, were analyzed for public sphere content. The findings show that there continues to be an important connection between geo-political identity and issues of public concern, and the potential for user generated online video as a public sphere depends on the recognition that viewer engagement with the content is affected by the style and quality of presentation as well as the subject matter."
2008-1747,YouTube and Mainstream Journalism: Strange Bedfellows?,Journalism Ethics,,,,Paper,YouTube and Mainstream Journalism: Strange Bedfellows?,Journalism Ethics,"This study is one of the very few that have looked into the unethical activity of posting and sharing videos of human rights violations on websites like YouTube. Eleven videos were sampled from 9,109 videos that resulted from an intensive search on YouTube. Results show that inappropriate human rights violation videos are currently on the website and are very much accessible to anyone who knows how to use the Internet despite the fact that the user guidelines specifically state that YouTube does not accept offensive videos. This problem does not end here; this unethical practice affects mainstream journalists as well and would continue to do so as more and more people turn to the Internet for news and information. This study looked into how the YouTube phenomenon is proving to be a big challenge to mainstream journalists in the course of fulfilling their responsibility of informing the people while at the same time, minimizing harm."
2008-1748,YouTube Vlogs and Gender,Analyzing YouTube: Multidisciplinary Approaches,,,,Paper,YouTube Vlogs and Gender,Analyzing YouTube: Multidisciplinary Approaches,"Producing and sharing user-generated video, known as ""video blogging,"" has recently become popular with millions of people. Video blogs, also known as ""vlogs,"" are blogs executed in video rather than textual form. This study analyzes a random sample of 100 short vlogs posted to YouTube, investigating how and why people communicate using vlogs. In particular I examine potential uses of user-generated video for women and how women are creating vlogs. This study employs a media content analysis to explore who is vlogging, how they vlog, what they are vlogging about, and the influence of gender on these variables. The analysis suggests that, while there are fewer female vloggers than male vloggers, female vloggers displayed similar levels of technical skill in their videos and were more likely to communicate with the vlogging community. The study also details potential challenges in conducted gender analysis of YouTube videos, which include viral videos, and misrepresentations in self-identification while discussing the benefits and limitations of using media content analysis to analyze vlogs."
