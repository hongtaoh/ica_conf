2009-0001,100 World Trade Center Bombings in Darfur Sudan: Ownership Structure and Functions of the Press in a Globalizing World,Contemporary Perspectives on the Performance of the Press,,,,Paper,100 World Trade Center Bombings in Darfur Sudan: Ownership Structure and Functions of the Press in a Globalizing World,Contemporary Perspectives on the Performance of the Press,"To examine news medias coverage of the Darfur crisis during its first 26 months (January, 2003-February, 2005), textual and quantitative content analyses were conducted of articles in eight news dailies (Egypts Al Ahram Daily, Chinas China Daily and Peoples Daily, the UKs Guardian, Frances Le Monde, South Africas Mail and Guardian, and the US New York Times and Washington Post). Those articles with more than 50% of their paragraphs on Darfur were included in the sample (N = 705). The results indicated that the newspapers comprehensiveness of coverage of the crisis varied based on their countries national interests with Sudan, ownership (i.e., state owned or private), and the political-linguistic nature of their readership (i.e., native language for local readership, or English for national and foreign elites)."

2009-0018,A Birth of Bureaucratic Organizational Culture in Early Korean Broadcasting,The Long Mid-20th Century in Communication History,,,,Paper,A Birth of Bureaucratic Organizational Culture in Early Korean Broadcasting,The Long Mid-20th Century in Communication History,"This study explored the formation of organizational culture of early broadcasting in Korea which adopted Western broadcasting institution. The Seoul Television (now KBS) sent its first wave on December 31st, 1961 as a state-run broadcasting by the military government. Many aspects of early broadcasting history have been unexplored, including why and how the government started television broadcasting with extreme lack of financial and human resources.
Based upon oral interviews with early broadcasting professionals and production staffs, the study shed a new light on how and why the military government had rushed to start television broadcasting. From the interview with Choi, who prepared the foundation of KBS-TV, this study found that a professional production culture at the institutional level had been thwarted by the pressure from the military government to start the service on December 24th for the political symbol as a Christmas present for the nation.
Through the withdrawal process of skilled staff from HLKZ-TV after promulgation of the reorganization plan on February 5th 1962, the bureaucratic organizational system in which administrative staffs gain an upper hand over professional staff was settled. After the departure of staff from HLKZ-TV, incoming staff has taken charge of both producing and directing of programs. With this change in production, the unique PD system, in which a director holds a superior position to a producer under the shortage of experienced television production staff, has been established. Such a bureaucratic culture of broadcasting organization has made huge influence ways of in Korean broadcasting institution."
2009-0019,A Brown Womans Standpoint: Feminist Standpoint Theory and the Search for Voice in American Academia,"Feminist Voices, Histories, and Cross-Cultural Interactions",,,,Paper,A Brown Womans Standpoint: Feminist Standpoint Theory and the Search for Voice in American Academia,"Feminist Voices, Histories, and Cross-Cultural Interactions","Feminist standpoint theory, once a highly debated topic of discussion, has intrigued scholars for decades. In recent years the interest in the potential contributions of the theory appears to have diminished. In this paper, I first discuss the theory itself and then, I locate my own standpoint which continues to remain a work-in-progress, straddled between identities and the quest for validation. In doing so, I wonder if such a thing as a Brown-skinned Asian womans standpoint even exists in American academia."
2009-0020,Academic Internet Use: Issues and Lessons in e-Research,ternet Use & Abuse,,,,Paper,Academic Internet Use: Issues and Lessons in e-Research,Internet Use & Abuse,"Since the 1995 inception of the Internet in South Korea, the Internet has become an important medium for information and communication among collegians due to its complete integration into everyday school lives. This study examines the scholarly use and role of advanced computer and communications technologies in general and the Internet in particular via an open-ended, qualitative survey among Korean university students. Through word frequency analysis and semantic mapping, this paper identifies the key issues in academic Internet use. In addition to information science methods, content analysis is used to investigate the attitudinal and behavior dimensions in scholarly Internet use. The results are expected to enable professors and policymakers to target populations who underutilize the educational potential of Internet technologies and to design e-learning programs for such students."
2009-0021,Academic vs. Professional Education: Epistmology and Journalism Educator's Academic Work,Journalism Studies Poster Session,,,,Paper,Academic vs. Professional Education: Epistmology and Journalism Educator's Academic Work,Journalism Studies Poster Session,"This study was designed to examine journalism and mass communication educators personal epistemology and its influence on their academic work as educators. A case study was conducted that examined nine journalism and mass communication faculty members from varying educational and background experiences. Three separate categories were used to classify the faculty members: academic, industry, and adjunct. The results identified unique epistemologies for the faculty groups. The faculty members in the academic group commonly illustrated epistemological assumptions grounded in contextual relativism, whereas faculty members from the industry and adjunct categories more often demonstrated epistemological assumptions rooted in dualism. The different epistemological assumptions influenced faculty members academic work. The implications for journalism and mass communication educations are discussed."
2009-0022,A Chinese Folk Theory of Social Influence: Cultivating Moral Values in High Schools in Contemporary China,"Moral Values, Social Status, Stigma, and Internet: Related Communication in Four Cultures",,,,Paper,A Chinese Folk Theory of Social Influence: Cultivating Moral Values in High Schools in Contemporary China,"Moral Values, Social Status, Stigma, and Internet: Related Communication in Four Cultures","Using data collected through ethnographic methods, this study investigates how the Confucian code of morality provides a framework of frameworks (Goffman, 1986) for understanding and interpreting the social world of contemporary high schools in China. Influenced by the code of morality, moral education or Yu Ren is believed to be the foundation and the reason for Jiao Shu (academic education). Emerging out of various culturally persuasive forms of communicationrituals, storytelling, and Tan Xin (heart talk) is a Chinese folk theory of social influenceGan Huathat foreground concrete actions as means of cultivating moral selves in students. In the Gan Hua model, persuasion is conceptualized as an ongoing and persistent process of moving or touching the inner world of students so that they will be motivated to change, driven by culturally facilitative emotions such as gratitude, guilt, and shame."
2009-0023,A Cognitive Processing Explanation of the Disrupt-Then-Reframe Compliance Gaining Technique,Keywords in Information Systems: Cognitive Resources (High Density),,,,Paper,A Cognitive Processing Explanation of the Disrupt-Then-Reframe Compliance Gaining Technique,Keywords in Information Systems: Cognitive Resources (High Density),"Davis & Knowless (1999) disrupt-then-reframe technique (DTR) of increasing compliance gaining success increases the likelihood compliance by using a confusing phrase (the disruption) and following it with a reason to comply with the request (the reframe). Two experiments were conducted to contrast a Spinozan model of processing (Gilbert, 1991) explanation of the techniques effectiveness with an action identification theory (Vallacher & Wegner, 1985) explanation. Study one used the DTR to collect money for charity (80 women, 80 men). The DTR failed to increase rates of compliance but it did increase the average donation in a pattern consistent with the Spinozan predictions. Study two asked Ss to fill out a 20-minute survey (85 women, 139 men). The DTR only increased compliance for only one of the three experimenters but the pattern of results for that experimenter was again consistent with the Spinozan processing predictions."
2009-0024,"A Communication Competence Approach to Examining Healthcare Worker Conflict, Social Support, Stress, Burnout, and Job Satisfaction.",Communication in Healthcare Organizations,,,,Paper,"A Communication Competence Approach to Examining Healthcare Worker Conflict, Social Support, Stress, Burnout, and Job Satisfaction.",Communication in Healthcare Organizations,"Drawing upon Kreps (1988) Relational Health Communication Competence Model (RHCCM) and research on communication competence, conflict styles, and organizational outcomes related to conflict/stress in an effort to assess healthcare worker job satisfaction/burnout, the researchers conducted a survey of N =175 healthcare workers from three Veterans Administration hospitals in the United States. The results (stemming from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis and a regression analysis) found support for Kreps (1988) RHCCM model as well as for several hypotheses related to communication competence, conflict style, and job satisfaction/burnout. The implications of the findings for Kreps (1998) model and organizational conflict theory are discussed along with limitations of the study and directions for future research."
2009-0025,A Comparative Study of the N-Generations Mobile Phone Use: Between the U.S. and Korean Society,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,,,,Paper,A Comparative Study of the N-Generations Mobile Phone Use: Between the U.S. and Korean Society,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,"In the midst of ongoing discussions about youth groups new media usage, this study examined the N-Generations mobile phone use in terms of basic patterns, motivation, and functional usage between the U.S. and Korean society. Both the U.S. and Korean N-Generation showed large dependence on their parents for cell phone bill payments and the patterns of mobile phone uses for social relationships were similar between the two groups. The two N-Generation groups used the mobile phone very frequently regardless of time and place, but their wireless internet usage through the mobile phone device was low. A principal component analysis of motivation resulted in five significant dimensions of mobile phone use: Mixed, Multimedia, Personal Integrative, Social/Mobility, and Instrumental/Social. The U.S. N-Generation showed stronger motives in Multimedia and Instrumental/Social dimensions of mobile phone use and the Korean group had stronger motivation in Social/Mobility factor; the Personal Integrative motive was overall very weak in both groups. The similar patterns of mobile phone use found between the two groups could be understood in terms of the N-Generations cohort effect; however, the unique socio-cultural background of each society seems to influence those young peoples different motivation of mobile phone use."
2009-0026,"A Comparison of Gender Role Portrayals in Magazine Advertisements From Germany, Poland, and the United States",Top Papers in Visual Communication Studies,,,,Paper,"A Comparison of Gender Role Portrayals in Magazine Advertisements From Germany, Poland, and the United States",Top Papers in Visual Communication Studies,"This study investigates the presence of different types of gender roles (working and nonworking, functional, and dominance) in 1861 advertisements coming from German, Polish and American magazines published in 2007. A primary contribution of the paper is the cross-cultural comparison and the inclusion of two European countries in which gender roles in magazine advertising have not been studied previously.

All sampled ads were content analyzed and comparisons between genders were carried out separately for each genre in every country by chi-square analysis.

Our main results suggest that women and men are shown in different roles in magazine advertising. In particular, women are by comparison to men heavily underrepresented in recreational and family roles in most of the magazines analyzed. The most common nonworking roles for both men and women are decorative and actors are mostly presented in a symbolic association with the product. As far as dominance is concerned, equality between the genders is the most frequently found relationship in ads from all magazine genres.

Finally, we have found a clear standardization of the portrayed gender roles across magazine genres in all studied countries and very few similarities across different genres within individual countries. This result suggests that each genre portrays a unique set of gender roles. Hence, the collapsing of genres as it has been common in previous research may have hidden some underlying differences in gender roles between genres."
2009-0027,A Critical Cultural Analysis of YouTube: Power and Control in a Web 2.0 Interface,"tudying Visual Aspects of the Web: Usability, Aesthetics, and Ideology",,,,Paper,A Critical Cultural Analysis of YouTube: Power and Control in a Web 2.0 Interface,"Studying Visual Aspects of the Web: Usability, Aesthetics, and Ideology","This article looks into YouTube as one of the most popular Social Software platforms, challenging the dominant discourse with its focus on community formation and user empowerment. On the basis of an analysis of the steering mechanisms embodied in the infrastructure as well as empirical observations of YouTubes content fluctuations during a period of time, insight is provided into the embedded cultural values and practices and into the nature of the ongoing negotiation of power and control between the YouTube controllers (owners, designers, editors) and the prosumers. This exploratory study is theoretically inspired by Michel de Certeaus ideas of utilization as a productive activity involving strategic and tactical behaviour. Methodologically the model for hybrid media analysis (Pauwels 2005) is taken as a point of departure for analysing various aspects of the websites platform (including structure, design, hyperlinks, imagery, topics and issues). This model is geared towards decoding the multimodal structure of websites and their social and cultural significance."
2009-0028,A Cross-Cultural Approach to Serial Arguing in Dating Relationships: The Case of Malagasy Romantic Partners,"Corporate Social Responsibility, Serial Argument, Discussion Network: Crosscultural Comparisons",,,,Paper,A Cross-Cultural Approach to Serial Arguing in Dating Relationships: The Case of Malagasy Romantic Partners,"Corporate Social Responsibility, Serial Argument, Discussion Network: Crosscultural Comparisons","The current study represents the first cross-cultural replication of research in serial arguing. Some 224 participants recruited from Madagascar, and among members of the Malagasy Diasporas in France, Québec and the US completed a survey concentrating on several aspects of their cultural orientations, the perceived frequency of conflictual episodes, and their communication behaviors during serial arguments. The findings highlight the importance of within-cultural variations in terms of conflict behaviors. An emphasis on the vertical aspect of individualism was a significant predictor of (more)dominating, aggressive styles while an emphasis on the horizontal aspect of individualism and collectivism of a compromising style. A particularly intriguing finding is that an emphasis on individualism or collectivism did not have as a great impact as expected on serial arguing. Instead, the findings reported in the study tend to suggest that looking at the vertical and horizontal aspects of individualism and collectivism would be more useful."
2009-0029,A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Corporate Social Responsibility Practices in America and China,"Corporate Social Responsibility, Serial Argument, Discussion Network: Crosscultural Comparisons",,,,Paper,A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Corporate Social Responsibility Practices in America and China,"Corporate Social Responsibility, Serial Argument, Discussion Network: Crosscultural Comparisons","This study examines the cross-cultural similarities and differences of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices between leading America companies and leading Chinese companies. It pays particular attention to the why, what, how and where of CSR practices and discovers how these companies manage and localize their efforts through the comparison of corporate websites. Utilizing corporate websites to perform a content analysis, 50 of the top American Fortune 500 businesses were analyzed. The results from the fifty American Fortune 500 companies were then compared to 23 top Chinese Fortune 50 companies. The codebook elements that were used to compare CSR practices between America and China revealed few similarities and many differences. Through analyzing corporate websites, the results of this study revealed that leading American companies are more advanced in recording and implementing CSR efforts than leading Chinese companies."
2009-0030,A Cross-Level Theory of Media Effects: How the Economy Conditions Political Learning,"The Interplay Between the Media, the Economy, and Regulation",,,,Paper,A Cross-Level Theory of Media Effects: How the Economy Conditions Political Learning,"The Interplay Between the Media, the Economy, and Regulation","This paper argues that political economy has been overlooked as an important contextual element capable of coordinating the process and consequences of political communication. A theoretical model connecting micro-individual outcomes to macro-social functioning is proposed to capture the dynamic ecology of citizens political learning. In particular, the economic environment is theorized to impact voters political information seeking and holding via a series of mechanisms. It is maintained that the study of political communication can benefit from considering macro political economy variables, which can bring more explanatory power to models of political communication effects, test the degree of rationality of the electorate in response to varied social settings, and build a political communication effects theory that addresses both micro- and macro- factors."
2009-0031,A Crowded Newsroom: Social Capital and Deliberative Decision-Making on Wikipedia,Listening for the Wisdom of Crowds: New Media and New Forms of Knowledge,,,,Paper,A Crowded Newsroom: Social Capital and Deliberative Decision-Making on Wikipedia,Listening for the Wisdom of Crowds: New Media and New Forms of Knowledge,"Wikipedia has garnered considerable attention for its ability not only to cover traditional encyclopedic topics, but as a forum for synthesizing emerging information and breaking news stories. Wikipedia features an ""In The News"" section highlighting encyclopedia articles about current events where each news item is nominated, deliberated, and promoted by editors to the homepage. This paper/talk examines the extent to which the outcomes from this participatory process approximate professional expertise about information importance and salience by examining the extent to which Wikipedia's coverage of daily news items compares to coverage by other news outlets. Additionally, the paper attempts to quantify participant's social capital by employing a social network analysis of archived discussions to analyze individual editor's preferences and editing activity. The dynamics of participatory consensus-formation and their impact on deliberative outcomes have important implications in computer-supported collaborative work as well as computer-mediated organizational communication for knowledge synthesis, contextualization, and dissemination."

Negative emotions of fear, sadness, and anger, and positive emotions of hope and relief were analyzed for their associations with prevention and detection breast cancer behaviors. Messages that evoked fear were significantly more likely to be associated with detection behaviors while messages that evoked relief were significantly less likely to be associated with detection behaviors than messages that did not evoke these emotions. These results are consistent with control theory and show that friends and family are important sources of memorable messages about breast cancer."
2009-0033,"Action Theory, Theory of Planned Behavior, and Media Choice",Evolving Perspectives on Media Choice,,,,Paper,"Action Theory, Theory of Planned Behavior, and Media Choice",Evolving Perspectives on Media Choice,"Action theory regards people as decision-makers who follow intentions and voluntarily pursue their goals. Uses-and-gratifications, one of the most popular approaches towards media choice, shares many action-theoretical ideas, but has been criticized in the past to lack theoretical substance. An adaptation of the social-psychological Theory of Planned Behavior (TOPB) is suggested to improve the conceptual level of action-theoretical approaches towards media choice. The TOPB predicts voluntary media choice on the basis of peoples intentions, respectively their attitudes, norms, and capabilities. The TOPB promises to predict between 20% and 40% of the variance in individual media choice. The presentation reviews existing studies that linked the TOPB to media choice in the past, stresses major advantages of the conceptual model, but also critically discusses potential caveats  like the role of impulsive choices or automatic habitual media exposure.

2009-0034,Active Audience and Automatic Usage: A Test of Rival Hypotheses on Automaticity of Internet Use,ternet Use & Abuse,,,,Paper,Active Audience and Automatic Usage: A Test of Rival Hypotheses on Automaticity of Internet Use,Internet Use & Abuse,"Active audience is a prevailing view in media research, which implies rational (i.e., non-automatic) use of media. However, the relationship between active audience and automatic usage has been rarely examined in communication research. The study makes the first attempt to unravel the mechanism behind habitual/automatic Internet use and to answer a research question that is generalizable to the use of other media: will automatic use reduce or improve audience activeness? The research question is operationalized as a comparison of two competing sets of hypotheses on automaticity: replacement perspective and coexistence perspective. A test based on three annual surveys of Internet use in Hong Kong shows that the degree of activeness by Internet users does not go down as their Internet use becomes increasingly automatic, which supports the coexistence hypothesis. The findings can be interpreted by instance theory of automaticity (Logan, 1988)."
2009-0035,Actor-Partner Effects for the Associations Between Relationship Characteristics and Reactions to Sex in Marriage,Top 4 interpersonal papers,,,,Paper,Actor-Partner Effects for the Associations Between Relationship Characteristics and Reactions to Sex in Marriage,Top 4 interpersonal papers,This study extends the relational turbulence model to the context of marriage to explore dyadic effects between characteristics of romantic relationships and emotional and cognitive reactions to sex. We surveyed both spouses from 220 married couples about characteristics of their relationship and their perceptions of sexual intimacy. Results indicated that (a) relational uncertainty and interference from partners were negatively associated with sexual satisfaction and positively associated with negative cognitive and emotional reactions to sex; (b) an actors sexual satisfaction was negatively associated with the partners relational uncertainty and interference from partners; (c) an actors negative cognition about sex was positively associated with the partners relational uncertainty and interference from partners; and (d) an actors negative emotion following sex was positively associated with the partners relational uncertainty. Our findings highlight dyadic interdependence between actors and partners perceptions of the relationship and reactions to sexual intimacy.

Theoretical arguments grounded in the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) culminated in the positing of a series of interactions between message (juvenalian, horatian, traditional opinion-editorial) and recipient ability (high, low) relative to three outcome variables: perceived humor, counterarguing, and attitudes concerning Hillary Clintons universal health care plan. An experiment was conducted during the 2008 Democratic primary election. The message-by-ability interactions revealed a need to step beyond the study of satire as monolithic; different types of satire produce divergent effects depending on the ability of the audience member. Future lines of research and the need for additional theory building are discussed."

Because offering the service alone has failed to increase testing, more efforts have to be undertaken to understand other factors that may affect individuals willingness to be tested. This study tested two hypotheses: (a) that HIV-related stigma would function as a barrier to and that knowledge and self-efficacy would serve as facilitators of testing uptake, and (b) that a comprehensive behavior-change campaign, such as the Malawi BRIDGE Project, would be associated with lower levels of stigma and higher levels of knowledge and self-efficacy among the general public. Data were drawn from cross-sectional surveys conducted as part of formative and midterm evaluation of the Malawi BRIDGE Project. Baseline data (N = 891) were collected from eight districts in Malawi, and midterm data (N = 881) were collected from four districts after intervention activities had occurred for two years. We found that HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, self-efficacy, and lack of stigma were positively associated with HIV testing. A positive association was also found between program exposure, on the one hand, and knowledge, self-efficacy and lack of HIV/AIDS-related stigma, on the other hand. Findings inform researchers, policy-makers, and communities that important psychosocial variables, including knowledge, stigma, and self-efficacy, are linked with peoples likelihood of HIV testing, and that these variables can be influenced by means of comprehensive behavior-change programs."

A comparative framework was used, allowing to observe parrallels and differences with the motivations of adolescent gamers. The results of this study indicate that, although adolescents, and more specifically, adolescent males, spend considerably more time behind the computer or console, both adults and adolescents display a number of similarities in their preferences for certain types of game content. Although adult players tend to ascribe a higher value to games that contain a puzzle element, and although adolescent players tend to ascribe a higher value to games that contain a sports element, both categories are similar in their preference for artistic game content, and in their tendency to appreciate games that contain a fiction element. In conclusion, a developmental perspective is proposed to assess the differences between adult and adolescent players, considering both categories not as conceptually distinct types of gamers, but rather as subgroups that are comparable in many respects."

After controlling for demographics, it was clear that school, home communication environment, and motives were the drivers of political socialization. Motives completely mediated the effect of television, internet, and print news use."

Predictors were assessed in the adolescents 7th grade year. A year later, adolescents reported their top three favorite movies and television shows. Profiles of media genre preference were created from these media favorites reports, and adolescents were grouped according to their like-profiles (e.g., adventure-sports, sports-thriller, romance-mystery-drama, no preferences). Gender, family environment and coping styles were the key predictors of media genre preference patterns. Other factors predicted just one or two patterns."

The aspects of sexuality under study include attitudes towards love and relationships, stereotypes of gender role and standards of attractiveness. The central contention is that the role of media in the formation of sexuality during adolescence can only be fully understood within the context of the adolescents life experience in school, at home and with friends. A questionnaire survey was conducted in Shanghai, China. Based on cluster sampling strategy, 1428 students from nine secondary schools participated in the study. The media appear to be strong predictors of adolescent perceptions of sexuality; this is interrelated with other influential factors like school, family and friends in important ways. The findings were illustrated in a structural equation model, which also demonstrated significant associations between the perceptions about sexuality and influential factors other than media, including school, family and friends. By comparing the respective contribution of all of these factors, it was found that friends have the greatest role in shaping adolescent perceptions of sexuality, while media have the second strongest. Both of these are much stronger predictors than are school or family."

This study examines the barriers to adoption of NAIS and RFID technology as risk-reduction tools. Diffusion of innovation literature is used to analyze a case study of a state livestock association advocating the rejection of NAIS and RFID technology. Implications for the diffusion of risk reduction tools are provided."
2009-0044,Advertising in the Alternative Media Field of Production,Journalism Studies Poster Session,,,,Paper,Advertising in the Alternative Media Field of Production,Journalism Studies Poster Session,"The present study problematizes the flattened idea of media advertiser, which is no more universal than any other component of the forces of production, mapping advertising as a small component of a larger field, involving a wild array of competitive forces and position-takings. It recommends adding to prominent theories of alternative media the important influence of alternative advertising as significantly varying from the mainstream model as do the already elaborated dimensions of content, form, reprographics, use, social relations, and communication processes. The study uses ethnographic methods with advertisers to three different types of alternative media  a social progressive print weekly, an ethnic news daily, and a bimonthly environmental paper  to elaborate media advertising as part of dialectical and dialogic field, rather than a monolithic institution. Although mass communications scholars frequently posit advertising as a homogenous force, the data were generally suggestive of differences among media subtypes. Advertising is a different practice in different locations. And it should be understood that its determinative effects ought necessarily to follow and be equally variable as those differences. Some themes included are associations with ideological content, the explicit rejection of mainstream media, advertiser content control, ethical restraints, and advertiser insider or outsider status. The present study addresses the void in research on advertiser motivations, elaborating on the nature of alternative media advertising relative to its field."

In this study, we examined the degree to which college students in Singapore misconceive their peers attitudes toward material possessions. The data for this study came from a paper-and-pencil survey involving a random sample of 497 college students in Singapore. The results indicate widespread evidence of pluralistic ignorance; that is, students believed that their peers were significantly more materialistic than was actually the case. The data also suggest that the students formed such erroneous impressions of peers on the basis, in part, of the students advertising consumption and of the students own materialistic values."
2009-0046,Affect as a Predictor of Entertainment Choice: The Utility of Looking Beyond Pleasure,Evolving Perspectives on Media Choice,,,,Paper,Affect as a Predictor of Entertainment Choice: The Utility of Looking Beyond Pleasure,Evolving Perspectives on Media Choice,"Research concerning the affective predictors of entertainment selection has tended to operate under the assumption that viewers choices reflect hedonistic concernsthe maximization of pleasure and the alleviation of negative affect. Yet numerous studies have shown that under some circumstances, individuals in negative or sad moods appear to have a distinct taste for entertainment frequently associated with negative emotions (e.g., sad films, tragedies, mournful love songs). This presentation will overview a variety of possible explanations for these seemingly paradoxical findings. Among these explanations are ones resting on the utility of prolonging negative affective states, ones focusing on implications of affect as information, and ones considering the implications of viewers faulty abilities at affective forecasting. Ultimately, this presentation will suggest that research in this area would benefit from a broader conceptualization of affective predictors and emotional responses to media  ones that focus on meaningfulness as an additional gratification beyond hedonic pleasure.

2009-0047,Affective States and Message Frames,Keywords in Information Systems: Framing (High Density),,,,Paper,Affective States and Message Frames,Keywords in Information Systems: Framing (High Density),"Because there is inconclusive evidence on the influence of prior affective states on message frame, this study provides a first test of the effects of positive and negative affective states on the reception of gain- versus loss-framed health messages. Overall, Experiments 1 and 2 provided converging evidence that a negative affective state led to a stronger behavioral intention than a positive affective state. A significant interaction of affective states and message frame was found. A positive affective state and a loss frame led to a stronger behavioral intention, whereas a negative affective state and a loss frame led to a stronger behavioral intention. These findings were congruent with the perspective that happy people are concerned about losses and thus a loss frame would be more persuasive (Isen & Geva, 1987).
Both experiments provided compelling evidence that involvement moderated the interaction of affective states and message frame. In particular, at high involvement, loss frame/positive affective state and loss frame/negative affective state led to a stronger behavioral intention. These findings support the notion that happy people are more receptive to self-relevant threatening information (Raghunathan & Trope, 2002)."

The findings showed that the potential user group had overall higher motivations and stronger content interest in Mobile TV viewing of specific genres than did the other three groups. Specifically, this group had higher symbolic and AIG motivations for Mobile TV use than did the non- and dis-user groups. The Mobile TV user and potential user groups also had higher entertainment content interest than did the dis-user group. The study also investigated how demographic attributes, age identification, and perceived motivations of uses and gratifications contributed to genre choice of Mobile TV viewing. Both high (user and potential user groups) and low (non- and dis-user groups) Mobile TV usage intention groups were likely to have similar motives for using genre repertoire of Mobile TV contents. However, the findings indicated that demographic attributes, age identification, and individual needs for Mobile TV viewing between the two groups varied with content interest in specific programming. Significant predictors and their implications in the hierarchical regression models testing content adoption interest in viewing Mobile TV genres were discussed in the study."

Who or what can have agency? As a response to the crisis of agency in media, this study is an exploration of agency as traced through a quick history of sociology. We begin with Althusser, however, it could be argued that there are proto-forms of agency in the work of Marx and Durkheim, as well as that of Gabriel Tarde (1888). Althussers notions of structure and agency also greatly influenced Bourdieus concept of the habitus. Later, Foucault described subjectivity in a tug-of-war with ubiquitous power. Thus, I trace the progress of agency as it emerges in relation to Bourdieus habitus and Foucaults discourse. Judith Butlers theory of performativity is also conceived as a radical form of agency. Extending the dislocation of agency and identity further, however, I explore the role of uncommodifiable anger (Artaud), and the breakdown of the individual voice in the work of Kierkegaardthe emergence of a demonic writing machine (Hodge, 2000)in destroying identity. This broaches the question of text as agent divorced from identity. Can this question be reconciled with reference to the agency of objects in Actor-Network Theory (Latour, 2005)companies, computer networks and texts themselves? How does Actor Network Theory relate to Roses (2007) technologies of government? How does the agency of non-humans compare to that of the cyborg (Haraway, 1989)? The discussion comes full circle to Tarde and the fact that he considered the problem of unshackled agency a century ago."

(Attribute) Agenda Setting Studies","This study examines the issues and attribute agendas built by candidate Web sites and newspapers during the 2008 Democratic presidential campaign. The results show that there were no obvious gender and racial differences among the candidates Web sites agendas. In the traditional medias agendas, the female and minority candidates were treated more equally than before, although some gender and racial stereotypes still existed in the newspaper coverage. The intermedia agenda-setting between the candidates Web sites and the newspaper was also investigated in this study. Although the agenda-setting impact of the newspaper on the candidates Web sites was identified, the Web site campaigning also showed a significant intermedia agenda-setting impact on the newspaper in certain periods for certain candidate, especially when the candidates agendas were consistent and stable."

By examining how media and public agendas interact through Internet feedback opportunities over a two-week period, this paper looks at the gap in knowledge about online agenda setting after media agendas are built but before long-term agenda-setting effects take hold.

Results indicate that media demonstrated a powerful and immediate influence on the public from day to day. On a consistent daily basis, stories presented as important in both the print and online editions of the paper corresponded with stories on which web site users offered the most comments. Yet the dynamic between media and public agendas yielded more complicated and less consistent results over time. These findings provide a preliminary step toward a better understanding of how media and public agendas develop and interact online."

Callers phone in to talk about their personal and social problems, and receive advice from the host and a resident psychologist on the program. In this paper, I examine what happens when the advice giving is opened up to other listeners who call in or text the live-to-air program with views and advice. I compare the framework of advice giving with the activity of advising in other contexts, including other forms of mediated advice giving, and argue that the format of advice in this sequence of the program has a specificity which a) differentiates it from other contexts of advice giving and b) is produced by the alignments and participant roles which constitute a community of listeners, and c) is based on the pragmatics of solidarity and proximity rather than institutional asymmetry and distance."

This study sets out to fill this gap by examining the extent to which Chinese ENGOs use ICT, especially the Internet, to develop environmental campaigns and activities for social changes and the exploratory construction of a nascent civil society in China. Based on first-hand information gained from one-on-one in-depth interviews with 19 environmental NGOs conducted during her field research in Beijing ,China 2007, the author studied and illustrated the specific conditions under which Chinese ENGOs employ the Internet to engage in web-based environmental collective actions. Specifically, this study developed a analytical typology of ICT for environmental movement to answer the questions of: 1) How much does the Internet enhance the capacity of Chinese ENGOs to act on mobilization, policy change, and other environmental and social changes? 2) Under which conditions does the use of Internet by Chinese ENGOs enhance the chance of mobilization, policy change, and other social changes? In addition, this study provides empirical evidence about how the effects of ICT on environmental and social changes in China is socially constructed at the individual (NGO founder), organizational (NGO), and societal (transformative China) levels."

Common beliefs have it that an unhappy relationship is often identified as an unhealthy relationship, referring to its dysfunctional character. The question is whether an unhappy relationship literally can be detrimental for ones health? The present study looked for scientific evidence of this belief. Four hypotheses were tested in a five-wave longitudinal dataset. Findings showed that trust in ones romantic partner is positively related to physical health  participants showed less problematic health symptoms when they have more trust in their partner. Furthermore, fear and depression, both severe threats to physical health in terms of cardiovascular diseases and mortality, fully mediate the effect of trust on health. Finally, results of residual lagged analyses indicated causality, that is, earlier levels of trust predict later anxiety and depression, which in turn predict changes over time in physical health."

The study surveyed 16 affiliated scholars and all of the 13 students enrolled in the certificate program.

Although there was an overall positive attitude toward interdisciplinary programs from both the affiliated scholars and students perspectives, challenges still remain in administering the IHC program. From the faculty perspective, some affiliated scholars noted a perception of multiple barriers including lack of both administrative support and official rewards for faculty participation. Students expressed frustration over registration and conflicting schedules.

In addressing the pedagogical aspects of the IHC, the scholars administer teaching strategies that are unique to the IHC program such as a semester-long project creating a message strategy for a real client and the colloquia and online discussion forums that foster communication among faculty and students. In selecting specific courses for the certificate program, the faculty selected a variety of offerings from different disciplines that would expose students to the varied aspects of health communication.

Students overall were more positive toward certification than the affiliated scholars. Students seem to have an expectation that the certificate will translate into better job opportunities.

This study was a first step in the assessment of one interdisciplinary program. Our small sample size prevented us from making greater generalizations. However, this template provides a roadmap for continued assessment of this and other programs."

It argues that mixis interface imagines the boundary of the social network of an average Japanese person, which in effect sets a criteria for what types of people can fit in in the Japanese society. It also demonstrates that the interface does not simply embody preexisting notions about Japaneseness and politics of inclusion and exclusion prevalent in Japanese society. Rather, there is a neighborhood of relations residing in and around the interface. Thus, the way mixis interface draws a boundary around Japan differs from the ways in which traditional modes of boundary making do so. Additionally, this paper examines how this imagined boundary affects members of different racial, ethnic and cultural minorities living in Japan and discusses implications of the findings in relation to future directions in internet studies and SNS research."

Drawing on an integrated approach to identity and theories of organizational identification and charismatic leadership, the author proposes that the identities of values-led business organizations are strongly linked to identification with the charismatic organizational founder. Furthermore, the author suggests that all those who identify with the values-led organization need not be formal organizational members. Findings reveal that even after her death, Anita Roddick continues to personify The Body Shop identity, resulting in followers perceiving their identities as being intertwined with that of Anita Roddick and The Body Shop. The discursive construction of Roddick as the heart and lifeblood of The Body Shop by corporate management is central in understanding the discursive practices in organizational identification."

It begins with a general description of brown and its political and cultural symbolism. This is followed by a discussion of popular representations of brown bodies by focusing on several shows dealing with brown immigrants, including (but not limited to) Alien in America in the United States and Little Mosque on the Prairie in Canada. The paper argues that the very creation of shows such as these speak to a re-introduction of brown bodies, as alien and awkward, to the North American landscape, which allows brown to be reconstructed as a recent immigrant phenomenon, which effectively wipes out their long history in the Americas. This research contends that the ensuing misunderstandings and cultural differences that are the staple of these shows contribute to the formulaic, Huntingtonian clash of civilizations discourse, that pervades North American political culture and popular understandings of racial and ethnic difference."

AJE is neither dominated by geopolitical nor commercial interests, and is the first of its kind to have the resources, mandate and journalistic capacity to reach out to typically ignored audiences throughout the world. This study argues that AJEs model of journalism offers an alternative to todays mode of news journalism that continues to encourage stereotypical attitudes toward cultural others. Not only has AJEs programming represented a fresh break from the traditional news agenda, but audiences around the world found AJE to work towards a conciliatory function, based on a typology of a conciliatory media developed here. These findings point to the possibility of a global news broadcaster that can bring diverse audiences together and encourage dialogue, empathy, responsibility and reconciliation."

These moments provide a national framework for a discourse in which ""blackness"" and ""mixedness"" make troubled encounters with each other. Since these two categories offers the possibility of critically engaging mainstream representations of black and mixed racial identities, I turn to them here to consider the following questions: If ""1997"" indicates a rift between conventional black community and emergent multiracialism, then what might this divide (within the ""family"") tell us? How might a new ""kinship"" between ""blackness"" and ""mixedness"" lead us away from the conflating binds of essentialist community, and toward a partnership in cultural production, social justice, a mutual future? I argue that the crisis within black/mixed racial ""family"" must attend to what, exactly, gets posited as an antithesis to the familial narrative."
2009-0061,A Lost Promise: The Lack of Interoperability for Open Standard Document Formats,"Promoting Open Competition in Networked-Based Content, Applications and Services",,,,Paper,A Lost Promise: The Lack of Interoperability for Open Standard Document Formats,"Promoting Open Competition in Networked-Based Content, Applications and Services","Open standards are widely considered to have significant economic and technological benefits. This has led many governments to mandate open standards for document formats. Document formats are how a computer stores memos or spreadsheets. Governments are moving away from Microsofts proprietary DOC format to open standard document formats, such as the OpenDocument Format (ODF) and Office Open XML (OOXML). The belief is that by shifting to open standards, governments will benefit from choice, competition, and the ability to seamlessly substitute different vendor implementations.
This paper examines whether open standards themselves can bring the promised benefits. The study examines interoperability for three document formats: ODF, OOXML, and DOC. The research assesses interoperability among different software implementations of each document formats. A set of test documents is used to evaluate the performance of other alternative implementations.
The results show there are issues with interoperability. The best implementations may result in formatting problems, while the worst implementations actually lose information found in pictures, footnotes, comments, tracking changes, and tables. Our findings include specific scores for each implementation. There was considerable variation among how well each implementation performed. For ODF, the raw scores ranged from 151 to 48.
The results question the assumption that open standards guarantee interoperability and choice. The interoperability issues are troubling and suggest the need for improved interoperability testing for document formats. Without interoperability, governments will be locked-in into the dominant implementations for either standard. This result has implications for governments setting open standard policies."

Based on a survey of college students, gender, age, and personal innovativeness are not unique predictors of peoples adoption of online platforms, while perceived utility of online platforms is a significant indicator. The most popular programs people watch online are comedies and dramas. Online video platforms dont seem to be a threat to the following media platformsnewspapers, magazines, music, or radio. However, they have a significant influence on peoples TV viewing habits. More than half of the respondents said online video platforms are substitute to television to some extent. Results from this study shows that a sizable group of audience is migrating to the Internet. This may a warning sign for broadcast networks whose main profit comes from television advertising revenues. Broadcasters need to incorporate alternative platforms into their programming distribution and find innovative ways to monetize these online platforms."
2009-0063,A Mass Communication Perspective on Technology,Keyword: Technology (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,A Mass Communication Perspective on Technology,Keyword: Technology (Cross Unit),"All academic writers on mass communication have agreed that technology applied to communication makes possible the phenomenon called mass communication. Textbooks typically identify such technologies as machines (called mass media) that are used by complex organizations for the large-scale production and reproduction of messages in one form or another. Because of its emphasis on technologys large-scale production and audience reach, this perspective on technology has led some to actually view mass media and mass communication as concepts with declining relevance in the twenty-first century. Another view, though, is that mass media technologies are social processes that guide the creation and use of devices (some of which are machines) by complexes of organizations (industries) in the service of producing, distributing, and exhibiting messages. This redefinition has major implications for the utility of mass communication as a concept in the contemporary world."
2009-0064,Amateur Images in the Professional News Stream,Top Papers in Visual Communication Studies,,,,Paper,Amateur Images in the Professional News Stream,Top Papers in Visual Communication Studies,"This paper offers an international perspective on professional television news's use of amateur footage in the coverage of high-profile events that have global reach. We make a case study of the Benazir Bhutto assassination and compare select U.S. and Norwegian television news sources. Established news channels use amateur recordings of Bhutto's death for rhetorical and narrative purposes that in turn have professional and competitive gains. Our analysis focuses on the textual strategies employed by these professional news makers to incorporate the amateur footage in their news stream. From our findings, we develop a theory of the amateur news gatherer as a paradoxical figure in the contemporary digital media sphere-a figure whose vexed identity challenges claims of the potential democratizing value of new digital technologies."
2009-0065,Ambivalent Messages in Teen Magazines: An Over Time Content-Analytic Comparison,Adolescents and Sexual Media Content,,,,Paper,Ambivalent Messages in Teen Magazines: An Over Time Content-Analytic Comparison,Adolescents and Sexual Media Content,"Several earlier content analyses have focused on the concept of sexual ambivalence  that is, messages about sex and sexuality that are in direct contradiction with each other. However, no study to date has investigated a more encompassing notion of sexual ambivalence through relationship ambivalence and gender role ambivalence. Moreover, no study has considered changes over time. Drawing on issues of Seventeen magazine from 1997 and 2007, this study offers an over time content-analytic comparison of sexual, relationship, and gender role ambivalence. Sexual ambivalence occurred in both 1997 and 2007 with respect to the type of sex (casual vs. committed sex) indicator. Relationship ambivalence was present for the relationship consequences (positive vs. negative emotional, physical, and health consequences) indicator in 1997 and 2007. Gender role ambivalence did not occur in 1997, but emerged in 2007 for the type of clothing (sexy vs. non-sexy clothing) indicator."

I will discuss the representations of Iran and Iranians in American pop culture and mass media and their evolution from the Islamic revolution of 1978, through the hostage crisis, to the current war on terror and cold war on nuclear power."
2009-0068,"American Strategic Communication in Iraq: the ""Rapid Reaction Media Team""","War, Risk, and Biopolitics",,,,Paper,"American Strategic Communication in Iraq: the ""Rapid Reaction Media Team""","War, Risk, and Biopolitics","The purpose of this paper is to interpret an American military media strategy designed for the Iraq war from a perspective drawing on recent theoretical discussions of space and time. The material consists of a short white paper that was declassified under the Freedom of Information Act and published by the NSA in 2007. It outlines a Rapid Reaction Media Team which was tasked with designing and implementing the US-led media system at the onset of war in March 2003. Despite aiming to create a balanced and fair public service television network equivalent to the BBC or PBS, the $100 million budget was derived from the $87.5 billion military budget, with the Department of Defense overseeing implementation. Hence there was a fundamental contradiction between the stated intentions of the network as a provider of balanced news and its broader position within US military objectives. The RRMT plan reveals a series of strategies, inherent conflicts, and assumptions which can be seen to enact forms of structural and symbolic violence complimentary to that of the military. By this, I mean that it sheds light on sophisticated strategies for the transposition of military force to the discursive sphere; for the exertion of violence by other means in US attempts to manage perceptions of the war. In a fundamental sense, the RRMT strategy uses media as an extension of warfare, and this paper will look at how actual violence was transferred from the military battlefield to the discursive."

Numbering about fifty million, most of these people live near a larger town or even within an hour of a major city, but many also live in far more remote regions with limited road access and much less access to air transportation.The telecommunications topography of the United States has never been kind to rural regions. While residents of major population centers are more often than not served by one of the dominant phone companies, such as AT&T or Verizon, in the more rural and remote regions of the country, people have long relied on local independent or cooperative phone companies for their basic service.This presentation reviews the history of rural access and summarizes some of the economic factors that make improved telecommunications in rural regions necessary. Data regarding the contemporary status of broadband services and potential benefits in rural areas are addressed. Finally, the presentation concludes that reviving rural regions through improved telecommunications services means reconceptualizing
and reprioritizing communities and their abilities to determine their communication environmentsin short, it involves reformulating the idea of universal service in a way that goes beyond an implicit social contract."

Both dichotomous forced-choice measures and continuous measures were meta-analyzed and many study characteristics were examined as potential moderators. The evolutionary hypothesis received mixed support as the full cross-over effect was usually only obtained in U.S. student samples. The homosexual samples were largely consistent with the double-shot hypothesis."
2009-0071,A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Public Education Campaigns on the Promotion of Organ Donation,Communication and Organ Donation,,,,Paper,A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Public Education Campaigns on the Promotion of Organ Donation,Communication and Organ Donation,"The current study provides a quantitative review of public education campaigns designed to promote organ donation. To estimate the effects of public education campaigns on the promotion of organ donation, a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. Findings across 23 campaigns indicate the overall effect of public education campaigns in organ donation was a 5% increase in study outcomes compared to a baseline or control group. Considering that the effect of public education campaigns may differ across characteristics of campaigns, several moderators including target group, amount of campaign exposure, type of intervention, and publication bias were tested. Although there was overlap in 95% confidence intervals, campaigns that included an interpersonal communication outreach component were more effective than those that relied exclusively on mass media communication channels. The findings offer insight that interpersonal communication is an effective method to reach and influence individuals decision-making on organ and tissue donation, consistent with research on OTD campaigns."

Comparison of number of publications of these authors to the number of citations to these authors does indicate a significant correlation, r = -.232, p < .05, but not a simple correspondence. Consideration of communication and noncommunication journal publications as well as book citations and accounting for the length of career provides a set of alternative considerations to consider the impact, importance and influence of communication scholars."

Results gathered from questionnaire responses of women who had recently undergone treatment for breast cancer (N = 140) indicated that the association between topic avoidance and relationship satisfaction was moderated by patients own reasons for avoidance and by perceptions of partners reasons for avoidance. The findings of this study contribute to recent scholarship suggesting the importance of considering the motivations for and interpretations of topic avoidance in order to better understand how patterns of topic avoidance predict relational well-being."

This paper presents the results of a quantitative study of the debate over copyright and DRM in four time periods between 1989 and 2006. On balance, congressional hearings were more sympathetic to those calling for stronger copyright-based regulation of DRM systems, but this advantage dissolved over time, completely disappearing in the 2003-2006 period. Possible explanations are discussed, including the rise to power of sympathetic congressional leadership and the increasing presence of nonprofit groups."

It delivers the perfect surrounding for a case study  because all the findings could be discussed from a common standpoint: the societies in Europe  the different they are , from orientation of politics, distribution of political power, or economic growth still are reflecting a quite similar base, and could, with that, be compared in a way better than any other region of the globe. This contribution will analyze foreign correspondents self-conception and labour conditions by using a survey with questionnaire plus content analysis.
The perhaps most interesting hypotheses of the paper is  especially regarding the current crisis on the financial markets  the following: The foreign correspondents of European media specializing in business journalism have a special professional self-conception which is composed of various dimensions. The findings on this hypotheses could directly lead to an interesting interpretation of the reaction of European mass media in the second half of 2008. With that, this paper seems to be fairly relevant to near oneself to an intellectual of understanding role-consciousness of business reporters working in foreign countries. From seven alternatives the foreign correspondents questioned in Germany see themselves as arrangers and explainers with a neutral fact orientated habit. That might be the most surprising finding of this research  and should (in the opinion of the authors)  lead to further research."

In Experiment 1, among individuals who listed emotions experienced by story victims, those exposed to unconventional font headlines reported more intense negative emotions and elevated estimates of problem seriousness and risk than do those exposed to convention headlines. No significant font effects were found among those not listing emotions. In Experiment 2, individuals who made rationally-oriented probative value judgments of the stories after reading them manifested lower estimates of seriousness and risk than those not making the judgments; however, the font manipulation yielded no significant effects. Disruption of processing fluency may induce individuals to be more attentive to story details, but not necessarily induce more rational calculation when making story judgments, thus suggesting the possibility of both analytic intuition and intuitive rationality."

Since the early years of television the United States were the most important exporter of TV series, TV serials and game shows. But nowadays times have changed. Admittedly they are still the leading nation in selling TV fiction all over the world, but since the deregulation of the TV market in Western Europe in 1990s Great Britain and the Netherlands are the leading exporters of non-fictional formats like reality shows, Australia sells its soap operas all over the world, and Latin American countries are important exporters of telenovelas. In the beginning of the twenty-first century the Colombian telenovela Yo soy Betty, la fea made its way around the world. Several countries bought the rights to produce a local adaptation of the format. For example ABC produced Ugly Betty in the United States, the German channel Sat.1 produced Verliebt in Berlin, and there is a Russian adaptation Ne Rodis Krasivoy. Other countries with local adaptations of this telenovelas are Belgium, Croatia, Greece, India, Israel, Mexico and Spain. This paper compares several local adaptations of the telenovela: the Columbian original and the adaptations in Germany, Russia, Spain and the USA. It looks at the stylistic and aesthetic proximities and differences of the adaptations, the different production contexts and focus on the textual and cultural conditions of the international success."

In contrast to this view of companies being dominated only by the idea of improving returns for shareholders, the concept of stakeholding advocates a democratic approach to business which values relationships with a range of stakeholders. Described variously as being based on Keynesian economics (Hutton 1996), communitarianism (rights matched by responsibilities) (Burkitt and Ashton 1996) and the Kantian notion of duty (as opposed to utilitarianism) (Etzioni 1988 in Burkitt and Ashton 1996), in political terms, stakeholder theory is premised on the interelation of state, society and the economy as opposed to a free market approach .
Using a case study on The Bank of Scotland, this paper examines ways in which the Bank changed its CSR policy over the last 8 years, when, in light of criticism of poor social performance, instead of developing more committed approaches to CSR, the Bank withdrew from important elements of the principle with no apparently negative consequences.
If CSR is posited around a triple bottom line (comprising social, environmental and economic performance), the Banks statements on its CSR policy seemed to demonstrate a withdrawal from anything more than a basic legal adherence to social performance. References to trust, corporate citizenship and strengthening local communities were removed from its policy statements which now focus mainly on economic impacts.
This seems to mirror consumer research which posits that 'The elements of corporate reputation that seem to matter most to consumers in practice are perceptions of fairness toward consumers, and perceptions of corporate success and leadership, rather than public responsibility (Page and Fearn 2005:306). In light of the current credit crunch however, the paper explores whether this attitude behviour gap will diminish , and whether the role of public relations will be to reinvigorate corporate social responsibility policies underpinned by a real adherence to stakeholder theory and the tenets of communitarianism."

This ensuing effort is described through an analysis of the founding documents  draft laws, Knesset floor and committee debates, and the final legislative form  that led to the creation of a minimum quota for the broadcasting of Israeli songs on Israeli public and commercial radio stations and the establishment of a government-licensed Israeli and Mediterranean music channel over cable and satellite television. The narrative that rises from the debate that takes place annually as part of the celebration of Israeli Song Week in the Knesset about the Israeli song helps illustrate the underlying ideological assumptions of this effort. The study identifies the overriding elements of the hegemonic Israeli narrative in these documents and debates and sets them in context of other Israeli cultural policies and in particular those pertaining to broadcasting. Taking into account how expressive culture (i.e. music) and the global music industry impact the shaping of domestic cultural policies, the study contextualizes Israeli cultural policies as they pertain to Israeli music and provides a theoretical framework to analyze their development and underpinnings."

She is the bi-species and, not incidentally, multiracial child of the cyborg Athena (Korean American actress Grace Park) and the human Helo (Euro-American actor Tahmoh Penikett). While critics of the show have noted how BSG can be read as a commentary on the Iraq War, Hera echoes images from the earlier conflicts of the Korean and Vietnam war and the controversies over the Eurasian children of servicemen. Envisioning those children, many of whom were transnational adoptees, became a way for the U.S. to imagine its place in the wake of its conflicts in Asia. In similar ways, the character of Hera offers a way to understand how the images of multiracial families and the transnational adoption narratives that currently flood the media reflect U.S. global aspirations."

This study contributes to theory driven research in strategic communications by using an experimental design to test the influence of six distinct corporate social responsibility initiatives, as identified by Kotler and Lee (2005), the beliefs, attitudes and behavioral intentions of message receivers, using Fishbein and Ajzens (1975, 2005) theory of reasoned action as a theoretical framework. This study extends understanding of the Dual Credibility Model by examining the influence of corporate credibility as a belief set and mediator between organizations and their target publics. This study is uniquely focused on developing a better understanding of how corporate social responsibility initiatives influence corporate credibility and corporate social responsibility beliefs.
Findings do not indicate significant differences among corporate social responsibility initiatives. Only significant differences between using and not using an initiative were found. CSR initiatives do influence belief sets, specifically CSR beliefs. The corporate credibility/ trust belief set showed the strongest positive influence on attitude toward the advertisement and attitude toward the organization. Attitude towards the organization demonstrated a significant influence on behavioral intention toward the organization. These results support the theory of reasoned action. Exploratory research found that corporate credibility/trust and corporate credibility/expertise directly and significantly influenced behavioral intention toward the organization, suggesting an extension of the theory within the context of corporate credibility."
2009-0083,An Exploration of the Relationship Between Patient Participation and Outcomes of Quality of Care,Healthcare Provider and Patient Communication,,,,Paper,An Exploration of the Relationship Between Patient Participation and Outcomes of Quality of Care,Healthcare Provider and Patient Communication,"In this paper we test the importance of patient participation in health care by invoking Streets Linguistic Model of Patient Participation in Care (LMOPPC: 2001). We sought to determine whether greater patient participation predicted patients perceptions of better quality of care, as measured by patient satisfaction with care and patients perception of information adequacy. In addition, the paper aimed to determine which components of patient participation were important in terms of outcomes. We also examined other understudied aspects of Streets model that influence patient participation: patient perception of right to participate; doctor-patient familiarity; and patient anxiety. First, we proposed that compared to patients who report low levels of right to participate, patients who report high levels of right to participate will report higher levels of participation. Second, we predicted that compared to patients who report low levels of familiarity, patients who report high levels of familiarity will report higher levels of participation. Finally, we proposed that compared to patients who report low levels of anxiety, patients who report high levels of anxiety will report higher levels of participation. Sixty-six patients attending a Brisbane (Australia) medical practice participated. Results provided partial support for Streets (2001) LMOPPC model. Patient participation was found to significantly predict patient satisfaction and perception of information adequacy. Additionally, perception of right to participation significantly predicted patient participation. Results are discussed in terms of potential future research, and implications for theory and practice in the field of health communication."

2009-0085,An Historical Perspective on Whiteness in U.S. Broadcasting,Discourses of Diversity in Media Production,,,,Paper,An Historical Perspective on Whiteness in U.S. Broadcasting,Discourses of Diversity in Media Production,"Although the rise of white, middle-class domestic comedies is typically associated with fifties television and programs like Father Knows Best, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, and Leave it to Beaver, these program conventions were actually rooted in the institutional, political and cultural contexts of thirties radio. Through discourse analysis of a popular primetime serial, One Mans Family, this paper shows how whiteness  defined as the cultural performance of white racial subjectivity  was created over the radio medium. It examines changes in the radio industry that promoted whiteness in U.S. broadcast programming, and argues that these changes must be contextualized within larger Depression-era efforts to rejuvenate and institutionalize white privilege. Analysis shows radio whiteness to be a complex discourse, constructed through the interaction of sound and narrative and embodied in the vocal performances of gendered identity. In the text of One Mans Family, whiteness provided a means of disciplining female independence and asserting male prerogatives. In Richard Dyers terms, whiteness took on substance in One Mans Family in two main ways: in contrast to a racialized American Indian other, and through the representation of physical isolation, alienation, or death. Although shown to be isolating and debilitating, whiteness was still held up as a dominant and desirable ideal."

Through the analysis of the use of verbal and visual language in the documentary texts, participated observation, and in-depth interview of producers, this study examines the production of documentary Chinatown in its social-historical contexts. it examines the strategic use of terms and concepts in the documentary to convey politically neutral meanings about nation and state. The concept of nation is used as cultural roots and family tie, and its connection to the state has been removed. The production of Chinatown is a negotiation between different institutions, and Phoenix TV has maintained a balance between the political requirements and market in China. It chose ordinary people as protagonists and concentrated on their daily activities and conversations. Through the documentary production, overseas Chinese as documentary protagonists were connected with the viewers in China, constructing an imagined global Chinese community. This kind of national consciousness is not based on blatant and strong patriotic expressions. Instead, the national identity is represented in everyday expressions of the individual Chinese immigrant in the documentary."
2009-0087,Animation and Involuntary Covert Attention: A Methodological Testing of Automatic Attention Capture vs. Contingency Capture Theories,Keywords in Information Systems: Attention (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,Animation and Involuntary Covert Attention: A Methodological Testing of Automatic Attention Capture vs. Contingency Capture Theories,Keywords in Information Systems: Attention (High Density),"This experimental study examines two species of theories explaining banner animation effects: ""automatic attention capture"" vs. ""contingency capture."" Research based on the automatic attention capture theory suggests that motion detection is fundamentally natural and conducted involuntarily during the early stages of visual information processing (e.g., Lang, Borse, Wise, & David, 2002; Reeves & Nass, 1996). The contingency theory, on the other hand, explains that although motion detection may be automatic and involuntary, attention capture is contingent on attentional control settings, such as motivation and task demands (Folk, Remington, & Johnston, 1992). Researchers employing these theories have been able to produce data patterns consistent with predicted hypotheses, yet little attempts have been made to test the competing theories within the same experimental design. Furthermore, the stimuli used in these studies have widely been different from one another, making it difficult to compare the data for the purpose of theory testing. The present investigation attempts to provide a methodological ground to testing these two competing theories related to animation effects by employing a visual search paradigm. A total of 48 participants will be performing a visual search task in one of the two independent 2 (Target Banner Type) x 4 (Distractor Number) within-subject designs. Search task performance will be measured in reaction time to provide not only a solid, data-driven testing of the theories but also an important implication concerning the finding that attention capture is not always involuntary but contingent on attention control settings induced by task demands."

As the use of political advertisements increases, the effects need to continuously be studied. With priming and framing effects as a theoretical explanation, this study explored how political advertisements can impact an individuals perceptions of unknown candidates source credibility ratings. Results suggest that political advertisements do cause a significant emotional reaction within individuals. No matter the type, positive or negative, each advertisement significantly impacted emotions (averaged across an eight emotions typology). Furthermore, negative advertisements caused more of an emotional reaction, when compared to the positive advertisements. The notion of sponsorship impact received little support in this study. Only viewing negative advertisements at time point one caused a difference in emotional reactions between sponsored and un-sponsored advertisements."
2009-0089,An Integrated Model of Health Disclosure Decision-Making,Predictors and Consequences of Health-Related Disclosures,,,,Paper,An Integrated Model of Health Disclosure Decision-Making,Predictors and Consequences of Health-Related Disclosures,"This paper presents an integrated model of health information sharing, the DD-MM (Disclosure Decision-Making Model), focusing on the decision process prior to revealing/concealing personal health information. The DD-MM proposes evaluation of uncertainty related to information, relationship, and efficacy and describes a possible sequence that can cut across contexts. The model was developed to integrate and organize lines of research, as well as lay a foundation for future examinations. The disclosure process outlined by the DD-MM includes a nuanced selection of disclosure recipients based on relative assessments of identified components. This is conceptualized as a process including both direct and indirect effects (prior to the disclosure enactment). The first part of this process is to assess the diagnosis or information (Propositions 1-5), followed by an evaluation of a potential receiver (Prop. 6-7), and finally exploration of perceived disclosure efficacy (Prop. 8) in predicting willingness to disclose. Interruptions to the most predictable decision patterns are also included (Prop. 9-10), along with potential feedback loops. Propositions are included to allow for testable hypotheses and to examine more complex associations accounting for moderation and interruptions in the general decision-making process."

A total of 348 Korean adolescents participated in a nationwide survey. In the proposed model, through parental instructive mediation, open family communication was found to indirectly increase childrens perceived disparity between televised world and real world reality and increase childrens perceptions on the potential negative effects of television. Open family communication was also found to increase childrens perceived negative effects of television through restrictive mediation. However, parents coviewing mediation did not directly affect both childrens perceived reality and their perceived negative effects of television in the model."

The author proposes an Integrated Personal Health Management system that would provide clinicians, caregivers, and other authorized individuals the ability to access the patients health information, as well as contribute information to various elements within the system. Embedded within the context of patient-centered care, the various elements of the system as well as the potential impact they could have on the quality of care and health outcomes of health care consumers will be described in more detail throughout the paper."
2009-0092,"An Intergroup Perspective on Keywords in Intercultural Communication: Culture, Communication Competence, and the Management of Multiple Identities","Keywords: Culture, Communication Competence, and Intercultural Communication (Cross Unit)",,,,Paper,"An Intergroup Perspective on Keywords in Intercultural Communication: Culture, Communication Competence, and the Management of Multiple Identities","Keywords: Culture, Communication Competence, and Intercultural Communication (Cross Unit)","In considering keywords in intercultural communication, I propose to address and engage a discussion about the joints and disjoints between intergroup communication and intercultural communication with a specific focus on culture, communication competence, and the management of multiple identities in interaction. First, I will distinguish intergroup perspectives on the study of culture, competence, and identity from an intercultural perspective. Second, I will broadly introduce the complications of communication competency when interacting with multiple identity groups. Third, I will suggest ways in which intergroup and intercultural communication scholars can work toward a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities of communication competence within multi-group and multicultural encounters.
The belief that group is part of self and self is part of group is not new; however intergroup and intercultural scholars could place more attention on the multiplicative and shifting nature of our group identities within and across social encounters. This is especially important in contemporary times where many of our day to day interactions involve negotiating cultural and/or group identities and global networking has become an accepted part of scholarship, business, diplomacy, and professional and personal relationships. In short, increased intergroup encounters and technological advancement as a result of globalization has increased the occasions for managing multiple group identities in any given encounter. Formation, management, and maintenance of different social identities require social and communication competence that will vary from group to group and involving a complicated system of cultural and linguistic code switching. Thus, a question of concern for intergroup and intercultural scholars is, how do successful communicators negotiate and manage multiple (often competing) social identities in one interaction?"
2009-0093,Announced Refusal to Answer: A Study of Norms and Accountability in Broadcast Political Interviews,Top Four Papers From the Language & Social Interaction Division,,,,Paper,Announced Refusal to Answer: A Study of Norms and Accountability in Broadcast Political Interviews,Top Four Papers From the Language & Social Interaction Division,"Abstract
This paper investigates announced refusals to answer as a form of dispreferred and challenging responses in broadcast political interviews. A non-answer can be understood as an illegitimate evasion and a transgression of norms. Announced refusals can also bring the question asked into the discourse. The interviewer can be criticized for asking inappropriate questions. The overall aim of the paper is to study how the rightness and wrongness of conduct is dealt with in situations of announced refusals to answer. More specifically the paper focuses on: (1) announced refusals as a particular type of conduct; (2) the orientation to norms and accountability in situations of announced refusals; (3) how the legitimacy of politics and journalism is negotiated in broadcast interviews. The analysis is based on the tradition of Ethnomethodology and CA, focusing on how the participants treat themselves and others as normatively accountable. The study is based on a corpus of data from Swedish election campaigns. The analyses show how different recourses are used in the design of refusals, and how the politicians relate to institutional identities in the production of accounts. The non-answers are mainly designed to be understood as an appropriate distancing action without explicitly complaining about the interviewers conduct. The journalists respond to the implicit questioning of the question by asking a new question. In doing this they close a situation of potential challenge, avoid explicitly talking about the appropriateness of their own conduct, and orient the interaction back to the normative question-answer system."

When the community was not given a specific answer as to Timothy Thomas death, or as to why another young African American man had been shot by the Cincinnati Police, race riots ensued. After the riots ceased a subsequent boycott of downtown Cincinnati by the African American community followed. The boycott called for all to avoid doing absolutely any unnecessary business in the downtown areaimpacting the tourist, entertainment and hospitality industries greatly. The boycott, though no longer powerfully supported, still stands currently, seven years later (Lazare, 2001; Pierre, 2002). Cincinnati, whom in 1993 was proclaimed Americas most livable city by Places Rated Almanac (Savageau & Boyer, 1993), has seen sharp increases in job loss and crime rates, correlating to its ranking as one of the most poverty stricken cities in the U.S. (Country and city databook, 2007; Johnson, 2002; Savageau, 2007). This study analyzes Benoits (1995) theory of image restoration and the tactics of reducing offensiveness that Cincinnati has used for image restoration. Furthermore, due to the racial issues that surround the riot, this study incorporates critical race theoryparticularly differential racializationin order to understand the effectiveness of Cincinnatis image restoration tactics. Finally, this study builds off of image restoration and critical race theory to expose the risk of racial oversight through examining the need for reconciliation in image restoration."
2009-0096,Answering the Talking Snowman: The CNN/YouTube Debates and the Challenge of the Third Voice,News in Election Season,,,,Paper,Answering the Talking Snowman: The CNN/YouTube Debates and the Challenge of the Third Voice,News in Election Season,"Amidst the dozens of debates held in the 2007 and 2008 presidential primary season, two stand out due to their departure from the standard format. In an effort to incorporate non-journalistic voices into these debates, CNN partnered with the Web site YouTube to create a new format in which users were able to upload homemade video questions directed at the candidates. In two live debatesthe Democrats in July 2007 and the Republicans in November 2007CNN posed the video questions to the candidates. With their novel format, the CNN/YouTube debates made possible the inclusion of what we term to be the third voicethe authentic voice of the voteras distinct from the traditionally powerful voices of campaign sources and journalists. This new voice introduces an unprecedented candor to the debate format, but it is constrained in several key ways. CNN, while often turning to normative democratic language to promote the debates, retained its gatekeeping function in selecting and ordering the videos that would be included. As prototypes for the inclusion of citizens into political discourse, these debates signaled the growing anxiety of campaigns seeking to minimize surprises and journalists aiming to protect their relevancy. To discuss the ramifications of this new debate format, we analyze three sites of discourse: promotional materials issued by CNN, YouTube, and Time Warner; the text of the debates; and the widespread discussion of the debates appearing in traditional news sites and new media sites."

However, the relationship between program-induced involvement and recall of in-program advertising has received little consideration. Also the antecedents of program-involvement are largely understudied. The present study aimed to address these gaps. By means of a naturalistic field study during the 2006 FIFA worldcup soccer tournament, we examined the antecedents of program-involvement, as well as its subsequent effects on commercial recall and in-program ad recall. Structural Equation Modeling lend support for an attention spill-over effect. As evidenced by a positive, indirect effect of program-involvement on commercial recall through commercial attention, and a somewhat less strong, albeit significant, positive direct effect on in-program ad recall, ads are better remembered when embedded in a highly involving context. The results further demonstrated that program-involvement is a function of various personal factors."

These two ostensibly related arguments led to an important research question of whether people treat computers as human beings consciously (mindfully) or unconsciously (mindlessly), and several hypotheses were empirically tested in this study. In the current study, two main manipulations of IVs (human-like agent presence and the level of interactivity) will play roles as anthropomorphic cues to trigger participants tendencies to attribute human personalities to computers, and even websites mindlessly. We will focus mainly on 1) whether these manipulated anthropomorphic cues will trigger a mindlessness anthropomorphism tendency and 2) how these cues influence participants judgment of informations credibility. We tested these hypotheses with a 2 (a human like agent presence vs. its absence) X 2 (high vs. low interactivity) between-subjects experiment (N = 93). These findings and their implications are discussed."

Rather than regarding her as a hockey mother, a lipsticked canine, or a movement conservative, it suggests that she is, instead, a sign of nothing at all--that she is the embodiment of suburbanality and mall culture, with all its autotelic measures and norms. I shall draw on my new book Makeover Nation: The United States of Reinvention (2008) to locate the Governor within the US population more broadly and its depthlessness."

From a phenomenological perspective, this work, ahead of the event, can be seen as part of its care structure--the invisible labor that 'gives' the mediated event as the experience that it is for viewers live and in real time. The paper will attend to the combined technological and production care-structures that give the sports event as a seamlessly produced experience for audiences who are not there, at the football or soccer game. The commentators and reporters, camera people, technicians, vision mixers and producers all work together, as the game unfolds, to deliver it moment by moment for viewers. Any staged event requires stage work, and the work of staging it is as much a performance as the performed event."

The primary purpose of this alliance was to provide health communication students an opportunity to observe and assess the health communication skills of third-year nursing students as they practiced their clinical skills and empowered individuals with health-related information in community settings. In addition, the research offers the students a service-learning opportunity as well. Over a three year period, students in an introductory, undergraduate, health communication course were required to observe and assess the health communication skills and effectiveness of third-year nursing students in a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program. The health communication students were randomly paired and assigned times to observe nursing students during a three hour period in each of three different contexts during the semester
From a health communication perspective the student researchers quickly assumed the role of ethnographer, recognized the differences in education and skills training between themselves and the nursing students they observed, and discussed the value of seeing health communication in an applied context versus a traditional classroom setting. From a nursing faculty perspective, observations about a nursing faculty member provided additional support to comments by nursing students regarding that individuals interactions with students. In addition, the nursing course coordinator was able to make course improvements based on health communication student feedback."

This papers focus lies on the implication of the recipients, who participated in the study. The question answered is how encoding (recognition) and storage (cued recall) scores differed in relation to familiarity with the topic political polls, as well as other sociological characteristics of the recipients (major of studies, age, class standing, political participation, and habits of news consumption). Although further research is needed, this paper finally presents findings that suggest to interpreting subheadings in printed text as a structural element that elicits additional resources to process information."

Many of those developments were designed to provide new tools to analyze large collections of text data, extract information, identify patterns and discover hidden relationships. While some may adopt an optimistic view and see in those new methods as more efficient alternatives to the more traditional approaches to text analysis, we believe a more realistic and pragmatic approach combining several methods is warranted. We will illustrates strengths and weaknesses of qualitative analysis, quantitative content analysis and text mining techniques and see how one could profit from combining different approaches and integrates new techniques to achieve more valid and reliable conclusions in less time. We will also stress the importance of constantly mixing qualitative data with quantitative information to get new insights."

The study comprising a review and analysis of the media image of Knesset Member Dalia Itzik who served as acting president of the State of Israel from January to July 2007. Qualitative content analyses were conducted on all the reports and articles (360) published in the Israeli dailies Haaretz, Yedioth Ahronoth and Maariv during this period. Letters to the editor, editorials, and reader talkbacks published in response to these articles were also analyzed.
Like other female politicians in many countries, Itzik suffered particularly critical treatment by means of exclusionary representation strategies  emphasis on aspects irrelevant to the office, such as appearance, on traits that undermine suitability for a leadership role, such as over-emotionality (""a womans heart""), on dependent relationships with men in the political system, and emphasis on her achievements in secondary spheres perceived as feminine (remodeling the residence)."
2009-0106,"A Primer for Communication Researchers on Probing Single-Degree-of-Freedom Interactions in Regression Models, With SPSS and SAS Implementations",The Best of Information Systems,,,,Paper,"A Primer for Communication Researchers on Probing Single-Degree-of-Freedom Interactions in Regression Models, With SPSS and SAS Implementations",The Best of Information Systems,"Communication researchers often hypothesize moderated or 'interactive' effects, in which the effect of an independent variable on an outcome variable depends on the value of a moderator variable. When an interaction is found, it is important to probe the interaction, for hypotheses often predict not just interaction but a specific pattern of effects of the focal independent variable as a function of the moderator. This paper describes the pick-a-point approach for probing interactions and introduces the Johnson-Neyman technique to communication researchers as a little-known but valuable alternative to the more common pick-a-point approach. Examples of both approaches are illustrated and macros for SPSS and SAS are introduced to facilitate the visualizing and probing of interactions in regression models."

Unfortunately, most of the evidence has been anecdotal. In fact, the impact of 9/11 on American popular music is not at all evident. Only four 9/11-themed songs made the charts: two in 2003, two more in 2004, and none in the weeks following the event. Quantitative, computer-assisted content analysis was conducted to see if the traumatic event left any other mark on the musical record. Changes in the emotional orientation of top selling song lyrics were measured. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the emotional tone of the top selling pop songs became significantly more positive. While news, film, and television entertainment programming directly framed and mediated the event, pop music may have provided a welcome escape, a profound distraction."

As a sector within the broader mainstream media landscape, corporate owners of Spanish-language television often view themselves as providing a public service to consistently underserved Spanish-dominant audiences that are often treated as outsiders. Some station managers also believe that Spanish-language television helps Latinos become cultural citizens in a transnational political and economic landscape that demonizes immigrants and chastises individuals who
do not speak English. Yet what is at stake when the mere existence of Spanish-language television is believed to constitute the fulfillment of public service when such outlets are commercial and advertising driven? This paper analyzes the historical, cultural and policy conditions that have transformed commercial Spanish-language broadcasting into a perceived public service for US Latinos, and its future implications of citizenship for this rapidly growing demographic."

At a theoretical level, we view the impact of information processing based on a hybrid model, where both online and memory-based information processing work together in forming political attitudes. At a methodological level, we strive to enhance the validity of research by adopting more realistic decision making tasks (e.g., candidate evaluation and voting choice between multiple candidates) and by presenting more dynamic and complex information, real presidential primary election debate by real candidates. Most importantly, we develop real-time measures of the online tally, strongly grounded in theoretical assumptions of the online information processing model. The novel approach should contribute to advancing our understanding of how citizens use political knowledge for political judgment."

This paper, which draws on Boyms (2001) concepts of conservative restorative nostalgia and creative-progressive reflective nostalgia, offers as a case study a historically-based textual analysis of Soviet film director Andrei Tarkovskys 1966 film Andrei Rublev. The film is a meditation on the life of the 15th-century icon painter Andrei Rublev, a central figure in the history of Russian Orthodoxy. During the 1950s and 1960s, the preferred Soviet narrative appropriated Rublev as a symbol of national unity and resistance to foreigners. Tarkovskys film, through polysemic imagery, undermined this restorative-nostalgic hegemonic narrative and offered an open encoding of Rublevs stormy epoch. The film is an expression of reflective nostalgia not for Rublevs times, but for the integrity of Rublevs challenge to the times."

This anomalous position can be explained by the linguistic diversity of India; the Indian film industry is not a single national film industry but is a mosaic of smaller regional language film industries. Econometric analysis of films produced from 1931 to 2005 shows that market size measured by linguistic population size and economic productivity is significantly positively related to film production. Anecdotal data also supports a market size effect on budget, and extent of exports in accordance with the home market model of media trade."

The Influence of Cultural Psychology on Web-Based Customization,"Offline Culture, Online Behavior",,,,Paper,Are Highly Tailored Messages Always More Effective? The Influence of Cultural Psychology on Web-Based Customization,"Offline Culture, Online Behavior","Web-based customization is widely adopted in a variety of domains today. Current conceptualization of customization is to provide individualized messages to message recipients based on their particular needs or preferences. A growing body of empirical research has shown positive effects for customization, suggesting that customized messages generate stronger memory and a more favorable attitude than non-customized ones because they match message recipients need for unique self identity. However, such findings are centered around the Western notion of self which values individuality  prior studies have tested customization effects with only American people. Given that people from different cultures tend to have different views of self, positive customization effects might not be realized in those cultures that do not encourage unique self identity (e.g., East Asian cultures). To advance conceptual understanding of customization, the current study tested existing conceptual approaches to customization (tailoring, targeting, and generic) with two groups of participants from different cultures (Americans and Chinese). An interaction effect was detected between customization and culture on attitude. Tailored messages generated the most favorable attitude for American participants because these messages matched their preferences for unique self identity. In contrast, targeted messages generated the most favorable attitude for Chinese participants since these messages matched their preferences for self-in-group identity. Such customization effects were mediated by three mediating variables: perceived relevance, perceived involvement, and psychological sense of community. Theoretical and practical implications of study findings were discussed. Future research directions were also addressed."

We conducted a study in which 135 dating couples reported on their relationship once per week for six weeks. Relational uncertainty and interference from partners were positively associated with (a) the intensity of hurt, (b) appraisals of the intentionality of hurt, and (c) the perceived damage to the relationship. Features of the hurtful episode were more proximal predictors of the directness of communication about hurt than characteristics of the relationship. We discuss how our findings shed light on the relational turbulence model and hurtful communication."

Online discussion forums have become a common social environment in which people interact in many ways. The purpose of this study is to examine how women express their emotions regarding female body image in online discussion forums of Doves Campaign for Real Beauty. The findings of conversation analysis showed that the online discussion forum served a form of catharsis in regard to the medias practice of objectifying female bodies. In addition, the role of self-disclosure appeared dominant in interacting with other participants. The participants, who were actively involved in the interaction with others in the online discussion forum, seemed to experience positive psychosocial benefits. The implications of theses findings are discussed in light of emerging social interactions online."

Individuals in a conflict are considered to enact both general and situated roles of themselves and to respond to the other persons role behaviors. Obligation from the general role is proposed to explain individual differences in conflict strategies by constraining individuals embracement of their situated roles and by altering the relative importance of goals. The other persons negative violation of role expectation is proposed to predict relational disruptive conflict behaviors through anger. Participants (N = 265) recalled a past conflict with either a friend or an acquaintance. Their responses to the conflict were assessed. Modeling testing showed that the original model has a moderate but acceptable fit. However, an alternative model with direct links from role enactment to conflict strategies fit data significantly better. Hypotheses testing yielded support for most of the model proposition. Implications of the results, limitations of the study and future directions were discussed."

Specifically, Asian Americans report on the quantity of television they watch, what shows they watch, why they watch, and whether their uses are related to their perceptions of Caucasian vitality. The data reveal that using television for entertainment and escape/relieve boredom were the most important television uses for Asian Americans. At the same time, these two uses were significant predictors of how vital Asian Americans perceived Caucasians. Although selecting and avoiding television for ethnic identity gratifications were not important relative to other gratifications, television selection for identity gratifications was important to Asian Americans who highly identify with their ethnic group."
2009-0117,A Sociocognitive Model of Information Disclosure in Human-Computer Interaction,Online Disclosure and Nondisclosure,,,,Paper,A Sociocognitive Model of Information Disclosure in Human-Computer Interaction,Online Disclosure and Nondisclosure,"This study proposed and tested a social cognitive model of information disclosure in human-computer interaction. Guided by Banduras (1991, 2001) Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), this study conceptualized personalized social cues of Web site interface as computer immediacy (LaRose & Whitten, 2000) and investigated social cognitive processes of the effects of the personalized social cues of immediacy on the likelihood of consumers revealing their personal and health information in the context of a personal health record (PHR) Web site service. The results showed that, regardless of information type (embarrassing vs. descriptive) that can be requested from PHR Web sites, consumers exposure to high level of personalized social cues of immediacy significantly and positively motivated their disclosure intentions even when privacy self-efficacy was controlled. However, the significant direct effect of computer immediacy on the likelihood of information disclosure was not evident in the final path model involving the potential mediators of positive outcome expectations (social trust and customized service benefits) and negative outcome expectations (embarrassment and information abuse). The null relationship between computer immediacy and information disclosure intention suggests that the effect of computer immediacy on disclosure intention is mediated by the social cognitive variables of positive and negative outcome expectations."
2009-0118,A Spiral of Silence for Some: Attitude Certainty and the Expression of Political Minority Opinions,Opinion Perception and Expression,,,,Paper,A Spiral of Silence for Some: Attitude Certainty and the Expression of Political Minority Opinions,Opinion Perception and Expression,"Spiral of silence theory does not assume a simple, bivariate relationship between opinion climate and opinion expression. In fact, the notion of hardcore individuals embraces the idea that there are some people for whom this relationship does not hold true. However, previous research has treated this notion rather as an assumption, not putting it to a direct empirical test. In this paper, we propose that attitude certainty is a key variable to identify the hardcore. Data from three surveys demonstrate that the climate of opinion does only determine opinion expression when individuals hold their attitudes with weak or moderate attitude certainty. For individuals with certain attitudes, no such effect can be found. Thus, there is a spiral of silence only for some, but not for all members of the public."
2009-0119,As Real as Real? Macroeconomic Behavior in a Large-Scale Virtual World,Game Studies: Examining Group Play,,,,Paper,As Real as Real? Macroeconomic Behavior in a Large-Scale Virtual World,Game Studies: Examining Group Play,"This paper proposes an empirical test of whether aggregate economic behavior maps from the real to the virtual. Internal transaction data from a large commercial virtual world  indeed the first such data set provided to outside researchers of virtual worlds  is used to calculate aggregate metrics for production, consumption, and money supply based on real-world definitions. Movements in these metrics over time were then examined for consistency with common theories of macroeconomic change, specifically the Quantity Theory of Money. Results indicated that the virtual world data could indeed be sensibly aggregated using real-world methods, and the resulting statistics were indeed interpretable by macroeconomic theory. Thus, the study suggests that aggregate economic behavior in this large virtual world follows what we would expect to see in the real world. Moreover, a natural experiment was examined for evidence that social behaviors in virtual worlds are strongly a product of the system in which they are placed. A new version of the virtual world, with the same rules, came online during the study. It was found that the new worlds macroeconomic aggregates quickly grew to be nearly exact replicas of those of the existing environment. This is consistent with the Code is Law concept: macroeconomic outcomes in a virtual world may be explained largely by its design structure."

This study investigates the applicability of the theory in communications research in a developing nation, focusing on Kenyas 2007 presidential election. Content analysis and survey were used as instruments of research. Results show substantial media influence on the salient issues in the election as well as on the cognitive and affective matters regarding the candidates for political office. This study cautions that issues like literacy level, press freedom, media reach and affordability need to be considered in the use of the theory in communications enquiry in a developing nation"
2009-0121,Assessing the Value of Virtual Worlds for Postsecondary Instructors,Top Papers in Instructional & Developmental Communication,,,,Paper,Assessing the Value of Virtual Worlds for Postsecondary Instructors,Top Papers in Instructional & Developmental Communication,"The purpose of this study was to assess the value of Second Life among post-secondary instructors with experience using Second Life as an educational tool. Using Everett Rogerss diffusion of innovations theory, survey respondents (N = 162), were divided into three adopter categories: innovators, early adopters and the early majority. Respondents were from 15 countries and 25 academic disciplines, indicating the considerable potential this innovation has to be adopted across many different borders and in many areas of academe. Nearly 94% of respondents said they plan to use Second Life again as an educational tool. However, no significant differences were found in instructors levels of satisfaction with Second Life as an educational tool or their perceived effect on student learning across adopter categories. On the other hand, instructors who conducted class fully in Second Life were significantly more satisfied than those who used Second Life as only a small supplement to a real-world class. Overall, personal interest factors, rather than interpersonal communication factors, most influenced respondents decision to adopt Second Life as an educational tool. In light of these findings, theoretical implications are discussed and practical suggestions are provided."
2009-0122,Associations Between Interactants Personality Traits and Their Feelings of Rapport in Interactions With Virtual Humans,"Offline Selves, Online Personas",,,,Paper,Associations Between Interactants Personality Traits and Their Feelings of Rapport in Interactions With Virtual Humans,"Offline Selves, Online Personas","This study explored associations between the personality traits of human subjects and their feelings of rapport when they interacted with either a virtual agent or a real human. The ani-mated graphical agent, the Responsive agent, responded to real human subjects storytelling behavior, using appropriately timed nonverbal (contingent) feedback. Interactants personal-ity factors of Extroversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness were related to three self-reported components of rapport: Positivity, Attentiveness, and Coordination; and to three behavioral indications of rapport: Meaningful Words, Disfluency, and Prolonged Words. The results revealed that subjects who scored higher on Conscientiousness reported higher rapport when interacting with another human, while subjects who scored higher on Agreeableness reported higher rapport while interacting with a virtual agent. The effects of these personality variables differed significantly across the two experimental groups. The conclusions provide a step toward further development of rapport theory that contributes to enhancing the interactional fidelity of virtual humans."

In theory, these media priming effects may be in line with the primed traits or concepts (assimilation) or the effects may be opposite to the primed traits or concepts (contrast). In an experimental study, participants (N = 81) read a story about a stupid soccer hooligan. This low intelligence prime was assumed to influence subsequent cognitive performance. As expected, participants who read the story without a special processing instruction performed worse in a knowledge test than a control group who read an unrelated text. Cognitive processing (default versus dissimilarity testing) moderated the impact of the hooligan story. The effects of prime intensity, self-activation, and transportation were further considered. Future inquiries with narratives as primes and contrast effects in media effects research are discussed."

This paper reports on studies using quantitative content analysis methods to examine health messages in the mass media from 1985 to 2005 (n=426). We examined article attributes including theories used, topics, media type, and intercoder reliability measures. Our findings show that studies of health-related messages have increased in the last 20 years, and that studies in communication journals are more likely to provide reliability data, while journals with lower impact factors are more likely to publish studies emphasizing theory. We recommend that all publications, regardless of discipline or impact factor, request the inclusion of intercoder reliability data and suggest that authors address theoretical concepts. We also encourage authors to include content analysis, media type and health topic as keywords to facilitate locating articles when conducting literature searches."

Although the program denies any claim of authentic journalism, many viewers rely on The Daily Show for information about American politics. This study compares audience perceptions of The Daily Show with perceptions of hard news to determine how news formats correlate with credibility, viewers reported levels of political activity, and their ability to decode and encode political information. A survey of college students revealed that viewers with a high level of exposure to The Daily Show rated the program as credible or more credible than all other news networks except CNN. Additionally, these viewers had high levels of political comprehension, compared with frequent viewers of other networks, and higher levels of political activity."
2009-0126,A Tale of Two Messengers: User Acceptance of Messengers,Psychology of Technology Adoption,,,,Paper,A Tale of Two Messengers: User Acceptance of Messengers,Psychology of Technology Adoption,"Many studies in user acceptance of information technology focus on areas such as email or word processing without considering alternatives products. This study proposes a model drawn from the technology acceptance model and extended competitive vulnerability model to examine the cognition, affection and conation of competing products. We hypothesize that cognition and affection of one product have negative effects on the competing product, affectively and conatively. This study looks into competing information technology products in the context of two instant messaging technologies. Based on a survey of 300 instant messaging users, the result shows support for the hypotheses. Understanding user cognition and affection for alternative products can help to explain behavior intention. This study contributes to an approach of bringing competition elements into user acceptance research."

Media Consumption in the Digital Age,"Representations of the Audience, and Their Implications, in the Digital Media Age","Digital technologies enable media companies to distribute a vast assortment of titles. What are the consequences for the consumption of those titles? Some commentators, including proponents of the long-tail idea, argue that digital distribution will lead to a shift away from hit content and cause more fragmentation in consumers choices. Drawing on large customer transactions data sets obtained from two online media businesses in the music and video industries, this study examines consumption patterns for obscure and hit products. Among other findings, the results reveal that a large share of consumers, particularly those who consume with a higher frequency and concentrate on a narrow selection of genres, regularly opt for obscure titles in the tail of the distribution that are likely not available through conventional channels. Casting doubt on the democratizing nature of online channels, however, the findings also show that consumers (even those who regularly choose the most unpopular products) spend the largest share of their time and money on hit titles, and generally appreciate those titles more than obscure titles. The study relates those findings to theories in the field of communications, marketing, and economics, and outlines implications for further research on media consumption."

In Experiment 1 (N = 112), message bias was manipulated, message fit controlled for, and the perceived influence on the self, ingroup members, and outgroup members measured. As predicted, people reported first-person perceptions with a pro-ingroup message whereas they reported third-person perceptions with a pro-outgroup messages. Experiment 2 (N = 208) manipulated message fit in addition to message bias. As predicted, when message fit was low compared to when it was high, the effect of self-enhancement on message effect perceptions was depressed. The patterns of the magnitude change of first- and third-person perceptions are consistent with a dual-process explanation and are difficult to reconcile with either a pure self-enhancement explanation or a pure self-categorization explanation."

The results of ranking questions indicated that strategic decision-making capability, problem-solving ability, and communication knowledge and expertise have been recognized as the most important qualities of excellent leadership in public relations. In addition, respondents also believed that on-the-job experiences, individual initiative and desire, and role models are the most valuable sources of leadership skills and development. Almost 50% respondents believed that excellent leaders in public relations are different from leaders in other fields in three ways: having a compelling vision, comprehensively understanding media and information systems, and effectively developing communication strategic plans. Relevant significant themes and implications were also discussed in this paper."
2009-0130,A Third Way for the Public Airwaves: Opportunistic Unlicensed Reuse of Government Spectrum,Communication Law and Policy Poster Session,,,,Paper,A Third Way for the Public Airwaves: Opportunistic Unlicensed Reuse of Government Spectrum,Communication Law and Policy Poster Session,"While many policy analysts have focused on the fate of the 700 MHz auctions, the digital TV transition, and the promise of white space devices, a more vast and under-utilized resource has gone largely unnoticed: government spectrum. The best available data suggests that the majority of federal spectrum capacity is left unused. Strategic reuse of this spectrum could help obviate the need for significant additional reallocation while enabling a wide range of creative new uses and social benefits. Based on what little information is publicly available, it is reasonable to assume that the repurposing of government spectrum would go far in addressing a number of access-related communication problems. Repurposing currently unused U.S. government-controlled spectrum for opportunistic unlicensed use would benefit society by dramatically expanding access to high-speed broadband and increasing the pace of wireless technology innovation. This approach to spectrum policy presents a third way for reform, drawing from both the commons and property rights models of spectrum management."

Participants are instructed to watch half of the clips while they pay close attention and the other half as they watch normally as a manipulation of controlled resource allocation. Clips were a mix of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant as a manipulation of automatic resource allocation. Both pleasant and unpleasant television clips have show to be motivationally relevant and elicit automatic resource allocation. Finally a between-subjects factor manipulated the narrative structure of the clips. For half of the participants, the clips continued a common narrative structure. For the other half, clips were semantically unrelated. Cardiac responding, physiological arousal, and signal detection memory for audio content were assessed."

The major online newspapers agree with not only issue agendas but also the prominence of the stories. The NYTimes.com and washingtonpost.com posted more important stories on the most visible areas of the major sections and publish less important stories on the bottom areas of the sections. This indicates the potentials of major online newspapers to influence other news media. Because news Web sites are major information sources, the convergence of attention and prominence is likely to affect public opinion."

Same-turn repairs appear to implement one or more of nine distinct operations. In this paper, I will briefly introduce those operations, and then examine one of them in greater detail to the degree that time allows  most likely aborting and its sub-varieties: abandoning and escaping. Abandoning is something you can do when you have at least partial control and can let go before coming to possible completion; escaping is something you do when it has you in its control and you do something to stop being in that situation"

The typology takes into consideration both frequency of usage and number of such sites on which a user spends time resulting in four categories of users: dabblers, samplers, devotees and power users. Based on unique data from a survey administered to a diverse group of young Internet users, this article looks at whether there are systematic differences among young people who fall into the above four categories. Findings suggest that intensity of SNS use is not randomly distributed across a group of highly wired users. The implications of the results are a call for more nuanced approaches to SNS use studies."
2009-0135,Audience Evolution and the Future of Ratings Analysis,"Representations of the Audience, and Their Implications, in the Digital Media Age",,,,Paper,Audience Evolution and the Future of Ratings Analysis,"Representations of the Audience, and Their Implications, in the Digital Media Age","This paper assesses the parameters of the field of ratings analysis and considers how changes in the media environment may affect scholarship in this area. This paper first illustrates how changes in the media environment are undermining traditional approaches to ratings analysis. The tremendous fragmentation of the media environment means that traditional exposure-based ratings systems are finding it increasingly difficult to provide sufficiently accurate audience estimates across all available content options. At the same time, the increased interactivity of the contemporary media environment provides new data streams that illuminate aspects of audience behavior other than exposure (e.g., recall, engagement, etc.). These data offer new analytical possibilities for understanding media audiences and are being integrated into transactions that take place between advertisers and content providers, and into their strategic decision-making. Reflecting these dynamics, this paper argues for a definition of ratings analysis that focuses not on a particular aspect of audience behavior (i.e., exposure), but on whatever forms of currency are employed in the audience marketplace. From this standpoint, the new media environment provides new forms of ratings that exist alongside the old, and that can renew and revitalize the field of ratings analysis."

Reviewing existing literature relevant to both public sphere/civil society and media in China, the author found that although a few studied how the mass media and internet facilitate the development and activities of civil society organizations, systematical observation is lacking in how the public have participated in the media for political purposes after media reform, thus transformed the media into social and political power in the rising public sphere(s). Through scrutinizing the changing media landscape of the Chinese media, and discourse analysis of one prominent case in 2007, this article attempts to look at this question from a historical perspective, throwing light on the transformative power of the media on the emergent public spheres in China. The author intends to explain 1) how the participation of Chinese citizens in the media is made possible by the economic and institutional reforms; 2) how the public discussion in the media influenced the political decision-making; 3) how the media nurtured a culture oriented toward freer expression and democratic participation."

A total of 144 respondents completed an online survey. After controlling for personal contact, parasocial attachment to Monk was associated with decreased OCD stereotypes and greater willingness to interact people with OCD. Family members tended to believe that Monk had a more positive influence on others, whereas people who had OCD believed the show had less influence on others. For respondents with OCD, the perceived influence of Monks on their own attitudes was associated with more willingness to seek and disclose mental illness treatment, whereas the perceived influence of the show on others was associated with more willingness to share their own OCD experiences with others."

Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,,,,Paper,Audience Research and Multimodality: What Eye Tracking Reveals about Newspaper Reading,What You See is What You Get? Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,"On closer inspection, the so-called iconic turn in recent media history is a multimodal turn. Media communication has not only been enriched by pictures but has turned from a text-medium into a multi-medium, i.e. into a complex system of different modes like design, colours, pictures, graphics, and typography. Along with the multimodal turn, the linear structure of media communication has become non-linear, which confronts the audience with the problems of selection and attention management. Each recipient has to decide what she wants to receive, in which order and with what intensity. From the perspective of the producer, media communication is no longer only concerned with selecting and creating content. Nowadays, it must also include a compositional and navigational structure for the readers who meet various kinds of content on screens and pages. Thus, audience research under these new conditions cannot not only focus on media effects like knowledge acquisition or attitude change. In addition, it has to take a closer look at the selection processes and attention management. In newspaper research and usability research, this can be done by eye tracking studies.
In our presentation, we will evaluate the eye tracking methodology in regard to its functionality for investigating multimodal communication. We will show that the traditional eye tracking research follows the paradigm of a salience theory since it conceptualises reading as being controlled by salient elements of the design. In contrast, we will argue that an interactional theory, which integrates media features and audience factors, is more appropriate for explaining the reception of multimodal media discourse

In addition to their quantitative growth, there are significant qualitative developments changing the way audiences interact in their daily life with so many audiovisual contents.
This paper looks at some of these changes from a new perspective able to understand and study the multiple interaction processes of interaction between audience members and the ubiquitous screens. First, I discuss the new screens to call attention to the new developments. Secondly, I talk about the old screens to determine what has prevail and the desirable and undesirable traits still present in the old media. Finally but most importantly, I look at what is to come, not as a prediction, but as an exercise in the analysis of the possible scenarios for new models of audience research and the new screens."

A household-level survey of individuals (N = 968) was conducted in four districts in Malawi. Based on responses about perceived risk and efficacy beliefs, four groups were created through cluster analysis: responsive (high risk, strong efficacy); avoidance (high risk, weak efficacy); proactive (low risk, strong efficacy); and indifference (low risk, weak efficacy). Analysis of covariance models were run to determine how, controlling for known predictors, membership in the RPA framework groups would affect knowledge about HIV, HIV testing uptake, and condom use. Findings revealed that membership in the four groups was significantly associated with knowledge about HIV, F(8, 956) = 20.77, p < .001; HIV testing uptake, F(8, 952) = 10.91, p < .001; and condom use, F(8, 885) = 29.59, p < .001. The RPA framework can serve as a theoretically sound audience segmentation technique that informs interventions whether messages should enhance perceptions of risk, beliefs about personal efficacy, or both."

The study addresses the ways in which youngsters use various modalities of SNS (self-description, friend lists) to present themselves. It examines how these self-presentation practices can be associated with the specific nature of self-presentation in adolescence. Special attention is paid to the characteristics youngsters emphasize, the ways in which they express subcultural affiliation, and to how they think about authenticity and misrepresentations on SNS. In the first phase of the study, the content of 220 profiles on two SNS (Noxa and Netlog) was coded and analyzed. The second phase consisted of 33 in-depth interviews with 12 to 18 year olds."

Scepticism about the degree to which they can be trusted to be genuine has resulted in a renewed focus on authenticity in communication among these institutional parties to public discourse. However, being authentic is easier said than done. The notion of authenticity is complex and applied in a wide range of contexts. A review of research in the area shows an analytical split between authenticity as a individual attribute, as an Organizational attribute, and as a source of capital for Organizations in search of a market. This paper reviews theoretical approaches to authenticity as an individual attribute and draws on them to problematise authenticity as an Organizational or product characteristic. It concludes by examining authenticity claims in one particular Organization."

It will test the capacity of the media to remake authority by looking at the case of religious authority. Some have speculated that the persistence of religion in late modernity is related to its integration into modern means of communication. Hjarvard (2008) has introduced the study of mediatization to the question of religion, looking within religious structures and practices for its effects. This paper extends that inquiry by looking to religions expressions in and through culture. The central role of media is implied by Paulo Fariass (2008) definition of religion is that which has the power to enforce the meaning of signs. This places the social power of authority within the cultural realm and at the same time in the domain of the circulation of meanings in the media sphere."

A Look at Uncharted Processes in Media Effects Research,,,,Paper,Away From the Middle Range: The Pros and Cons of Ecological Studies in Mass Communication Research,Above and Beyond? A Look at Uncharted Processes in Media Effects Research,"We have all been trained to distrust ecological studies. The argument that they lead to the ecological fallacy is well known. Ecological studies, however, are common in other fields to study situations in which there is either universal exposure to some agent or little in-group variation in the exposure to the agent. This is very similar to the situation we face in television effects research. Second, ecological studies are particularly useful when the effects we expect are very small at the individual level, but expected to be substantial at the aggregate level. Finally, ecological studies are commonly used to explore causal relationships when experimental data are missing or impossible to obtain. This paper presents the pros and cons of using ecological designs in mass communication research and offers examples from a database of the European Union."

This paper suggests that marketers are coming to understand the logic of a new aging, in which Americans who were born between 1946 and 1964 constitute an increasingly complex assemblage of people who do not necessarily identify with the tried causes and promised rewards of a constructed generation. Media storytellers such as marketers rely on collective memory to communicate connections between their messages and the people who consume them. Collective memory conjures mythic historical images that might or might not have been experienced by Boomers in earlier decades. This work precedes a larger project in which mediated marketing texts and ethnographic data are analyzed to examine the relationship between collective memory and Baby Boomers as consumers. The authors concept of the new aging theorizes that marketing logic relies on a nimble process of performativity to sell a sense of community and authoritativeness."

They neither have the vocabulary, nor the range of voices, required to articulate the singularity, the surprise, and the messiness inherent in real life. Moreover, these are not sellable news items. They lack the shock and awe effect. And they do not possess the comforting certitude of headlines which present viewpoints as facts and  in time  establish them as the truth. Flooded with the self-affirming and prefabricated language of the media, the public discourse trades the possibility of nuanced thinking with simple and sweeping generalization. Presenting Iran as a threat to the world is a case in point. In this paper, I explore the ways in which literature can be used to complicate the picture by honoring the singularities of Iranians and highlighting the complexities of their daily life and culture. Empowered with the creativity of the writer, and the richness of local resources, literary language is open to antagonism and difference as part and parcel of a global kinship. From a social perspective, literature is a multi-agent tool for expression. It therefore does not surrender to central control systems or self-affirming media style repetition."

Yet whatever the reason for these not-since-the-Depression characterizations of the economy, the empirical reality is quite different. This disconnect between reality and rhetoric serves as a point of departure for our study as we explore the inability of the predominant neo-classical model to engage with a globally abstracted economic system. Our analysis follows an autopoietic (Maturana & Varela, 1987) and rhizomatic (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987) conceptualization of assemblages that challenges assumed divisions between culture and economics. Thus, we argue that credits articulation as both a technology of individual mediation and corporate conveyance disrupts a modernist notion of the economic as a distinct element of social life. Our critical and empirical analysis of historical mark-to-market accounting practices and their role in financial crises demonstrates the specific ways these practices affect the temporal and cultural dimensions of debt.

Marginalized folk born between the early sixties (SNCC sit-ins, JFKs election and the March on Washington) and the late seventies (the Bakke decision and the rise of the Right and Ronald Reagan) who view the political system with jaundiced eyes, they came of age in the era of Reaganomics, desegregation and .deindustrialization. The post soul era that produced the buppie and B-Boy, the slacker and the microserf also produced Barack Obama, and this essay will explore how his candidacy, for better and for worse, speaks to and for these constituencies."

This paper suggests that the situation-movement-states categories as identified in Dervins Sense-Making Methodology (SMM) could be understood as a phenomenology of power. I compare the range of situation-movement-states identified in peoples descriptions of their conflict experiences in two collectivities: in Paganism, a dispersed and nodally organized movement which resists high level hierarchical ordering; and in Catholicism, a hierarchical, tightly structured communicating environment."

For early advocates of Visual Education, such as George Kleine and Charles Urban, the anti-fly campaign also offered a timely opportunity to showcase the power of film as an educational technology. As I argue in this paper, early visual educators and social reformers found in the disease-carrying fly both an easy target and a useful motif for advertising larger, more profound social agendas. For those committed to the cause of Visual Education, silent films promised a transformation of U.S. cultural, political, and civic life in strict alignment with popular Progressive ideals. This dream of healthy revolution found expression in the Fly Pest crusade and would deeply inform the Visual Education movement through the 1910s and 1920s."

A growing number of scholars are analyzing urban space through multiple lenses of our field: its impact on public dialogue, intercultural relationships and new communication technologies. This paper explores how the meaning of urbanization has become central to contemporary politics in Los Angeles.
Much recent scholarship argues that cities are becoming more suburban. But this trend seems to be countered in L.A., where many worry the neighborhood of North Hollywood is becoming too ""urban"". Some interpret this anger over increased urbanization as reflecting residents' desire to maintain social isolation. This paper shows how contesting visions of the urban have real consequences for public policy. However, these consequences are often not what those holding the differing visions expect."

Two motivational theories, uses-and-gratifications approach and regulatory focus theory, were integrated to examine the underlying structure of media consumption and the psychological processes that drive media use. A total of 413 young women, including both college students and non-students, were surveyed. Results showed that, compared to prevention motives, promotion motives for reading beauty and fashion magazines exerted greater influence on individuals perceived appearance importance, and intentions for physical, fashion, and cosmetic enhancements."

This paper interrogates the conference theme of Keywords in Communication by focusing on the concepts of construction and representation of beauty in womens magazines as mediated texts. In an extension of previous research in this tradition (e.g. Kilbourne, 1999; Frisby, 2004; Wolf, 1992), this study examines the beauty ideals among black models in terms of skin tone, hair length, and hair type. A content analysis was conducted with a sample of 40 advertisements and 58 models obtained from a sample of six black magazines from the United States and Kenya. The findings suggest that lighter skinned black models, models with straight hair and those with long hair are disproportionately used in black magazine advertisements. The findings of this study research suggest that there needs to be more interpretive research comparing the relative importance of hair length and hair type as a beauty ideal for individuals of African origin."

Abstract:
This study explored how a cohort of Asian Indians who migrated to the U.S. nearly 40 years ago have become acculturated to U.S. by watching American television when they first arrived. The study used two concepts of the integrative communication theory: enculturation, the process of socialization individuals undergo in their native culture; and acculturation, the process in which newcomers acquire some, but not all, aspects of their new host culture (Kim, 2001).
Oral history interviews were conducted with 10 couples who migrated to the U.S. between 1960 and 1972 in the Washington Metro area to understand their media use over the past 40 years.
The study described how these Asian Indians also learned the act of watching television after they arrived in the U.S. as they did not grow up watching television in India. Hence, they became enculturated into American television. While learning to watch television, this cohort also became cultivated into certain genres of American programs like family programming, soap operas and sports. This cohort also watched American television to learn how to act more American, learn how Americans act and think and help them improve their English. As a result, they used American television to acculturate to the U.S. Furthermore, the study created linkage between the uses and gratifications theoretical perspective and the need for acculturation."

Celebrities such as Tiger Woods and Halle Berry were employed to give the public examples of multiracial individuals who had recently (and successfully) arrived. However, these reports rarely mentioned how, two decades earlier, three multiracial entertainers had become pop icons before multiracial terminology became mainstream. This paper will examine how Black-owned and dominant entertainment magazines (Ebony, Jet, People, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone) portrayed 1980s multiracial celebrities. The examination will compare how Prince, Jennifer Beals, and Lisa Bonet were framed by black and mainstream entertainment media, and compare how their racial identities were recognized to the recognition of biracial celebrities who emerged after the multiracial movement and the 2000 Census."

Belligerent broadcasting is a broadcast style that offers as spectacle expressions of anger or impatience, or the exercise of intimidation, against an on-screen interlocutor. Focussing on the performances of Sir Alan Sugar on The Apprentice and the prospective investors on Dragons Den, the paper will analyse the management of on-screen confrontation between interlocutors occupying contrasting positions of power and business credibility. The paper will also look at the amelioration of face-threatening activity in the framing of belligerent talk, and at the representation of conflict talk as a productive force within the broader narrative of the programme. Finally, the paper will assess the relevance of arguments that this broadcasting style might be seen as part of a new incivility in the dominant representation of business culture."

Gender Difference in Visual Cue Use When Initiating Friendship on Facebook,In Your Face-book Cues,"This research investigates how moderating factors and theoretically relevant contextual variables affect impression formation and the willingness to initiate virtual friendship. An experiment examined both the main and interaction effects for visual cues, profile owners gender, and evaluators gender; a 2 (stimulus gender: male and female) × 3 (visual conditions: attractive, unattractive, and no photo) × 2 (evaluators gender: male and female) between subjects model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed. A three-way interaction between gender and appearance was revealed. The results indicated that both male and female subjects were more willing to initiate friendships with opposite-sex profile owners with attractive photos. Subjects also displayed comparatively higher willingness to make friends with the profile owners who did not include visual cues than with those who revealed an unattractive photo. The hyperpersonal model was supported and extended to address gender attributes."

The nation as an organisational principle, however, still seems to be in vital health. It has lately been moving on from the political sphere and is fast becoming a more prosperous concept in the arena of marketing in the world economy. In this article we look at two recently successful projects of nation branding: Estonia and India. Both these countries have since the last decade made considerable efforts to establish themselves in the global economy with the help of refashioned national images. On the bases of material from two branding campaigns we argue that in the era of neo-liberalism, the nation is becoming something quite different from the imagined community of bygone days. Thus, nation branding is a historically specific form of producing images of the nation. We discuss in particular three dimensions that distinguish nation branding from nationalism: the intended audience, the sphere of production and the aspect of temporality."

This is the central question of our paper, in which the relation between media and politics is placed in a longitudinal and comparative perspective. We start off from the post war era of segmented pluralism that characterized most European countries. Journalists and politicians interacted along partisan lines and identified with the same ideological or religious group. Over the years this form of political parallelism has almost gone astray, with journalists taking a more independent position towards politics and political parties. However, the relation has not become more distant as politicians and journalists engage in daily interactions over the content of the news. In this paper we will look at what this negotiation process looks like by comparing the frequency and formality of contacts between journalists and politicians in five European countries. According to the classic work of Hallin & Mancini on political media systems (2004), the five countries in this study (Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Denmark) all belong to the democratic corporatist type. We will compare the interaction process journalists and politicians in these counties following the experimental similar system design method. The data were gathered via a survey among Members of Parliament and political journalists in the five countries. First results indicate that, although political parallelism disappeared to the same extent, the interaction process is quit different in these similar countries."

In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with 12 women in Pune city, India, in the local language Marathi. Even though the author speaks the language fluently, it is not her mother tongue. Also, because ancient religious Hindu texts were written in yet another language, Sanskrit, participants answers were interspersed with chants and terminology from this language which the author did not understand completely. Effectively therefore, interviews were done in multiple languages including some English. There were a number of syntactical and linguistic challenges in conducting the interviews which also made transcriptions especially difficult. In this roundtable discussion, the author presents the dilemmas and challenges, including issues of representation and positionality that she faced in conducting research in her own country and in communicating them to the English speaking audiences."

Research about these media has grown dramatically, especially in the past few years, but, there have been few reviews of this research and none of the most recent scholarship. This paper reviews scholarship on online news production published since 2000. It examines research on five key topics: historical context and market environment, the process of innovation, alterations in journalistic practices, challenges to established professional dynamics, and the role of user-generated content. A tension between tradition and change emerges from this discussion and is evident at two levels. First, the world of practice seems to straddle the re-enactment of established forms and tinkering with alternative pathways. Second, the modes of inquiry oscillate between using existing concepts to look at new phenomena and taking advantage of these phenomena to rethink these concepts and come up with new ones. The paper concludes by identifying shortcomings in the existing scholarship and suggesting avenues for future studies to overcome them. It suggests how scholarship on online news production could contribute to rethinking some of the fundamental building blocks of understanding communication and society in the contemporary media environment."

Negativity, however, is not exclusively an American phenomenon; hence, the present study serves a dual purpose: First it aims to further develop and adapt the existing theories on the dynamics of negativity. Second it supplements the existing literature by exploring the dynamics of negativity in a multiparty system. By studying six different channels of party communication in four Danish national election campaigns it is shown that alternative government parties  in accordance with the existing theories  are more negative than incumbent parties, and that ideology is (indirectly) correlated with the campaign tone. As opposed to the existing literature, losing parties are not more negative than winning ones in this study. Next, the study proposes that a partys proportion of party identified voters and its rhetorical tone is negatively correlated and that parties go negative on issues that they enjoy issue ownership of."

In fact for most young Americans, digital media is mass media. But mere computer ownership
or even casual use does not make the user digitally savvy and able to interact
fully with digital content, especially create it. The degree to which first-
generation Hispanics have access to and utilize digital media may have much to
do with both characteristics of their lives in the United States, as it may with
their countries of origin. The digital divide in Latin America is more of a canyon
that varies by country, as other scholars have noted. Looking at a college-aged
demographic in Miami, a unique laboratory for studying Hispanics originating
from various nations, this study will examine the role of income, sex, race and
country of origin in the digital divide, with an eye on classroom success and
eventual employment in a mass communication field as a standard."

This paper reviews the Report & Order, assessing the validity of the Commissions central arguments used to justify its position, and posits that these arguments are largely unsubstantiated. The Commission clings to weak (and often insignificant) statistical findings, contestable assertions and stakeholder comments, while ignoring statistically significant empirical data that refutes each claim. The public outcry against further media consolidation and dissenting opinions from Congress are also ignored. Baffled by the lack of empirical evidence presented by the FCC to justify such a major (and unpopular) decision, this study finds it hard to look past the cynical suggestion that the Commission placed the demands of the corporate media lobby ahead of all other considerations."

Challenging Gendered and Raced Technologies Through Media Activism,Building Capital and Bridging Community With ICTs,"This paper follows media activists who base their efforts to reform the media system on broadening access to technological artifacts and skills. These activists clearly intend for technological engagement to be ecumenical and compatible with a range of social identities, across boundaries of gender and race, but their hopes are not always matched by the reality. In practice, it remains difficult to cultivate forms of technical affinity and expertise that are not associated with white masculinity, though the activists strategy of technological intervention is in this case arguably more successful with regard to inclusion of women than of people of color. Media activism thus provides a distinct site at which to analyze ethnographically the consequences of purposive engagement with technology, as well as being a critical locus of intervention in the wider array of advocacy and activist efforts meant to secure a more democratic media environment."

By utilizing health behavior theories, we developed comparative hypotheses and then used a pen and paper survey of over 500 male and female adolescents to identify various gender-specific motivational forces for dieting. We found that there are number of theory-based antecedents within each gender which can help to develop gender-specific health communication programs. The findings of the study will be useful in promoting healthy eating patterns and nutrition approaches for adolescents."

We need to imagine a more robust form of public service based on the pursuit of a communicative relationship between citizens that is irreducible to both commercial and propagandistic principles. Instead, public service media must aim to engage ordinary people, irrespective of their purchasing power, geographical location or social position, in a dialogue about public life that contributes to public action. My presentation will assess the challenges facing UK public service media today and draw on historical policy proposals to sketch out a concept of public media suited to the digital age as well as to the current crisis of neo-liberalism."

Exploring this everyday practical rhetoric of communication in samples of metadiscourse mostly taken from the Internet, we find that it is quite a bit richer and more theoretically interesting than scholars tend to assume. The claim that everyday thinking about communication is based on an implicit transmission or conduit model has become something of a cliché among some theorists. The most frequently cited empirical evidence derives from Michael J. Reddys 1979 study of the conduit metaphor. Reddy analyzed some 140 common English expressions, such as put your ideas into words, get your thoughts across, and his meaning came through to me and showed that they are based on an underlying conceptual metaphor in which language functions like a conduit, transferring thoughts bodily from one person to another. While critical of the conduit metaphor, Reddy himself apparently assumed that communication can be nothing other than sheer transmission (sending-receiving information) and so, of course, that is all he was able to see. An empirical exploration of ordinary metadiscourse based on less restrictive assumptions quickly begins to suggest a more complex picture. The everyday rhetoric of communication often does, in fact, reflect assumptions of a transmission or conduit model. However, it also uses a range of other vocabularies, metaphors, and conceptual frameworks, including some that point in the general direction of models now preferred by communication theorists, views of communication that could be described as transactional, emergent, systemic, ritual, social constructionist, or indeed, constitutive."
2009-0170,Beyond the Content: Emphasizing Technological Features in Programmatic Variable-Centered Video Game Research,Keyword: Technology (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Beyond the Content: Emphasizing Technological Features in Programmatic Variable-Centered Video Game Research,Keyword: Technology (Cross Unit),"Much empirical research into the social impact of video games and virtual environments has focused on content variables such as violence or sexual portrayals. Less thoroughly investigated are technological elements of such games. This is a noticeable shortcoming given that a number of researchers and policymakers have expressed concerns that technological advancements may exacerbate video games effects. Recent research has begun to address this deficiency in the literature, but more is needed, particularly research that produces an enduring understanding of video game technologys effects that is not rendered obsolete as new game technologies are developed. Using the guidance of variable-centered conceptual approaches to treat technological dimensions as part of a mix of attributes that contribute to video games effects, programmatic research can continue to explore the effects of various technological dimensions of video games to inform our understanding of not only todays video games, but whatever the future may bring."

While this criticism seems more than plausible in relation to many postmodern perspectives, not all post projects are subject to this evaluation. Postcolonial theory offers many possibilities for interrogating the political that have hitherto been ignored by many modernist theories. Through an examination of the intersections and connections between the work of Homi Bhabha and Jürgen Habermas, a recasting of the modern/postmodern debate is possible: the Habermasian notion of discourse finds support in Bhabhas work, opening up our political theories to yet unanticipated spaces and subaltern notions of silence, non-sense, and rumor. Taking cue from Bhabhas understanding of the possibilities produced by the tensions of marginalized histories we may begin to recognize the Habermasian notion of counterfactuality as a similar source of tension and possible resistance."

In this research we look at bias in Dutch newspaper coverage. Combining different researchers using the same content analysis method we were able to investigate a three year-period of political communication in the Netherlands. During this period there was a change of coalition government from a central right government to a central left government. Beside this traditional left/right dimension of politics, representing the social economic dimension in politics, we also included the GAL/TAN dimension representing the social cultural dimension in politics. We did not found a clear overall bias among newspapers. They tend to follow the politicians in power. Among the traditional newspapers we did find traces from the old alignments with political parties."

Three sister dyads and one sister triad audio-taped naturally-occurring interaction during the Big Sisters visits home on weekends or college breaks. Segments of conversation which appeared relevant to sibling role enactment were identified and transcribed according to Jeffersons (1984) transcript notation system. Analysis of the transcripts initially appeared to support the literature on Older Siblings exerting influence in interaction with Younger Siblings through the issuing of multiple claims of authority. However, Little Sisters quite often failed to respond to those claims with the deference the traditional literature on family and interpersonal communication suggests they do. Rather, these Little Sisters often resisted their Big Sisters claims of authority by 1) directly disagreeing, 2) addressing a different aspect of the interaction such that the trajectory of the conversation shifted, or 3) not addressing the claim at all. Consequently, enacting Big Sister and Lil Sister roles appears to include interactionally pursuing and defending claims of authority by the former and interactionally resisting such claims by the latter. This study contributes to our understandings of family/interpersonal communication by 1) explicating the conversational practices siblings use in enacting their family roles, and 2) demonstrating that theory and research based primarily upon self-report data and lacking close analysis of family members actual talk may tell us more about what theorists, researchers, and ordinary folks think theyre doing in conversation than it does about what they are doing in their everyday talk."

The genre is a conspicuous space of inclusion of images of women, especially black women, on television. Yet what types of discourses shape the identities of black women reality stars and the audience engagement with those star images? What are we to make of these images that in some way claim to be legitimate reflections of society? Investigating the representational discourses that shape the identities of black women stars of reality shows, including Tyra Banks, Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, and Tiffany Pollard, I ask how the slippage between fiction and reality characteristic of both reality television and star image allows audiences to believe, especially regarding those unlike them, that the images they see are real.

They search for spectacle and mediatized point-counterpoint and find them almost entirely absent. They posit the lack of satire and lampoon  especially of national leaders  as evidence of repression. Within this worldview, there is little debate in Rwanda and robust debate in the U.S. This conclusion reveals much about U.S.-driven I.R. scholarship, but offers scant empirical evidence of the democratic health of either nation. This leaves us with little more than a paradox: our culture renders us (nearly) blind to debate that is not consonant with our cultural expectations. Recognizing this paradox is a powerful first step in crafting robust rhetorical democracies. Reflecting upon the Rwanda case, we can see that debate exists in places and forms that dont typically count. To the extent that we can uncover these forms and recover their potential for our citizenry, we can learn a great deal about our (argument) culture from the land of a thousand hills."
2009-0176,"Blogging as a Form of Journalism: A Model Linking Perception, Motivation, and Behavior",Journalism Studies Poster Session,,,,Paper,"Blogging as a Form of Journalism: A Model Linking Perception, Motivation, and Behavior",Journalism Studies Poster Session,"Blogs have become a fixture of todays digital media landscape, growing not only in number (with an estimated 100 million blogs and counting) but also in influence on political communication and (mass) media discourse. Likewise, in recent years academic research on blogging has proliferated, most of it describing blogs and their role in politics and interpersonal discourse. Yet, relatively little work has analyzed the role of blogging as a journalistic practice. We aim to shed light on how certain bloggers perceive their blogs as a form of journalism, and the extent to what this perception may have an influence on bloggers motivations to post and what to post about. And, most importantly, this paper seeks to construct a model by which all these antecedents may explain whether bloggers behave like professional journalists. From a psychological theory perspective, this paper explores the link among perceptions, motivations, and behaviors. Psychologists have long studied the roles of cognition and motivation in influencing behavior, but few scholars have undertaken research on the connection of these elements as they relate to bloggers. Moreover, many observers, particularly journalists working in the mainstream media, have argued for a marked distinction between blogging and journalism, linking the former to freewheeling opinion and the latter to verifiable information. We put this claim to an empirical test. Results indicate that having a better understanding of the perceptions, motivations and topical focus of bloggers can help us clarify the blurring intersection online of blogging and journalism."

The study also explored the relationship between the same dispositions and blogging frequency. Overall, 356 bloggers completed an online survey instrument. Regression analysis provided support for both hypotheses. Bloggers with higher self-monitoring skills had a more private orientation towards their blogging privacy management practices. Bloggers CFA level was related to more public and open blogging permeability rules. High self-monitors and high CFA dispositions were positively related to blogging frequency. Implications of the study to current CMC theory and research is discussed."
2009-0178,Blogging vs. Diary-Keeping: Psychological Empowerment,Keywords in Information Systems: Interactivity (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,Blogging vs. Diary-Keeping: Psychological Empowerment,Keywords in Information Systems: Interactivity (High Density),"A one-way experiment (N = 130) examined the relative empowering benefits of journaling about ones personal life in a public blog as opposed to a private diary. Despite often being likened to each other, our findings reveal that these two forms of writing are very distinct both theoretically and practically. While diary-keeping leads to a deep sense of autonomy & control, blogs foster a strong sense of influence. Moreover, while the relationship between diary-keeping and autonomy & control is mediated by the sense of agency, the one between blogging and sense of influence is mediated by sense of community. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are outlined in the end."

One issue that has made its way into the documentary arena is the growing practice of transplant tourism around the world. This essay explores representation of culture, globalization and the body in documentaries on the black market organ trade. Through critical discourse analysis I work to uncover theparticular understanding that is being shaped by these stories and film formats. In particular this essay focuses on seeing the body as a knowledge source, the voices that are priviledged in creating that knowledge and how agency is constructed at these intersections."

In the context of the global exchange and consumption of cultural forms, the dance has experienced changes in its aesthetic, phenomenological, discursive, and affective levels, deterritorializing it from the Argentine nation-state machine, and territorializing it on diverse cultural formations, such as the pursuing of a transcendental spirituality, or the resistance to the commodification of the life-world. This paper examines assemblages that provide cohesiveness to Argentine tango dancing, focusing on the exploration of the modus of operation and the connections between the different bodies that constitute it and the bodies formed by communities operating at the local, national, and transnational level."

Regarding body shape, mass media offer plenty of upward comparisons and attainment advice on diets etc. This experiment (n = 167) manipulated attainability to examine comparison choices through selective exposure to ideal body ads. Participants browsed a computerized magazine while browsing was logged. Ads showed ideal body types versus normal body types, embedded in body shaping articles for the experimental group and in unrelated articles for the control group. Body dissatisfaction led to more ideal body ad exposure in the experimental group but less exposure in the control group."

Through virtual ethnography, participant observation and in-depth interviews within Second Life, this study will attempt to shed some light into this cyberculture conforming phenomenon. While this study is still a work in progress, the emphasis of this paper is to examine bodies of literature that touch on issues present in cyberculture, visual communication and gender studies. The methods of the study will explore these issues at greater length, however for the purpose of this paper the focus will be on one in-depth interview that reveals some interesting findings regarding the nature, practice and purpose of hypersexualized gender in a digital context."
2009-0183,Body Optimism,Body Talk (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Body Optimism,Body Talk (Cross Unit),"This paper addresses film form and narrative, with an eye to asking how embodied feeling might provoke new social attachments. The kind of attachment I have in mind is friendship, and the films are By Hook or By Crook (2002) and Brokeback Mountain (2005). Both are queer class texts, and while both are beloved by audiences, each promises something quite different in the look, tale and feel of friendship, in scenes of anti-queer constraint and class deprivation. I argue in favor of the low-budget solidarities and aesthetic energies of By Hook over Brokebacks grandeur, bad attachment and solemn march toward death.

With this comparison, I hope to renew interest in friendship as embodied feeling (not ideology) and as social form and undersung political resource. What can friendships optimism do for cultural politics that romantic melodramain life as in filmcannot?"
2009-0184,"Body, Writing, Telecommunication",Body Talk (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,"Body, Writing, Telecommunication",Body Talk (Cross Unit),"Most people know the feeling of getting absorbed on-line. Hit some keys, get a response, hit again, another response, again, again, again  until one loses track of time. This odd little phenomenon is a large part of what computers feel like, of how computers' relation to the body is experienced. The interpretations of this experience, as the internet has spread across the globe, are kaleidoscopic: computers have been called, to name a few attributions, addictive, exhilarating, enlightening, stupefying, isolating, and community-building.

My interest is not in declaring which of these interpretations is correct, but in how different interpretations figure in the construction of computers themselves. The compulsive ""pleasures"" of computing have in a sense become part of how the modern world imagines itself. In the contemporary moment, this metaphorical role may be a more important effect of the internet than its actual technical capacities."

An experiment utilized a false test feedback design to uncover the direction of the MUM effect (i.e., whether MUM effect results from reluctance to share bad news or eagerness to share good news). Participants (N = 114) delivered good, neutral, or bad news (i.e., high, medium, low score) to a stranger. News valence, delay before response, and reluctance were measured. Senders viewed high scores as more positive than medium scores, which were viewed as more positive than low scores. Delay before response as well as reluctance also appeared to be linearly related to test score. When scores were high, senders experienced minimal reluctance and shortest delays. When scores were low, reluctance was higher and delay was greater. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed."
2009-0187,Breaking the Glass Ceiling in the Newsroom:The Empowerment Experience of Female Journalists,News and Gender,,,,Paper,Breaking the Glass Ceiling in the Newsroom:The Empowerment Experience of Female Journalists,News and Gender,"This study investigates the empowerment experience of female journalists in the newsroom by employing Longwes empowerment model which consists of five hierarchical levels of equality, namely, welfare, access, conscientization, participation and control. The factors affecting female journalists empowerment are also examined at macro-social, meso-organizational, as well as micro-individual level.

Indepth interviews on veteran female journalists from different news organizations were conducted. Results show that female journalists are not fully empowered in the newsroom. Empowerment is more likely to happen at the lower level of welfare and access. At the level of conscientization and participation, empowerment experiences are limited. Female journalists cannot achieve empowerment at all at the highest control level. Gender inequality still exists in the newsroom and glass ceiling effect persists

Among all factors affecting female journalists empowerment experiences, factors at the meso-organizational level, including macho newsroom culture, hierarchical newsroom structure, nature of news work and working environment are found to be the most immediate and important. Despite increased number of female journalists in the field, and the fact that more female journalists got promoted, the newsroom culture and practices continue to subdue female journalists to the patriarchal newsroom culture, which often cultivates them to adopt male values and conform to the male-dominated environment."

During development, the SAP developers provided support for the business end-users. The hand-off from a developer team to a companys team that will provide support for end users (after the developers leave) is typically fraught with numerous communication gaps. Using an adaptation of Dervins Sense-Making Methodology, it was possible to elicit deeper knowledge from the developers. This, in turn, facilitated communication between the teams overcoming several of these typical communication gaps."

Although structured by FCC constraints, cable franchising promised an important new policy role for citizens in identifying and negotiating for local and subaltern communicational needs and desires. This study examines how media activists sought to translate federal policy into workable local solutions, drawing on competing visions of local identity and cultural citizenship. The study indicates the conditions within which a media-minded public can emerge and organize itself for reform, but also illustrates the often gendered pitfalls of the policy translation process in the struggle for more democratic media."
2009-0190,Broadcasting Global Cities: Architecture as Mediated Centrality,The New Media City,,,,Paper,Broadcasting Global Cities: Architecture as Mediated Centrality,The New Media City,"Saskia Sassen has argued that instead of neutralizing geography, information technologies contribute to the spatial centralization of headquarters functions, especially of the more advanced users and providers to the most advanced urban economies (2006:193). As a global media city, London is a centre for media industry headquarters, for cultural markets and symbolic production. The British Broadcasting Corporation is an example of a media organization that expresses this global centrality, as it has long been used for both the spread of British culture and as a role model for news. In this mobile digital media era, the BBC is undertaking A Return to Form, an architectural statement, which in London means the evacuation of the world renown home of the World Service, Bush House to move into the newly renovated and rebuilt 1920s headquarters Broadcasting House. Media buildings are of a paradoxal nature: providing a site to that which is site-less, solidifying that which is immaterial, centralising that which is ubiquitous. We focus on how the architectural form and organization reflect media technologies and ideologies; how the BBC buildings mirror the values and ethos of the media organizations and the relations between these and society."

Ratings are presented as objective knowledge of audiences and crucial to broadcasting and advertising industry. However, the lessons from the history of the development of ratings systems show the technical difficulty to measure audience, and the main function of ratings, which is controlling audiences. Audience is a fictional construct by ratings discourse, and ratings have been constructed by complex networks of broadcasters, advertisers, and government. To these complex networks, ratings do matter because of credibility, rather than accuracy. One major argument of this study is the way in which broadcasting ratings system works is the same logic of property simulation in bureaucratic institutions."
2009-0192,Brown Men of the Middle East: The Politics of Islamophobia,Representation and Rejection: Rearticulating Fear Through Brown,,,,Paper,Brown Men of the Middle East: The Politics of Islamophobia,Representation and Rejection: Rearticulating Fear Through Brown,"Once the signifier of an exoticism, brown has come to embody the menacing Other in the post-9/11 geopolitical imagination. In this context, the racist imagination does not appeal to race to posit the inferiority of an Other but to establish cultural differences and their insurmountability. This paper offers a genealogical sketch of the figure of the Muslim Other as it is figured in the post-Cold War popular and political imaginary. It argues that culture has acquired a putative explanatory power in addressing the post-Cold War geopolitics in order to evade the politics of the emergence of the Muslim Other. The notion of Islamophobia is viewed as an ideological response that not only empties politics from (international) politics by attributing to Islam the ills of international community but also by conflating politics, histories, and conflicts of various societies into a unified and negative conception of Islam as ideology, which is then deemed incompatible with Euro-Americaness. I argue that the irreducibility of this absolute Otherness of Muslim Other is a projection of an inherent antagonism at the heart of our global impossible society. In this context, the category of brown is undergoing a transformation in conjunction with the deepening of Islamophobia, a formation that posits brown, as a strategy of identification, as alterity to the Euro-Americanness, as terror and threat."

Images not only speak louder than words, they also offer considerable mnemonistic qualities. This institutionalization of the arts through art collections, sponsorship and extensive use of the arts in advertising results in creative synergies.

Société Générale offers a prime example of this museification of corporate space, further reinforced by the spill-over effect of its corporate collection in its advertising and internal communication strategies.

The paper seeks to define the central role of the iconographic sign in this new architecture of communication. As a visual identifier, it contributes to institutional differentiation and reputation management, addressing the dual level of aesthetic and ethical perception. Their commitment to the arts enables banks to build institutional identity and customer loyalty, indispensable factors of success in a turbulent financial environment."

Yet the narrative that emerged and gained hegemony rendered 9/11 as merely a singular point in an epic narrative colored by a steady occurrence of systematic exploitation and repression of minority groups. The collective memory that was concretized in hip hop culture soon after 9/11 therefore declared the event a Washington conspiracy to license the maintenance of status quo through the perpetuation of institutionalized violence. Through an examination of references to 9/11 in hip hop, the historical narratives in which they are grounded, and the rituals by which such claims are enforced and legitimated, I explain how the hip hop community successfully constructed this counter-narrative and discuss its implications for group identity and political empowerment. Drawing from literature on race and conspiracy theory, group identity, and political mobilization in my analysis, I explore how hip hops perception of 9/11 serves to further solidify a distinct collective identity while engaging individuals across racial boundaries, effectively transforming cultural discourse into forceful political action."

This social ritual--enacted and performed through singing, eating, and toasting--involves specific occasions, participants, and behavioral sequences. It has become a major site for relationship building, for which content-oriented face-to-face interaction must be reconfigured for the karaoke experience. Talk that allows parties to share their thoughts or negotiate business deals directly are no longer keys to business negotiation, but must assume a different posture after people have ""sung together."" Performing such social rituals essentially redefines Taiwanese relationships and business negotiation practices."
2009-0196,Buying Not Buying: Buy Nothing Day and Consumer Activism,Corporate Politics/ Consumer Politics,,,,Paper,Buying Not Buying: Buy Nothing Day and Consumer Activism,Corporate Politics/ Consumer Politics,"Not buying, or boycotting, is a long standing tradition in consumer activism. While many boycotts have been directed at specific corporations or industries (Cohen 2003; Friedman 1985; Garrett 1987; Kozinets & Handelman 2004; Smith 1990) there are some that have been more general. Buy Nothing Day, for example, has become an annual celebration for numerous people around the world. Different from previous boycotts, it has taken the very idea of unchecked consumerism as its target. How then does Buy Nothing Day fit into this history of consumer activism? This question is addressed by looking at websites and videos from BND activists as well as press coverage globally and historically.
This paper looks at BND by way of three elements: (1) modes of protest, (2) stated message(s), and (3) intended target. The mode includes the kinds of protests held on BND as well as media produced. The message includes reasons given by activists for participating and proclamations made to their audience. Finally, the intended target is understood as the audience or the primary site where change is expected to occur. While the mode of BND is similar to other consumerism activism, its messages and target are very different. Unlike previous decades consumer activism, it is focused on encouraging change in individuals not institutions. Through this analysis Buy Nothing Day is shown to be highly tied to niche marketing practices (Turow 2006)."

Many of the concepts posited by these theories have proved inadequate for analyzing and explicating movements beyond these cultural contexts. This theoretical essay conducts a critical analysis of the current theoretical work on social movements in communication studies and utilizes a rhetorical analysis of the Burmese protests of 2007 to calibrate theoretical understandings. The essay first describes the relevant Burmese historical and cultural context, identifies and critiques the relevant literature and its underlying assumptions, and analyzes the chanting of the Mettā Sutta (Discourse on Loving-Kindness) as political expression using traditional notions and invitational notions (Foss & Griffin, 1995) of rhetoric. The study found that theory has assumed movements operate using oppositional rhetorical forms, develop according to modernist conceptions of time, are leader-driven, possess a unified membership, and must build a credible image and acquire power. Based on the rhetorical forms in the Burmese protests, these assumptions have proved insufficient. The study recommends eschewing these assumptions and enriching theory further by studying movements in Asia and elsewhere in the world."

Is a radical transformation of the social function of photography taking place that would entail a specificity of the uses of the cell phone device? Unquestionably, those everyday life photos, more spontaneous, more intimate and emotional too, are user-generated content that take part in the construction of personal and social identity in real time  it can indeed be noted that temporality in the act of taking pictures has changed. However, most of what used to be at stake in traditional photography is still important, for instance the issue of the trace, of the authentication and evidence of the past reality. But a new question arises: could it be that those pictures are less worthy of becoming images? Are they more precarious? For two constraints remain: one is economic, the other one is technical. What young people do, therefore, is set up a real rationality of the uses in order to arbitrate between the various devices available. The manufacturers/carriers wish to have the cell phone become the one and ultimate device does not seem to have been fulfilled in France as yet. The methodology applied is combined: one quantitative part contains a survey including short descriptions of almost 500 photos, and one qualitative part, which is based on semi-directive interviews among 20 persons between 18 and 24 years about their uses of camera phones compared with those of digital cameras."

Online vloggers  mostly young and queer  have infused camp with a neoliberal sense of individuality, emotional authenticity and personal development, thereby challenging historical understandings of camp as wholly ironic and disengaged or politically charged.

This in a country with a history of highly fragmented broadcasting audiences, including a propensity to spend over 75% of TV viewing time with foreign, largely American, entertainment programming sources. Indeed the shorthand for foreign broadcasting domination of a domestic audiences media use is Canadianization. Is there something about the historical struggle by CBC/Radio-Canada to maintain and, indeed, constantly re-define its public service role in a sea of commercial American programming that has equipped Canada to be prepared for a truly globalized mediascape? Are there lessons to be learned about new ways for indigenous public service media (PSM) beyond Canadian borders in the new digital landscape?"

Children were assigned to one of three experimental conditions, using different combinations (or none) of Panwapa videos, online games, and hands-on materials.
Observations of use, pretest-posttest interviews, and supplemental teacher and parent interviews revealed similarities and differences across cultures. In all countries, children showed similar engagement with and comprehension of the materials. Moreover, understanding of global citizenship increased significantly more among Panwapa users than the control group (p < .05 or greater), with effects most consistent regarding economic disparity.
Data also highlighted the importance of cultural context. For example, significant growth appeared in Mexican and Chinese childrens awareness of other languages, but not the U.S., where the sample was more linguistically diverse. Adult interviews revealed additional factors, e.g., a Chinese cultural trend against computers as educational tools for young children.
Thus, educational media can promote global citizenship among children in various countries, but this learning is influenced by childrens culture and experience. Implications for media research and design will be discussed."

Analysis documented for the first time that, throughout the course of a campaign, public opinion fluctuates in tandem with the saliency of candidate attributes emphasized in the news. We also found an important consequence of attribute agenda setting, affective priming of candidate attributes, by which the prominent tone of the media's candidate attributes functions as a criterion for evaluating a candidate's suitability. Finally, this public evaluative tone was linked with voting intentions for the candidate's political party."

This study utilized an experimental design to test several questions regarding very young childrens (6-25 months) learning from video. Specifically, I examined a phenomenon referred to as the video deficit, the tendency for babies to learn more from live information than they do when identical information is presented on a screen. Therefore, this experiment tested the age at which the video deficit occurs and two possible factors that may influence it. First, it appears that the deficit is most pronounced between 12-20 months for both imitation and word learning. Second, I sought to examine the effect of multiple viewing on the video deficit. Overall, there does not seem to be an amelioration of the video deficit as a result of repeat exposure for all children. Rather, for imitation, babies older than 20 months, but not younger and mid-range babies, were aided by multiple viewing. In terms of word learning, multiple viewing had a positive effect on younger and older babies but not on those in the middle cohort. Third, I sought to test if social relevancy, or watching mothers vs. strangers, helped mitigate the video deficit. Overall, babies do learn better from mothers on video than from strangers on video; however, there was no interaction with age, suggesting that social relevancy helps babies across all age groups and does not follow the general pattern of the remaining data whereby the video deficit could be overcome for younger and older babies but not for those in the middle cohort."

The current study tests whether interdependent self-construal can be primed for participants who have been described as exhibiting consistently more independence using the pronoun circling and the Sumerian warrior priming tasks contrasted against TST, open-ended essays, and all items from the combined Gudykunst et al. (1996), Singelis (1994) and Kim and Leung (1996) self construal scales. This study used a 4 (priming task) x 3 (type of self-construal) between subjects factorial design with at least 30 participants in each of 12 conditions. Results showed that there were no significant differences in interdependent scores between the mean scores for I and We primes suggesting that priming had not occurred regardless of priming type (I or We), priming task (Pronoun search or Sumerian Warrior Story) or response task (SC, TST, essay) for respondents in this study. This result is supported both overall (for all priming conditions) and in each of the 12 priming conditions of the study. These results were also consistent with results obtained in the non-priming control conditions. The implications of these findings for self identity and cross-cultural research are discussed."

Evidence From the Netherlands and Belgium,cial Networking and Community Building in Appropriations of Media and Communication Technologies,,,,Paper,Can Turkish Women in the Diaspora Build Social Capital? Evidence From the Netherlands and Belgium,Social Networking and Community Building in Appropriations of Media and Communication Technologies,"There is a fine line between the seemingly positive notion of building social capital and previously discarded, but more newly resurgent notions of assimilation as legislated by the fear-driven governments across the West. Ever since Robert Putnam (2000) made social capital a concept that should be mourned for its decline in the United States, researchers and policymakers in a number of Western countries have adopted it as a solution to the failed practices of multiculturalism This is a comparative study of attitudes, media use, and the bridging and bonding of social capital in Turkish migrants in the Netherlands and in Flanders based on survey and extended interviews. The study focuses on the problems women in both countries have in forming relationships and building social capital outside their own ethnic communities. Government policies aimed at better integration of ethnic minorities may be having a reverse effect to that which is intended. The outcome of this research suggests that proactive efforts to link to ethnic women by both government and the media are necessary if real integration is ever to take place."

The first one involves an information culture established throughout the history of the country. That culture is dominated by authority-imposed attitudes and collective values. It shapes not only the online space, but also all media regardless of its particular format. The second realm of power is the state-controlled traditional media sphere where news go through a political filter and the Internet gets framed in a certain restricted manner. The third domain is that of the legislative and technological frameworks intended to directly control online content."

Questions remain, however, as to whether BAS is a uni- or multi-dimensional construct, and whether a range of risky health behaviors align with predictions about how BIS and BAS operate. Using a sample of college undergraduates from four universities (N = 1014), confirmatory factor analyses revealed that BAS is best conceptualized as four distinct constructs represented by the Reward Responsiveness, Drive, and Fun Seeking subscales. Relationships between these subscales and such behaviors as sex, alcohol consumption, drug use, safety, tobacco use, inactivity, and diet further supported this claim, with results varying in magnitude and direction across the BAS constructs. Future persuasive communication campaigns can benefit, however, by considering commonalities across the behaviors studied."
2009-0209,Cascading Troubles in the Organization of Repair,Advances in the Study of Self-Initiated Repair,,,,Paper,Cascading Troubles in the Organization of Repair,Advances in the Study of Self-Initiated Repair,"In this report we describe the phenomenon of cascading troubles in the organization of repair for conversation. For a trouble to cascade from a prior trouble, the source of the subsequent trouble has to be found in the repair solution to the previous trouble, so that the repair itself becomes a source of trouble (rather than simply occurring within the same turn, but being incidental to the original repair). Cascading sources of trouble and their repair can be seen in the following extracts:

In the first case an individual self-reference is first replaced with a collective self-reference and then the latter is expanded into an enumerated collectivity (Lerner and Kitzinger, 2007) that explicitly names the newly added member of the just-aggregated self-reference. In the second case a collective self-reference is replaced with an recipient reference and then the action formulation now associated with that referent (found) as part of the post-frame of the repair is replaced with another, perhaps more suitable action formulation.

For the most part we focus on what can be characterized as turn-constructional or turn-compositional repairs as in the above extracts, but we will also show that this phenomenon extends both to what can be characterized as turn-allocational repairs and to remediation of actions realized through body behavior. While turn-compositional repair concerns self-initiated repair that targets the composition of a turn at talk (Schegloff, Jefferson and Sacks, 1977; Jefferson 1974), turn-allocational repair can be thought of as those practices that can affect the composition of a turn at talk, but that are aimed at repairing troubles in one-at-a-time speaking and establishing recipiency (Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson, 1974; Schegloff, 1987, 2000; Lerner, 1989; Goodwin, 1979, 1980). Both turn-allocational repair and remediation of body-behaviorally realized action concern the coordination of action between participants and we will show that they too can be responsive to cascading sources troubles."
2009-0210,Centrality of News Article in the Blogosphere,Newsworthiness and Gatekeeping,,,,Paper,Centrality of News Article in the Blogosphere,Newsworthiness and Gatekeeping,"This paper proposes a theory about the centrality of news articles in the blogosphere. The proposed theory hypothesizes that both newsworthiness of events and prominence of articles on a news website are positively related with centrality of news articles in the blogosphere, and that perceived personal expertise moderates these relationships such that original correlations are diminished with the existence of bloggers' perceived personal expertise. Two dimensions of newsworthiness are considered: deviance of the news event, and social significance of the news event. Two dimensions of centrality of news article are considered: article popularity in the blogosphere, and article importance within blog entries.

Empirical data from a content analysis of the most-blogged-about articles on The New York Times' website in 2008 show that deviance of news events is significantly correlated with article popularity, whereas social significance of news events is significantly correlated with article importance within blog entries. Personal expertise only moderates one relationship: it eliminates the original direction of the relationship between social significance of news events and article importance in blog entries. The findings contribute to the understanding of the news media-blogosphere relationship, and also validate the active role of bloggers suggested in recent literature. The empirical data also suggest new directions to refine the proposed theory regarding the relationship between different dimensions of the construct newsworthiness and different dimensions of the construct centrality of news article in the blogosphere."

It is argued that a major concept in media scholarship that has not received enough treatment from current research; challenge. The challenge concept in video game research is discussed and explicated. A definition using mental models is proposed, with special focus regarding the rule-based elements of video game play, game mechanics. Game mechanics are defined and discussed with the potential for empirical testing in mind. Implications for the use of challenge, mental models, and game mechanics in future research and game design, especially education game design, are discussed."

Not only its internal political conditions have changed, but the new international order conditions have also changed. Mexicos destiny was linked to those of the United States and Canada since 1994 due to NAFTA not only due to commercial and political interests but because international terrorism and drug traffic is a major concern for the North American region.
From the year 2005 onwards, the NAFTA partnership evolved into a treaty known as the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP).
Today SPP arrangements imply commitments in areas in which the three partners must be committed not only in the commercial arena but in other areas as well, and all of them involve the linkage of their communication systems. Therefore, Mexican Communication Policies and regulations must evolve, especially in the arena of telecommunications, for it is imperative that the Mexican communication carriers comply with North American standards and regulations within the context of SPP.
This paper presents an overview of the challenges that the Mexican Communication Policies and Regulations face within the context of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP)."

Specifically, it seeks to understand how dramatists working on BBC World Service Trust projects go about developing cultural fluency, how this assists them in their role as cultural translators, and how they engage in creative decision making during drama for development production. The paper also proposes an analytical framework to map the creative decisions made by dramatists, for the purposes of analysis  in order to explore why dramatists sometimes choose to reinforce and sometimes choose to challenge local cultural."

Analyzing one of these participatory urban media organizations - the digital storytelling organization BBOT-BNA (a combination of abbreviations of the Dutch 'Brussel Behoort Ons Toe' and the French 'Bruxelles Nous Appartient', both meaning 'Brussels Belongs To Us') - allows for a closer look at the construction of a Brussels urban community. These kinds of media organizations remain crucial for reinforcing the democratic potential of an urban community, but especially the Flemish Community shows little interest in the democratic role for participatory alternative media. Secondly, BBOT-BNA's acknowledgement of the existence of an urban
community, which needs to have its voices heard as a community, also finds little echoes at the institutional level. In contrast, sometimes there is even institutional resistance against the development of an urban identity. This paper aims to analyze how BBOT-BNA deals with the tensions between its participatory-democratic objectives and its focus on the Brussels' urban community on the one hand, and the requirements imposed by the subsidizing institutions that target specific language groups on the other hand. More specifically, the paper will focus on the chameleon strategies that BBOT-BNA has developed when addressing these subsidizing institutions, embedded within these difficult political-institutional circumstances."

Nokias early investment and marketing of person-to-person picture messaging is juxtaposed to actual trends in user adoption and cultural appropriation, which in turn encouraged the cellular giant to deploy narrative practices based on perceived user needs and later focus on Internet-based services, such as online image sharing. The goal of this study is to highlight the complex contested ground onto which new media technologies emerge, while offering a partial, yet multilayered, cultural snapshot of the first few years of a still relatively new, but already pervasive, personal media tool."
2009-0217,Change: Young Voters Speak During the 2008 Presidential Primary Season,Youth and Politics,,,,Paper,Change: Young Voters Speak During the 2008 Presidential Primary Season,Youth and Politics,"Change became the mantra of the 2008 Presidential primary campaign. Senators Clinton, McCain and Obama, as well as Governor Huckabee all used the idea of change as part of their campaign rhetoric. This study sought to determine what the youth vote believed that change meant, both in an overall sense and as attributed to each of the four candidates.
Seven-Hundred and Eighty four undergraduates from six states and nine Colleges and Universities participated in this study. Analysis of the open ended data found several overall categories of change and subsequent analysis found that these categories were more relevant to certain demographics than others. Further, the sources of information used by this population were much different than in prior elections. For example, friends and family were reported to be the most important source of political information while blogs were seldom mentioned as a source of political information.
The findings reveal that the candidates were effective in their use of the word change, as the respondents were able to differentiate between the different campaign messages. A discussion of the findings as well as ideas for future research is discussed."
2009-0218,Changing Characteristics of the Broadcast News Interview,Forms of Talk on Radio and Television,,,,Paper,Changing Characteristics of the Broadcast News Interview,Forms of Talk on Radio and Television,"Some of the most significant analyses of broadcast talk have been in the area of the news interview, where particular attention has been devoted to the performance of accountability through a blend of adversarialism and neutralism. In the UK context adversarialism (as well as neutralism) can be traced to specific developments in the evolution of public service broadcasting. This paper will explore the degree to which significant changes are taking place in the way accountability is performed in the context of UK public service television. It will suggest that there has been a shift from neutralism to argument and will consider some of the implications of this for the way we understand discursive change in an institutional context."

This study extends previous work on identity shift by examining the impact of affordances and certainty across face-to-face and computer-mediated presentations. Seventy-eight people produced either introverted or extroverted self-presentations either in a blog or in a video condition to test whether the asynchronicity and visual anonymity of computer-mediated communication (CMC) augment the effect of identity shift relative to face-to-face. The results indicate that for presentations of extroversion, presenting ones self virtually enhances identity shift relative to physical self-presentations as expected. And, consistent with the public commitment framework, being certain of the self-presentation mediates the effect of media on identity shift. Implications for future tests and areas of theoretical development in CMC research are discussed."
2009-0220,Changing Styles of News Presentation: The Performative Paradox,The Management of Mediated Performance,,,,Paper,Changing Styles of News Presentation: The Performative Paradox,The Management of Mediated Performance,"Television newsreading or newscasting entails a paradoxical kind of performance that rests upon reading from an autocue as if speaking directly to camera. In doing so, newsreaders must manage a dual orientation - on the one hand, to the prescripted matter of the news but, on the other, through direct visual address to the broadcast audience. Traditionally this performance has been managed through the adoption of in an institutional rather than a personal voice in which newsreaders project themselves as neither the author or the principal of the news text but simply animate it (Goffman). However, various pressures, of both an institutional and a broader social kind, are combining to undermine this strictly neutral style and to require newscasting to be performed in a more engaged fashion. There are various indices of these changes: ad libbing, facial expressiveness, postural shifts and so on. This paper will examine some of these shifts at work and point to the performative tensions that arise between older more formal styles of presentation and newer more interactive ones."

This paper examines Invisible Children to investigate what this new kind of media and youth advocacy organization might mean for the larger human rights movement. It opens with a brief discussion of the historical and political context for the conflict in northern Uganda, followed by a close examination of the original documentary. The paper then will explore the organizations use of multiple forms of media and how its later media products correct some of the initial documentarys weaknesses while inheriting others. Finally, the paper will examine Invisible Childrens effectiveness at engaging youth through hipster branding, a Web 2.0 approach and constant feedback mechanisms. The following study is based on analysis of Invisible Childrens multimedia products and newspaper coverage."
2009-0222,Channel- Versus Content-Oriented Media Use,Media Selection,,,,Paper,Channel- Versus Content-Oriented Media Use,Media Selection,"Departing from the channel- centered concept of media use, this study empirically examined the possibility that media use patterns center on particular content-types across different media channels. A factor analysis on the items tapping the use of various media channels (newspaper, television, and the Internet), which are further divided into specific contents consumed within each medium (N = 1000), yielded a five-factor solution. Among these factors, three were channel-bound, whereas two were content-bound. Results suggest that media users tend not only to use one particular channel for various contents, but also to pursue particular content types across various media outlets. This research also attempted to predict these channel- and content bound media use patterns by utilizing demographics, media use motives and interests. Results are discussed with regard to how the traditional channel-bound notion of media use is being challenged in the era of new media"

More specifically, we seek to examine the usefulness of a distinction between addiction and high engagement and assess the predictive validity of these concepts in the context of scholastic achievement. Three hundred and thirty three children aged 8  12 years from two primary schools in Singapore were selected to participate in this study. A survey utilizing Danforths Engagement-Addiction (II) scale and questions from DSM-IV was used to collect information from the schoolchildren, while their grades were obtained directly from the teachers. The findings suggest that boys spend more time playing video games and are more likely to report higher levels of addiction and engagement. The results also indicate that addiction tendencies are consistently negatively related to scholastic performance, while no such relationship is found for either time spent playing games or for video game engagement. The implications of these findings are discussed."

Using questionnaires, group based activities, and video diaries with 220 children between the ages of 8 and 15 across the UK (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales), we examined the role Newsround plays in fostering citizenship amongst its viewers. Of particular interest was the extent to which the children perceived it to be relevant to their engagement with the world, their views about the forms and practices of reporting (and attendant news values), and also the programs status as a resource for identity formation. The children provided insights into how Newsround could be further improved, especially with regard to its regional coverage as well as its web-based news provision. Issues around interactivity proved to be particularly salient, inviting questions about the extent to which the familiar conventions of childrens news reporting need to be reconsidered in order to better engage young people in a digital age. The childrens suggestions have been passed to the BBC. We argue that this form of participatory research is itself an example of citizenship in the making and can have a valuable function in informing the production of public service and educational media."

In a survey among 209 children and 96 adults, we investigated (1) how childrens understanding of advertiser tactics developed with age, and (2) at what age their understanding reached an adult-like level. Results showed that childrens understanding of advertiser tactics increased progressively between the ages of 8 and 12, showing a significant increase around age 10. In addition, the understanding that advertisers aim to elicit cognitive effects emerged at a later age than the understanding that advertisers aim to evoke affective and behavioral effects."

Social network analysis was used to examine four types of networks: Joint projects network,information exchange network,resource sharing network, and support network. Key actors in each network were highlighted. They were the ones in control of much information, in charge of coordination work among NGOs and having closing connections with the government and funding sources. In addition, all four networks had the core-periphery structure. Finally,the study suggested that geographic factor played an important role in communications and collaborations among NGOs."

The focus of the examination contains three aspects of news coverage: frame genres, visibility and valence. Employing a comparative case-oriented methodology, the coverage during Chinese president Xiannian Lis visit to the U.S. in 1985 as well as that during President Jintao Hus visit in 2006 are analyzed and compared. The study addresses some general characteristics and outcomes of American newspaper coverage about China. The main finding indicates that, although the amount of the coverage about China during the latter visit was largely increased over twenty years ago, the images of China presented in American newspapers and the medias tone toward the nation significantly turned more negative. The possible causes and factors are also discussed."

A survey of ethnic online community use and cultural adaptation was conducted with a total of 255 Chinese international students and scholars recruited from the ten universities hosting the largest number of international students. It was found that subjects spent much time on ethnic online communities and also visited frequently, with males spending more time than their female counterparts. Also, acquisition of information was found to be the strongest motive for Chinese students using ethnic online communities, while making friends was the least strong motive. Topics related to living in the United States, news about China and immigration/visas were also identified as content that Chinese students were most interested in while using ethnic online communities. Implications for the development of a new form of ethnic community online and its impact on Chinese sojourners cultural adaptation were also discussed."

Factor analysis revealed six frame dimensions: attribution of responsibility, human interests, economic consequence, denial and rescue/ treatment. Besides examination of the prevalence of frames in the articles, other two framing devices: headings and source types were also taken into consideration. Findings suggested that in both 2003 and 2008, party media and market-oriented media framed news in different ways. Peoples Daily most frequently used rescue frame in both year, and also frequently used leadership frames in the articles and headings. Government sources were cited most often in the news. Nanfang Weekend in 2003 and 2008 most frequently used human interest frames, and frequently used attribution frames. Non-government sources was the most often used source type in this paper. For the same media, in 2008, Peoples Daily used more human interest frame than in 2003. Nanfang Weekend also used more human interest frame in 2008, and doubled the use of non-government source when compared with 2003. Implications and other important findings were also discussed."

It will connect these films to the discourses surrounding identity and nationalism in a post-colonial environment. It will look at how these representations intersect with class, domestic family dynamics and hegemonic notions of nationalist identity. In doing so, it will also analyze how gay and lesbian characters are positioned within the main narrative. If we look at the globalization phenomenon in India, it is ironic how certain western discourses to do with development and progress, are unproblematically adopted by a country which views the West as a defiling agent otherwise. This contradiction comes through very strongly when dealing with homosexuality which is erroneously and conveniently attributed to western culture. This picking and choosing of modernity is a fascinating phenomenon that is also brought out in GLBT visibility in Indian cinema today.
These films thus offer a lot to be examined in terms of content, as well as packaging of same-sex desire. I will analyze these films according to how these characters are portrayed as gay/lesbian, their placement in the main narrative and their class identity. Some questions that I will attempt to answer in my analysis: How do these films offer positive spaces of visibility for these characters? Are the films with positive representations of gay characters really successful in breaking away from the homophobic portrayals of gay characters as seen in other films?"

I argue that a distinctly neoliberal model of public service is emerging in the US, which differs from the classic model in five intersecting ways: 1) public service is being redefined as the for-profit coordination of resources for privatized self and community care; 2) this public service model is increasingly integral to differentiating and producing network brand identities 3) TV networks and their websites provide branded ""interfaces"" for carrying out extra-textual citizenship practices (e.g. volunteerism, community involvement) 4) citizens are seen as enterprising agents rather than subjects to be uplifted; 5) new forms of interactivity are indispensable for offloading the costs of public service onto ""good citizens,"" whose labor is also exploited to build ""do good"" television brands. Examples include Planet Green, MTV Think, and ABC Better Community."
2009-0233,City Life and the Origins of Communication Theory,Keyword: Urban Communication,,,,Paper,City Life and the Origins of Communication Theory,Keyword: Urban Communication,"Theorists and historians of communication have searched for the origins of their field in the evolution of humans capacity for language, the rhetoric, ritual, and drama attendant to public life, the practical challenges of transporting messages across space and time, and even the spiritual mystery that attends our notions of a medium of communication.


Lurking at the edge of all those theoretical accounts stands humans historical experience of the city, as the species most profound and longstanding experiment in self invention. I want to argue that, over and over again, it has been the felt experience of city life that made communication a theoretical issue worth investigating, by casting groups into ever-changing relations to one another. Thus did the theory and practice of communication emerge simultaneously, but always as part of an attempt to understand the new forms of human habitation"

Using GPS-equipped mobile devices and cell phones, players of CitySneak are informed of the fixed surveillance cameras in a designated urban space. Players move through the space, attempting to navigate from a predetermined start point to an end without being seen by the camera. If players move within the designated fields of camera visibility, their phone controller notifies them that they have been seen, and the game is over. Confronting issues of surveillance in the urban environment places CitySneak in the realm of serious games, where contemporary social issues align with ludic engagement. It also plays a necessary role in the repurposing of locative media and ubiquitous technologies, engaging players in a critical exercise as they playfully negotiate the spaces of the city."
2009-0235,Civic Education for Deliberative Citizens: An Empirical Examination of the Effects of Civic Experiences in Schools,Youth and Politics,,,,Paper,Civic Education for Deliberative Citizens: An Empirical Examination of the Effects of Civic Experiences in Schools,Youth and Politics,"Analyzing the data from a nationally representative sample of 9th graders, this paper examines several hypotheses developed from the premises that first, individuals citizenship is to be constituted through their deliberative and participatory experiences; second, with provisions of civic curricula and opportunities for extra-curricular activities, public schools are a fertile ground for adolescents to acquire such experiences, and consequently to benefit from them in their development of citizenship preparedness; and third, through political discussion with others prominently present in adolescents everyday life, such school experiences could be added to and/or integrated with extra-school experiences such as news media use to affect their citizenship preparedness. Via multi-level modeling with political discussion as well as civic literacy and citizenship conception as the dependent variables, this paper obtained evidence in support of the key hypotheses. The paper discussed the implications of the results, especially in terms of the research agenda for revived political socialization research in the deliberative framework."
2009-0236,Civic Learning Online: A Framework for the Study of Civic Engagement Websites for Youth,Youth and Politics,,,,Paper,Civic Learning Online: A Framework for the Study of Civic Engagement Websites for Youth,Youth and Politics,"For many observers, the internet offers exciting possibilities for reconnecting young people with civic life. Several studies have analyzed civic websites designed for youth, but the field of civic learning online has so far lacked a theoretical framework for understanding the many civic websites now emerging. This article reviews the extensive research on civic education in schools, and uncovers four general categories of civic learning applicable to a range of contexts. Next, the article draws on recent work describing the uniqueness of young peoples civic, communicative, and learning styles, and expands the four learning categories to include more participatory and expressive learning opportunities than those usually available in schools. This expanded framework is applied to 90 of North Americas most-trafficked youth civic engagement websites. Results indicate that most sites present something like classroom civics offered online, though sites without offline connections offer a more diverse set of opportunities. We discuss ways to improve approaches to engaging young people through the internet."
2009-0237,Civic Life and Information Flows in Somaliland,Public Opinions and Information Ecologies: Assessing the Role of the Media in Conflict Environments,,,,Paper,Civic Life and Information Flows in Somaliland,Public Opinions and Information Ecologies: Assessing the Role of the Media in Conflict Environments,"The paper takes the case of Somaliland and addresses how information that supports the state and nation-building process flows and how it is challenged by religious extremism and vice versa. Drawing on data collected through social network analysis in four key cities, we argue that religious fundamentalism faces greater resistance as you move towards the west of the country because of the
nature of the social networks and the quality and quantity of information the population has access to.

Related to this, there are three elements that are particularly important including: the dynamics of civic life; the extent of government institutions; and the historical legacy and the proximity to the centre of Sufi religious education in Harar (Eastern Ethiopia). The paper will explore all three elements, but focusing on civil life in particular."
2009-0238,Civilization/Mediatization,"Mediatization as Keyword Between Civilization, Domestication, Authority, and Media Culture",,,,Paper,Civilization/Mediatization,"Mediatization as Keyword Between Civilization, Domestication, Authority, and Media Culture","In his civilization perspective on individual and society, Norbert Elias introduced the concept of figuration: the interrelationships in which people interact under conditions of interdependency and power, e.g. by division of labour in capitalism. In such figurations also the personality formation of the people develops by communication and self socialization. Civilization thus appears empirically as a process in which the basic interdependency chains are lengthening, and at the same time people internalize more and more self-constraints in order to control their emotions and to fulfil adequate norms.
On the other hand, mediatization means that media become relevant for more or less all interactions, emotions, social groups and self socializing processes of the people. Thus, civilization and mediatization are interlocking today, e.g. by media driven figurations and norms of communication. The presentation will elaborate this and present empirical evidence for the role of the media in the process of civilization."

It examines  theoretically and empirically  the limitations of free, unrestricted, online social interactions on civil society. Network analysis of 35 newsgroups on politics and philosophy over six years (2001-2006) revealed a power-law degree distribution, a highly unequal distribution of replies among discussion participants. Furthermore, the extent to which the distribution is skewed increased with size. The larger and more active a newsgroup, the more disproportionate the distribution of replies and the more unlikely most participants to attract attention to messages they posted. These patterns of communication work against some of the cornerstones of civil society: equality, informed citizenry and diversity of channels for associations."

More specifically, how can communication create enlightened and committed citizens who will contribute as voters, consumers, and employees working in organizations handle the severe political, economic, social and cultural changes that CO2 emissions and global warming will bring about? Organizations have a role in this key issue.

This paper concentrates on a delimited aspect of this very complex rhetorical situation by comparing the external corporate rhetoric produced by two industries which appear to be under pressure due to their CO2-heavy products or production processes. On the one hand, there is the car-making industry (production companies like Opel, Peugeot or Volkswagen) to whom pervasive climate communication is a rather new thing. On the other hand, there are the hotel and travel industries (hotel chains like Scandic or Best Western) that have more than fifteen years of excellence when it comes to working with environmental communication (Frandsen & Johansen, 2001a, 2001b).

How has the political and social debate about climate changes influenced the rhetoric of these two industries? What kind of new rhetorical devices do they use, from greenhushing to greenwashing and beyond? How trustworthy are they? Will these companies forever be doomed to appear as ""strategic"" and untrustworthy in their corporate communication about climate changes? Or can they be turned into social rhetors for the benefit of both companies and society at large? This paper explores these key issues and considers the role that discourse and dialogue play in this topic.

Less attention has been paid, though, to the ways in which dominant media restructuring is affecting grassroots and community public spheres. Has the decrease in media localism, for example, closed community groups out of news and policy making spheres? Or are groups able to counteract closures by taking advantage of web technologies? Are independent, alternative, or community media filling the void left by local news? In this presentation we discuss our ongoing case study of changes in the Bay Areas democratic communication flows. Drawing on a political economic analysis of Bay Area media ownership and format structures, and on interviews with 26 community groups, we discuss how local groups are negotiating the shrinking public sphere."
2009-0242,Cloud Control,"Personal Surveillance, Digitized Identity, and Control in National and Transnational Contexts",,,,Paper,Cloud Control,"Personal Surveillance, Digitized Identity, and Control in National and Transnational Contexts",The model of ubiquitous computing has recently undergone a conception and terminological transformation: so-called 'cloud computing' promises consumers always-on access to their data. The condition of ubiquitous access is submission to what might be described as the 'enclosure' of personal information: it must be transferred from devices controlled by the consumer to the server farms of commercial corporations who will in turn mine it for marketing data. This paper explores the forms of consumer surveillance and monitoring envisioned by the emerging model of cloud computing. It raises issues of both privacy and control over personal information and considers the ways in which commercial organizations have addressed these issues. It concludes with a theoretical model that treats entry into the 'cloud' as a productive form of exchange: consumers submit to productive monitoring in exchange for the offer of convenience and information access.
2009-0243,"Coactivation: An Examination on Subjective Feelings, Physiological Responses, and Adaptive Functions",Keywords in Information Systems: Emotion (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,"Coactivation: An Examination on Subjective Feelings, Physiological Responses, and Adaptive Functions",Keywords in Information Systems: Emotion (High Density),"People often experience mixed feelings. Underlying the mixed feelings is coactivation of aversive and appetitive motivational systems (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994; Cacioppo, Gardner, & Berntson, 1999). The conceptual development of coactivation can be retrieved back to more than half a century ago (e.g., Miller & Dollard, 1941) and many emotional and motivational theories allow a coactive state of their dual systems. A critical question is how this coactive state distinguishes itself from the reciprocal state (when activation of one system suppresses the other system) in terms of subjective feelings, physiological responses, and adaptive functions. Three studies are designed to explores this question."

The specific population of this study is rural Hispanics residing in the Southwestern United States. As with other demographic groups in the United States, this specific population is experiencing a surge in childhood obesity and diabetes among all age groups. This epidemic has serious ramifications for public health. Given that both rural and minority populations develop diabetes at a rate greater than the general population, it has been suggested that rural Hispanics are doubly disadvantaged. This study involved a secondary analysis of psychophysiological data collected in response to radio and television anti-diabetes public service announcements. Instances of code-switching  a switch from English to Spanish  are being analyzed as a possible attention-getting and emotion-driving structural feature. Furthermore, responses specific consequence statements are being analyzed in order to identify effective appeals. Sixty rural Hispanics in the Southwestern United States participated in the experiment."

In a study analysing all known instances of coercion against internet communication since then, the authorities in Singapore are found to have generally kept their promise of applying the law with a light touch: there have been no instances of censorship of political content online. However, the government has been prepared to use sweeping sedition and criminal defamation laws. While the commercial basis of licensed print and broadcast media have made them easier to regulate with a light touch, insurgents using online technologies are mostly voluntary, non-profit ventures, immune to financial pressures. Dissidents find themselves instead on the receiving end of strong government action. This tendency is double edged. While Singapores strong government is likely to prevail in any conflict, it will pay a political price when it resorts to less calibrated forms of coercion."
2009-0246,Cognitive and Attitudinal Effects of the News Frame and Group Cue on Processing News About Immigration,Cognitive Approaches to Framing,,,,Paper,Cognitive and Attitudinal Effects of the News Frame and Group Cue on Processing News About Immigration,Cognitive Approaches to Framing,"Content analysis studies have found negative treatment of immigration in the media, yet there is very scanty empirical research developed on effects of news frames about immigration. This work deals with this topic by conducting an experimental study in which 355 students in the University of Salamanca (Spain) participated. The news article used in the experiment mentioned information about the growing immigration in Spain highlighting, a) either positive (economic contribution frame) or negative (growth on delinquency frame) consequences, b) information about the origin of the immigrants, Latin Americans vs. Moroccans. Results showed that the type of stressed news frame in the report exerted significant cognitive and attitudinal effects. Moreover, an indirect effect of group cue was found in the dependent variables. These outcomes are discussed in relation with analysis of the underlying explanatory mechanisms for framing effect."
2009-0247,Cognitive and Emotional Processing of Music,Keywords in Information Systems: Emotion (High Density),,,,Paper,Cognitive and Emotional Processing of Music,Keywords in Information Systems: Emotion (High Density),"Music effects studies have shown that the structural features of music may elicit a variety of responses from listeners. Many such studies have used classical, foreign, or purposely created music that is unfamiliar and irrelevant to participants. The results of these studies are difficult to generalize to popular or commercially available music, leaving a gap in the wider body of music effects literature.
The current study was designed to examine the effects of music tempo and familiarity on listeners autonomic arousal (measured via skin conductance responses) and self-reported arousal and liking, specifically using alternative pop/rock music as a stimulus. Participants (N = 40) listened to 24 clips of alternative pop/rock music and gave evaluations of the music.
Results indicated that tempo moderately influenced listeners liking of the music but had little effect upon their perceptions of arousal. Familiarity, however, had a strong effect upon both self-reported arousal and liking. Interaction effects also occurred between tempo and familiarity for self-reported liking and autonomic arousal.
The results of the study show that familiarity with a stimulus may strongly influence both liking and arousal and that tempo may not influence arousal as much as once thought. This result is consistent with previous research that shows differences in several self-report measures between music of different genres."
2009-0248,Cognitive and Emotional Processing While Navigating CNN.com,Keywords in Information Systems: Attention (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,Cognitive and Emotional Processing While Navigating CNN.com,Keywords in Information Systems: Attention (High Density),"Twenty-two participants explored CNN.com while their on-screen activity was recorded and synchronize with physiological indicators of cognition and emotion. Screens were coded as either general navigation pages (i.e. CNN.com homepage) or target article pages. Preliminary results suggest that browsing general navigation screens in search of a target article yielded decreased heart rate, skin conductance, corrugator activation, and obicularis oculi activation. Once a specific target article had been reached, however, participants showed increased heart rate and corrugator activation, but relatively flat patterns of skin conductance and obicularis activation. This suggests that the process of browsing elicited the allocation of resources to perceptual encoding, while the observation of an acquired target article elicited the allocation of resources to cognitive elaboration. Furthermore, general motivational activation and emotional experience during browsing appeared to be diminished relative to that which took place while participants viewed a specific target article."

The few studies that have been conducted to date on inter-organizational communication among anti-trafficking actors call for greater collaboration between them within communities and between the local, national, and international levels. However, no baseline of collaboration within the anti-trafficking movement has been established yet . To advance understanding of collaboration attempts online, this paper presents findings from analyses of textual references to collaborative and/or multi-level anti-trafficking efforts on the websites of 150 anti-trafficking organizations worldwide. These findings are then compared with results from an analysis of the hyperlinks between these websites, to explore whether and how organizational reports of collaboration correspond with linking patterns. The paper illuminates the types of actors that collaborate (or not), the forms of collaboration they report, and the prevalence of collaboration across operational levels and geographical regions."

As information about the conflict in Burma spread through international media, some Buddhist individuals and organizations used the Web as a space for networking Buddhist practitioners to religious and nonreligious activism opportunities and for framing the monastic protests according to Buddhist historical and ethical narratives. This study presents an in-depth textual and content analysis of seventeen message threads on a transnational Buddhist Web forum posted between August and November of 2007. My analysis points to the extensive use of hyperlinks and external Web content as an important vehicle for a) the mobilization of forum members to collaborate with religious and nonreligious movement organizations, and b) a rhetorical device for constructing religious narratives that framed monastic activism as either a religious duty or a profane sacrilege."

The Weick school of organizational sensemaking suggests the fuzzy situation of strategic innovation as a classic example of an occasion for sensemaking. People engage questions such as: How should we redesign our company and its services for an uncertain future? This creates a situation of high positive stress, where people bring their matters of concern, their historical repertoires, personal and organizational values, desires and deeply-held beliefs to the situation. This opens the possibility for new types of dialogue, mediated by creative problem identification, ideation, and visual representation. The project reported here applies SMM to research aimed at understanding patterns of engagement in collaborative foresight, and effective dialogue in general."

The data shows three college students brainstorming for a group project, the production of a short film for a class. Employing various modalities, the participants accept or reject each others proposals, elaborate upon them, and combine them into complex wholes. Gestures make idea-construction a thoroughly public process. By repeating and building upon one anothers gestures (or components thereof) the participants embody collaborative thought processes. This study thus exhibits some of the roles of repetitive gestures during the brainstorming stage of a meeting. The reuse of previously produced gestures connects sequences of talk (LeBaron & Koschmann, 2003), shows shared understanding of what the gesture represents, or indicates acceptance of proposals. Gesture, a social public practice, embodies the process of formation of shared imagination and enables participants to achieve mutual agreement of the ideas that they co-construct."

No other identified method offers the same advantages as Sense-Making Methodology and its Micro-Moment Time-Line interview. The approach is easy to learn and apply. It can document each need based on specific interviews and provide details that make it possible to evaluate the importance of each need. Further, it facilitates creative work and the invention of new features. This is in particular demonstrated through the work of eighteen students who were given the task of defining requirements for a new e-learning system."

College men in Singapore reported that idealized body images, as portrayed in magazine ads, had greater media effects on female friends than on the self. Their perception of media effects on the self was positively associated with their body dissatisfaction and their intention to engage in body-image behavior. The sum of perceived effects on the self and on male friends accounted for college mens body dissatisfaction and their intention to lose weight, whereas the third-person differential between the self and female friends was negatively associated with the college mens intention to go on a diet."

Five different motives for using SNS were identified: time-passing entertainment, information, relationship development, relationship maintenance, and trend-following. Endorsement of the time-passing entertainment motive was associated with overall time spent on SNS. Extraversion was associated with time spent on the sites and with endorsement of the relationship maintenance and time-passing entertainment motives. Neuroticism was associated with time spent on the sites and with endorsement of the time-passing entertainment and trend-following motives. There were significant interactions between the two personality traits in relation to the information and relationship development motives. Neuroticism was associated within greater endorsement of the relationship development and information motives, but only among those who were also low in extraversion."

First- and Second-Level Media Agendas of Multilanguage Web Sites,"Pathways to Political Communication: Selectivity, Effects, and Statistics","The study compared two versions (Arabic and English) of two multi-language Web sites, CNN and Al-Jazeera, seeking an understanding of how news organizations adapt to different cultural settings by changing the parameters that shape their agendas.

The study found that Web sites targeting similar audiences correlated in terms of the first-level agenda  topics that are of interest to their common target audience. However, each edition  Arabic or English  of each Web site  CNN or Al-Jazeera reflected the political stance, cultural values and norms of the country of its origin regardless of the audience it was targeting. These differences were detected on the second-level agenda: prominence given to a story, affective tone, and frames used in a story. Thus, as a news organization attempted to adapt to a cultural setting other than its own by domesticating or localizing its agenda to its specialized target audience by addressing topics of interest to them, it still preserved its cultural and ideological identity through the attributes of these topics."

The purpose of this multi-disciplinary study is to test previous research (e.g. Hoeffler and Keller, 2002) which asserts there is a linkage between an organizations CSR emphasis in its communications efforts and the organizations perceived brand sincerity. The results of this study indicate that the Chipotle brand community perceives sincerity to be the most salient dimension of Chipotles brand personality, followed by the dimensions of excitement and competence. This study also found that Chipotles public relations and CSR efforts specifically incorporate: 1) media relations, 2) online engagement, 3) local events and promotions and 4) sponsorships. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."

Under the coordination of the WHO, the SARS outbreak was contained globally in less than four months in 2003. Given that there was no biomedical solution against SARS, WHOs global communication and other non-medical measures played a critical role in the swift containment of the outbreak. This study investigates the symbolically dimension of WHOs SARS communication through a discourse analysis of the organizations website. The findings suggest that WHO was able to exert considerable power over nation states through its utilization of information technologies and strategic approach to communicating with the global public during SARS. WHO also faced major communicative predicaments and challenges as its institutional role was being redefined to reflect the changing dynamics of international politics and economy under the forces of globalization. The implications of these findings to WHOs future communication response to global outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are discussed."

I will then examine challenges related to the translation of quantitative research results to non-academic audiences: correcting the tendency to infer causal relationships from correlational evidence; explaining the difference between statistical and practical significance; and addressing researchers own concerns that their work will be misrepresented by journalists. The presentation will conclude with a discussion about whether the selection of research questions in our field should be guided, at least in part, by how the results will affect and be interpreted by parents and the media."

We seem to have dozens, no, dozens too many, subsets, and little common core or language or history. We come from psychology, philosophy, journalism, the arts, social science, theater, rhetoric, new emerging technologies, law, the Chicago school, European critical studies, the entertainment industry and business schools, and so on. We use different languages and have different interests. One researchers proof is anothers folly. We fight for turf, space and time. Newcomers face the tension of whether or how to fit in with the established order or to contribute in their own unique way.

This cacophony mirrors the energy and unique perspectives of urban communication. Cities are about communication. The crowded and turbulent conditions and ever-shifting array of players require constant negotiation, complex if often unstated rules, and ongoing refinement. Communication technologies and networks, which often start and are based in cities, alter everything about communication.

This paper looks at the growing complexity of the field of communication and suggests lessons the discipline might learn from the best of urban communication."

One cannot only look at the political policies that established colonization, but also look at the various communities of practice aiding the legitimization and ideological construction of the American occupation of the Philippines. In this paper, I intend to discuss one community of practice: the stereograph card industry, a communicative medium used to photograph the Philippines as a new colonial possession for American consumption. More linguistically specific, I will focus on the overlooked printed text that accompanied the stereograph images. The printed text can naively be considered as primarily informational practices to complement the images. I believe this limited view does not give enough attention to the multidimensional meanings and agency of the text, therefore deserving a more nuanced and systematic study. The type of study that I feel is needed for this textual relationship to the Philippine colonization, is a social historical and cultural genealogical study of the printed text on back of the stereographs.

***I could not download the digital stereograph images in the Appendix, but if my paper is accepted, I can provide digital images upon presentation time and full paper submittal."

According to Saussure (1974, 1983), the making of meanings is closely related to the production and interpretation of signs. All kinds of communication, including advertising design, are about meaning-making. This study aims at examining the effectiveness of a problem-based learning (PBL) approach in enhancing student designers creative flexibility in advertising design. Hand-sketched print advertisements (sketches) produced by participants on a series of PBL workshops (experimental group) and those on another series of lecture-based workshops (control group) for a bakery promoting a metaphorical theme Bread is Life are examined with a semiotic approach. The visual representations realised through the sketches in association with the metaphor are categorised into different signifiers by five experienced art directors and compared on an inter-group basis. Results of the analysis shows that the experimental group has generated a wider variety of signifiers than the control group, reflecting a higher degree of creative flexibility resulted from the use of a PBL approach. Theoretically, the empirical study addresses a number of conceptual issues in advertising design, creativity, problem solving, divergent thinking, and semiotics. Practically, it contributes to the understanding of how a PBL approach may contribute to the enhancement of semiotic association skills among student designers in a professional communication context."

I suggest that this perspective is weakened by its reliance on what Ulrich Beck (2005) calls methodological nationalism, and its close cousin the realist view in international relations theory. Subsequent sections carve out a revised research agenda that draws insights from the circuits of culture and globalization of news approaches en route to developing the perspective proposed here. I bring these perspectives into discussion with one another by examining: (1) scholarly views at the turn-of-the-20th century that stressed the dynamic interplay between internationalism and imperialism and the double-character of increasing interdependence; (2) the cosmopolitan character of the global media industries, (3) the cartels that cut across national lines and defined the global media system, (4) the role played by the global media in the New York and South American financial crises of 1873 and 1874 and (5) South America as a kind of litmus test for determining whether the relationship between global and local media markets are best understood through the struggle for control or the globalization of control models that are compared and contrasted throughout this paper."

Specifically, it is argued that isolationist attitudes lead to selective avoidance of international news, which leads to effects on foreign policy opinions above and beyond the effect of isolationism alone. Furthermore, the effects of framing the intervention in cooperative versus militant terms are explored. Secondary analysis of the Pew Center for the People and the Press December 2006 News Interest Index Survey demonstrated that in the context of evaluations of the Iraq war and willingness to engage in Darfur, isolationist attitudes affected opinions through avoidance of news media. Additionally, framing of the intervention influenced the process by which individuals evaluated an intervention. Furthermore, it was found that the framing effects were moderated by party identification. Implications for research and practice are discussed."
2009-0265,"""Communication"" and ""Media"" as ""Clustering"" Keywords in Raymond Williams",Theme Poster Session,,,,Paper,"""Communication"" and ""Media"" as ""Clustering"" Keywords in Raymond Williams",Theme Poster Session,"Williamss keywords are not carefully mapped individual words that were then casually cross-referenced. Rather, he routinely located each keyword within the interplay of sets of words constituting what he called clusters. The clusters in turn were seen by him as something like Bourdieuian fields. That is, the semantic interplay within clusters suggested the contours of the extra-textual social forces at stake in their semantic contestations. The clusters lead us from those vocabulary entries in Keywords to Williamss broader analyses. For example the classic cluster that inspired Culture and Society, within which the first published version of Keywords was originally planned to be included as an appendix in 1958, was culture/art/industry/culture/democracy/class. Put more linearly, the cluster opened the books thematic motif of the fate of aesthetico-cultural reflection in the context of the reconstitution of a social order by economic, democratic and industrial change.

This paper briefly maps this more complex keyword strategys emergence and then applies it to the cases of communication and media within Williamss work . Both are found to turn on a tension between instrumental and normative meanings. Both are 'resolved' for Williams by resort to his own alternative to 'media', 'means of communication'. Finally, the paper will skeletally develop some implications of these cases for broader practice in communication studies."

For answering this question the work of Goffman (1971, 1980, 1982, 2002) on frames and interaction strategies as well as the concept of mediatization developed by Krotz (2001, 2007) will be used as a theoretical framework.
The presentation will strongly centre on the empirical basis of the study. Observations were conducted in the metro, trains, buses and trams. Furthermore mobility dairies and problem-centred interviews were used. The study was carried out in Erfurt, Berlin and Madrid and uses the method of qualitative heuristics by Kleining (1994, 1995). The findings show that people claim a certain territory and embellish it according to their needs during the time of their travel and media communication."

It is to demote the giant task of understanding how we communicate to the status of a somewhat troublesome and irrelevant problem. Furthermore, a focus on effects implies the study of a measureable difference in a variable over a relatively short, arbitrary time point. Why define and limit the enterprise of communication research to predicting an effect rather than understanding the dynamic processes of communication?
Lets stop making the study of communication simple by stopping time in order to measure an effect and instead lets embrace the complexity of communication as a central part of a dynamically complex system."

Through an analysis of a mail panel survey conducted among a representative group of U.S. adults (N=13,260), we examined differences in self-efficacy, health information channel use, and doctor dependence across social groups, i.e., education, ethnicity, and geographic locations. Lower education groups, Hispanic respondents, and rural residents displayed lower self-efficacy compared to their reference groups. Self-efficacy for health information was positively related to Internet use and contacts with a health care provider, and was negatively related to using newspapers, television, family, friends, and religious groups for health information. Education, ethnicity, and self-efficacy affected the degree of doctor dependence."

Given that coping is best understood in a defined context, we examine how 40 Army wives, whose husbands deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan between 2003 and 2005, communicatively managed stress before, during, and after the deployment. We used the Retrospective Interview Technique to solicit their recollections of the deployment process, resulting in over 1500 pages of interview transcripts. Analysis of the data revealed 559 coping tactics that were categorized into seven coping strategies: seeking social support, giving support, focusing on the problem, focusing on the relationship, avoidance, managing information, and releasing emotions. The results demonstrate that many of these coping strategies have unintended consequences, often as a result of the interdependent nature of close relationships."

The research reported here analyzes policies related to identifiability and anonymity of users from state governments in the U.S. In addition to the substantial attention policies give to the somewhat related topics of privacy and confidentiality, this analysis reveals other themes linked to identification of personal information, use of names/passwords, anonymity, and signing of documents. The findings suggest a set of tensions revealed in these policy messagesillustrating some of the complexity related to organizational policy efforts in this area. The paper draws several conclusions, notes implications for theory and practice, and suggests directions for continued work in this area."

This is the first study to directly examine each interaction in the beginning stages of relationships and the communication changes that occur in that process. Individuals completed a modified version of the Iowa Communication Record for all of their interactions with a new acquaintance for about ten weeks. Hypotheses predicted positive associations between perceptions of communication qualities and communication quantity and communication satisfaction. Perceived positive talk impact was also expected to be positively associated with communication satisfaction. All hypotheses were supported. Research questions examined communication qualities and communication quantity as predictors of communication satisfaction and talk impact. Communication qualities as predictors of communication satisfaction during each encounter in newly developing relationships were also investigated. The results provided strong support for the fundamental proposition in many theories of relational development about communication changes as relationships evolve.

Confirmation was conceptualized here as the combination of acceptance and challenge. 413 participants (ages 18-66) completed a survey assessing their diet and exercise behaviors as well as interactions with a significant other about weight management. Specific messages were assessed to determine the types of messages individuals receive from their significant others and how they vary in acceptance and challenge. Acceptance and challenge were also assessed more generally across interactions, and as predicted, the combination of acceptance and challenge from significant others was related to the highest levels of body self-esteem, eating and exercise self-efficacy, and healthy eating behaviors."
2009-0275,Communitarianism and Cultural Studies: A Strategic Connection,The Politics of Researching Culture,,,,Paper,Communitarianism and Cultural Studies: A Strategic Connection,The Politics of Researching Culture,"This paper advocates that the fragmentation wrought by conflicting discourses on difference within Cultural Studies may be best negotiated through a communitarian, rather than liberal, approach. By emphasising a deconstructive notion of difference that excludes intersubjectivity, contemporary identity politics ignore the value of a shared tradition. The conflict between communitarian and liberal approaches is often presented as solvable through dialogical consensus. Based on the habermasian ideal of communicative rationality, dialogical consensus presupposes the existence of transcendental, non-contextually specific universal norms of validity which may be interpreted as privileging the universality of the law over the singularity of the personal, thus ultimately sacrificing freedom to equality. Rather than focussing on the universality of truth, justice and morality so as to lay down the basis for political consensus between different parties, a gramscian communitarianism points towards the cultural manifestations of truth, justice and morality as forms through which hegemony perpetuates itself, namely, through a contextually based selective tradition that is constantly being redefined. Because the survival of community hinges on the capacity to continuously adapt to new consensus, communitarianism negotiates the particular within the context of strategic essentialism, appropriating universal categories based on a situational specificity. This recourse to strategic essentialism can be witnessed in the attempt to implement a transnational Cultural Studies that transcends a British scope, integrating issues centring on difference."

This study examines CBPR in a university-based research center conducting health promotion and disease prevention research in Indian Country. This paper reviews the tensions between CBPR ideologies, its practical application in Indian Country, and the impact of this theory/practice dialectic on the ability to conduct health promotion and disease prevention research. And it concludes that far from empowering individuals and communities, status quo research in Indian Country perpetuates a type of clientism that reinforces researcher/researched relationships."

From this perspective I hope to identify and explore what I think of with only some awkwardness as the non-media side of community media. I consider ways in which community has been understood and constructed in arts and media movements concerned with a progressive social change agenda in Britain since the counterculture of the 1960s and early 1970s. I am not so concerned with community media as a contemporary practice and form of organisation of media production and consumption, rather I am interested in viewing it in relation to other forms of cultural and countercultural work which have been (or claimed to be) located in the community."

Comparative media analysis tends to draw on a most similar systems design (MSSD) and suffers from the problems of overestimation of the importance of the independent variable, unrealistic claims about the constancy of other variables, and a lack of flexibility in extending comparative work beyond similar societies. Most different systems design, the most common alternative to MSSD, also has methodological problems. This means that comparative media analysis is not very good at explaining why we have the media we have and will not be very good at explaining until we adopt different comparative methods. Fuzzy set theory, developed first in mathematics but then extended to social sciences, can help us address these problems. Fuzzy set designs have been used in recent years in comparative small-n sociology, social policy, history, and political analysis but not in media analysis. Fuzzy sets may also help us overcome unfortunate quantitative and qualitative methodological divides that continue to dog media analysis. This paper will review some recent comparative media analysis highlighting the problems with method; discuss the development of fuzzy set methods in social sciences; illustrate how it may be used in comparative media analysis and why it is better than existing methods."
2009-0279,"Comparative Study of the Communications Law and Policy Reforms in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China",Liberalization and Policy Reform: International Perspectives,,,,Paper,"Comparative Study of the Communications Law and Policy Reforms in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China",Liberalization and Policy Reform: International Perspectives,"On 11th March 2008, China announced a radical reform of its ministries. The Ministry of Information Industry (MII), the existing telecommunications regulator, will be merged into the new Ministry of Industry and Information. Two years ago, Taiwan and Hong Kong reformed their communications law and policy in the direction of a unified regulator. In 2006, Taiwan established a unified regulator called National Communications Commission while Hong Kong announced a merger of the telecommunications and broadcasting regulators into a unified Communications Authority.

By adopting such methodologies as literature review and documentary analysis, the authors examine three research questions in this paper: firstly, how does the Greater China Area respond to the phenomenon of technological convergence in their communications laws and policies? Secondly, has regulatory harmonization occurred in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China? Thirdly, why have these three Chinese jurisdictions remained different in their communications laws and policies?

In this paper, the authors argue that these three Chinese jurisdictions have all moved, to a different degree, towards a more unified model of communications regulation in response to the development of technological convergence. However, the convergence phenomenon has not led to an identical model of communications law and policy in these three places. The regulatory reforms undertaken in these three Chinese jurisdictions also demonstrate that few countries or cities integrating into the global economy can be immune from the impact of technological convergence and global competition of information economy."

With high digital advancement and mobile phone penetration, mobile TV players in Singapore and Taiwan are having broadcasting mobile TV market trials and some 3G services without decisive commercialized plans and policies. This study interviewed stakeholders, like industrial players (telcos, broadcasters, content/services aggregators) and regulators, and took a social-technical framework to examine mobile TVs technological, market, and policy subsystems in Singapore and Taiwan. The findings elaborated mobile TV ecology in two national contexts, and compared key issues in technologies, market trials and business models, and proposed regulatory frameworks."

Desensitization to disaster films was compared to desensitization to fictional violence in an experiment in which 324 undergraduates were exposed to either an hour of disaster, fictional violence, or non-violent (control) footage. Afterwards, all participants saw a brief news video about tornadoes and were asked about compassion and their willingness to donate money and volunteer to help disaster victims. The findings were mixed: participants in the disaster condition showed reductions in fearfulness and donated less money than participants in other groups, yet felt more compassion toward the disaster victims in the dependent variable scenario. Desensitization both to fictional and nonfictional violence was correlated with decreased compassion and willingness to help victims."

Experiment 1 suggests that in upward comparisons CSP is not constrained to areas unrelated to an original comparative topic, rather it is broadened to include areas both related and unrelated to the initial domain. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that participants in a typical CSP design (negative feedback) restricted CSP to unrelated areas, mirroring the typical pattern found in prior CSP studies. In contrast, upward comparison participants exhibited CSP equally across both related and unrelated areas. These findings extend prior research by showing that upward comparisons not only increased CSP, but importantly motivated people to extend such efforts beyond the cautious pattern typically found in prior CSP studies."

This research tests a synthesis of Walthers (1992) social information processing theory and Chaikens (1980, 1987) heuristic-systematic model. An experiment examines the effect of exposure to two heuristic cues, email domain and expertise disclosures, on participants judgments of a senders credibility and their attitudes toward a message topic. Greater exposure to heuristic cues influenced participants judgments of a senders credibility. The relationship between exposure to heuristic cues and topical attitude judgments was mediated by participants judgments of a sources credibility. While measures of heuristic processing did not increase as participants were exposed to more heuristic cues, exposure to heuristic cues impacted the amount of systematic message processing, suggesting new considerations about the use of thought-listing in the assessment of persuasive message processing."

Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) is used as a basis for the proposed Concern as Motivation for Protection (CMP) model, which suggests that self-efficacy, response efficacy and level of concern influence protective behavioral intentions in distinct ways. Results from regression analyses indicate that self-efficacy, response efficacy, and mothers concern are significant predictors of intentions to engage in preventive behaviors with daughters. Additionally, a content analysis of mothers open-ended reasons for their concern about their daughters breast cancer risk reveals trends that vary by concern level and specific comment valence. Campaign implications are discussed and directions for future research are presented."

Based on the premise that politicians develop a more or less professional approach to getting their message into the media, we investigate the perception of action repertoires and their success in the view of politicians and media advisors on the one hand and the view of journalists on the other hand. We aim to discuss the critical link in the interaction between politicians as information sources and journalists as gatekeeper to the public. We hypothesize that the culture of interaction between media and politics is characterized here by discrepancies and conflicts regarding the perception of power and how this translates into specific action repertoires. By taking a comparative view, we expect to find national differences in the concurrence of orientations between politicians and journalists that are rooted in national political cultures. Empirically, our paper is based on a survey of about 1500 politicians and journalists in seven Western European countries which represent different political communication systems. We investigate how national political communication cultures vary in terms of their conflicts over strategic communication."
2009-0288,Conflict Avoidance: A Functional Analysis,Theoretical Advances in Disclosure and Avoidance Decisions,,,,Paper,Conflict Avoidance: A Functional Analysis,Theoretical Advances in Disclosure and Avoidance Decisions,"Scholars have long held that conflict is a ubiquitous feature of social interaction (e.g., Dahrendorf, 1958); yet individuals report that verbal conflict or arguing is relatively rare. College student diaries indicate that they average about seven arguments per week, typically with peers, that on average only last three minutes (Benoit & Benoit, 1987). Generally, spouses report having one argument per month (Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler, & Wethington, 1989) and about half of spouses report having less than one argument per month (McGonagle, Kessler, & Schilling, 1992). Finally, transcripts of the daily conversations of romantic partners indicate that less than one percent of interactions involve conflict while seventy-five percent are focused on descriptions of daily activities, random observations about the current environment, the activities of other people and television programs (Alberts, Yoshimura, Rabby, & Loschiavo, 2005).
The relative paucity of arguing should not be viewed as a sign of relational harmony. Indeed, relational partners often irritate each other on a daily basis. Studies have shown that forty-four percent of people are irritated by a relational partner each day and that young adults report irritations in their romantic relationships an average of 8.7 times per week (Miller, 1997). Moreover, Kirchler (1988) studied diaries of daily events occurring over a four- week span and found that happily married individuals reported feeling bad twenty-four percent of the time because of something their spouse did, while unhappily married individuals reported experiencing the same negativity forty-three percent of the time. Although arguing is infrequent, the emotional reactions, such as anger, annoyance, and displeasure, that can underlie conflict situations are not. Hence, there is ample evidence of discord in close relationships other than that of arguing.
Conflict avoidance is used as a management strategy in a variety of relationships and may be the predominant style employed by some individuals in some relationships (Roloff & Ifert, 2000). Although conflict avoidance is recognized as common and is, in some cases, considered a functional form of conflict management, its research is very diverse. Indeed, there are a variety of topics under study and many different theories used to guide conflict avoidance research. Although this diversity can be useful and demonstrates the complexity of conflict avoidance, the absence of a larger theoretical framework to explain it renders this research area somewhat incoherent. The purpose of this manuscript is to propose an approach to conflict avoidance that employs a larger framework. Using a functional framework to cast conflict avoidance, we will explicate the construct of conflict avoidance, frame it within a functional approach and highlight the implications of our analysis."

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to explore and understand the face-negotiation strategies disabled college students use to maintain their own face and the face of able body individuals through the use of face negotiation theory. Although this theory explains how people from individualistic and collective cultures see themselves and others, and how these views affect peoples actions in conflict situations, in this paper we argue that people with disabilities represent a culture on its own. Our intention was to demonstrate the significance of this theory for understanding how people with disabilities handle facework during conflict situations with able bodied individuals. One focus group with 6 students and three in-depth interviews were conducted with students with varied physical disabilities. Results show this small representation of the disabled community on campus pointed out characteristics of both individualist and collectivist cultures in the way face strategies were used to handle conflict situations within their family and on campus."

Specifically, it analyzed 533 press releases, 433 news articles, and 47 daily Congressional calendars of business. Significant correlations were found supporting traditional agenda-building linkages between Congressional communications and media coverage; whereas no relationships were found between issue or attribute salience in news releases and actual Congressional activities. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed."

That situation challenged journalists trying to offer a cohesive narrative of the campaign. This paper argues that when faced with unfamiliar situations, journalists turn to familiar stories drawn from collective memory and mythical narrative to facilitate news that is resonant to their culture and their media audiences.

This paper presents the results of a qualitative textual analysis of American news and editorials about the Obama presidential campaign to explore the role of collective memory and mythical narrative in covering that candidate.

In the case of Obamas campaign, the candidate himself introduced collective memory of endearing past presidents Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Although journalists could have rejected those comparisons  as was the case for vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle  the feel-good memory of those past leaders and the irony of the comparisons made them journalistically useful. In addition, when Obamas acceptance speech ironically coincided with an anniversary of Martin Luther Kings historic I Have A Dream speech, journalists introduced the racial element of collective memory that Obama himself had avoided.

In all, the study found that although collective memory served as a useful guide for journalists, mythical narratives played a more subtle role because of the inevitable comparisons to those American leaders and the sacrificial hero narrative that their lives mirrored."

Specifically, we examine the specific ways in which students are using Facebook to interact with others on campus, ranging from complete strangers to friends. Using data from a survey of X University undergraduates (N=481) fielded in April 2007, we find three distinct suites of Facebook-related communication behavior: Initiating, Maintaining, and Information-Seeking, and that only Information-Seeking behavior predicts perceived bridging social capital. We argue that the technical and social affordances of SNSs enable relationships to form by serving some of the same functions typically performed by face-to-face communication among those who interact with one another within shared physical spaces."

Participants believed that their feminine work styles gave them a female advantage in the workplace but also related ways they experienced discrimination and struggled for credibility. Although overt masculine bias in the sports-related workplace is a factor in the struggles of these women for legitimacy, the authors also suggest that the friendliness trap is an alluring-yet-powerful barrier to advancement. The authors suggest that Fröhlichs concept be applied to research on women in a range of communication professions."

Internet-fueled social movements had also gained considerable momentum at the anti-corporate globalization movement in Seattle in 1999, which demonstrated an innovative pattern of transnational movements. The Zapatistas and the Seattle protests, however, are but two examples of the various kinds of Internet activism emerging at local, national and global levels: hacktivism, the alternative media movement, the anti-corporate globalization movement, the global anti-war movement, cyber-electioneering, minority-community construction, and other interactive forms of Internet media, including blogs and wikipedia. This study aims to suggest a preliminary conceptual map of Internet activism. It reviews literature that draws upon definition and characteristics of Internet activism, beginning with a debate on the political impact of new media technologies. It also discusses collective action and social movement theories from different perspectives. Classifying and synthesizing new trends of Internet-based activism, this study outlines three major domains of Internet activism: the use of the Internet as (1) a mobilizing tool, (2) a site of virtual struggles, and (3) a discursive space for alternative knowledge production."

We extend TMS research to mass communication effects research, specifically by applying it to the context of mass media and social change, the primary purview of entertainment-education (EE). We argue that  by moving TMS theory back into the social realm, and from the field of organizational communication to that of mass media effects  this theory may be able to clarify how the media can facilitate community-level social change through interaction with knowledge systems within those communities. Beyond providing a better understanding of the underlying theoretical processes by which knowledge is processed, stored, and shared in communities, the theory of TMS may be able to improve the ability of EE practitioners to target, tap into, and alter shared knowledge related to desired social change."
2009-0296,Constructing Public Relations as a Gendered Profession,New Frontiers of Public Relations Theory Development,,,,Paper,Constructing Public Relations as a Gendered Profession,New Frontiers of Public Relations Theory Development,"This study explores whether public relations is considered a profession in Russia. The goal is to expand understanding of what constitutes the public relations profession through a qualitative analysis of work-centered discourses of practitioners. The results demonstrated that public relations in Russia is often seen as a womans work due to historical, socio-economic, and societal particularities as well as pre-conceived notions about public relations. This study contributes to a theoretically new understanding of public relations as a socially constructed gendered profession to demonstrate how construction of the profession can both propel and slow down the development of the field."

How have recent interventionists in Romania understood their audiences? How might those conceptualizations relate to larger political dynamics in Europe? The present study concerns contemporary health communication projects implemented in what some call a developing Eastern Europe and funded by the European Union, United States, and Western non-profits. We specifically examine four examples of discourse from health communication efforts that involve a group historically conceived as problematic: The Romanian Roma. Focusing on how practitioners conceptualized audiences in each case as entities to be communicated with and about  ostensibly in order to affect their behavior  provides insight regarding health communication as a political endeavor, as well as insight regarding the current institutionalization of cultural and ethnic difference in Romania. Analysis suggests cause for concern and yet also evidence of progressive thinking."

The growing demand for multicultural women, their cultural labor and their lived stories is contextualized in this paper within the tumult of a decade defined by increasing tensions about immigration and associated changes in demographics, both of which are often perceived as threats to established definitions of U.S. citizenship and nation. Examining the tension between the cultural industries demands for ethnic female sexuality and the continuing backlash against ethnic and racial minority women, I theorize the position of Latina bodies in the mainstream media landscape as both culturally desirable and socially contested. Thus, the following questions guide the arguments of this paper: What is desirable and consumable about U.S. Latinas during the millennial era? Under what representational conditions are Latinas socially acceptable, dangerous or transformative to specific audiences? And what are the limits, possibilities and consequences of Latinas contemporary global marketability?"
2009-0299,"Consumption as Communication: A View From the Shopping Malls of San Salvador, El Salvador",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,"Consumption as Communication: A View From the Shopping Malls of San Salvador, El Salvador",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Poster Session,"This paper analyzes the presence of the shopping mall and consumer cultures in post-war El Salvador as a significant site of imaginaries of citizenship in the context of global flows. I base my analysis on ethnographic observations in three shopping malls in San Salvador, in addition to observations of street vendors in the downtown area of this city. Although public in character, the shopping mall is a private space that reproduces ideas of economic inequality and disparate access to goods. The mall can supply a lifestyleeverything from secure parking lots and identification with fashionable global brands, to culture in its multiple formsfor those who can afford to be its citizens. Even as the mall intends to eliminate the consumers need to confront the reality of the street, the street continues to be an important site where the economic and political importance of consumption is realized for many Salvadorans who are excluded from the formal sector. As shopping malls have grown in number and size, the informal sector in San Salvador, and the average Salvadoran familys dependence on remittances from abroad, have also expanded. These spaces are involved in a dialogue about the processes and consequences of consumption in contemporary Salvadoran societythe mall and the street communicate and link even as they differentiate."
2009-0300,Contested Cultural Concepts: Discursive Resources for Oppositional Membering in Public Talk,tudies in Cultural Meanings and Identities,,,,Paper,Contested Cultural Concepts: Discursive Resources for Oppositional Membering in Public Talk,Studies in Cultural Meanings and Identities,"The present study is concerned with an ethnographic approach to contested cultural concepts. It asks: What is the communicative function of the use of contested concepts in public talk? What kind of communicative work does their use achieve? The study locates the meaning of culturally contested concepts in their contested use, and it identifies oppositional membering as the chief purpose of that use. I invoke Gallies (1956) framework for the study of essentially contested concepts to perform the comparative analysis of four contested concepts from three speech communities (putting it in writing, talking it through, free speech, and dugri). In the course of the comparative analysis of these concepts I demonstrate the utility of Gallies framework and suggest the reconsideration of some of its elements. The study also introduces the semantic category of diasemy to capture the inevitable link between the meaning and social consequentiality of the use of contested cultural concepts."
2009-0301,Contextualizing Research on the Health of the Lebanese Elderly,Lost in Translation: Cultural Cues and the Challenges of Research in Intercultural Contexts,,,,Paper,Contextualizing Research on the Health of the Lebanese Elderly,Lost in Translation: Cultural Cues and the Challenges of Research in Intercultural Contexts,"This project interrogated the interpretations of health as constructed by female Lebanese elders. The research entailed informal focus group sessions and multiple in-depth interviews during a six-week study. Data was collected in Arabic (the mother tongue of the participants), transcribed, and then translated into English. The main themes emerging included health as a God's gift, tensions between trust and doubt in modern medicine, and obstructing structures to health management. Translation proved to be a huge challenge due to the contextual cultural meanings of key terms. The Lebanese dialect embodies a certain ritual of asking questions and answering them. This ritual when translated to English loses its cultural roots and thus might be interpreted erroneously. The author proposes conducting research in the mother tongue of the host culture, transcribing the data, and analyzing them with the results being translated."

At one end of the spectrum, technology may be the conduit through which information or communication traverses, and scholarship on technology may not consider any manner in which technology properties modify or illuminate the communication processes. At the other end, technology may be taken to be such a determining factor, that no other aspects of communication or communicators are considered in defining technology effects. This presentation will examine these and other manners in which communication technology research conceptualizes technology, and the benefits and detriments of consensus-seeking with regard to the well-being of the association."
2009-0303,Control Ergo Cogito: An Experimental Investigation of the Interactivity-as-Information Control Perspective,Keywords in Information Systems: Interactivity (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,Control Ergo Cogito: An Experimental Investigation of the Interactivity-as-Information Control Perspective,Keywords in Information Systems: Interactivity (High Density),"Experimental studies of interactivity in Web-based communication research have consistently shown that, contrary to expectations, high levels of interactivity are detrimental to information processing of online content. Such findings have led to speculations about too much interactivity being inimical in Websites as it imposes cognitive constraints on processing. In the current investigation, we argue that such proclamations are somewhat unfounded as most existing operationalizations of interactivity in experimental research have largely ignored the perspective of information control. We report preliminary results from an ongoing, three-condition, between-subjects experiment (N = 78, of whom 54 have completed participation) that manipulates interactivity according to principles of information control (low, medium, and high levels). Preliminary results suggest that participants favor (in terms of both cognition and affect) Web-based information when they are offered a high level of control while navigating through the information, relative to participants with moderate or low levels of information control."
2009-0304,Convergence and Diversity of Online News,Communication and Technology (CAT) Poster Session,,,,Paper,Convergence and Diversity of Online News,Communication and Technology (CAT) Poster Session,"This study examines two questions. First, do major online newspapers stories converge on issue agendas at the abstract level? Second, are stories diversified at the specific level? As intermedia agenda-setting theory predicts, issue agendas are significantly correlated among major online newspapers. Content uniqueness and news value significantly predict the diversity of news in the online newspapers. But content change and local orientation do not predict the diversity. Implications are discussed."

The findings indicated that the terms searched by Korean people are significantly different from those searched by people in other superstuructural societies in terms of political freedom (politically free, partially free, and not free), socio-economic status (high, medium, and low SES), and cultural differences (masculine, mixed/neutral, and feminine)."

This research employed a fully-crossed between-subjects factorial design to explore the relationship between (1) number of applications in a Facebook profile (none, low, medium, high), (2) gender of the Facebook profile owner (male, female), and (3) model gender pairing (single, paired) on levels of interpersonal liking, homophily, and behavioral intent. The coolness and distraction heuristics were measured as possible mediators in the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Results indicated that application level directly affects interpersonal liking when interacting with gender and model gender, while coolness and distraction heuristics influence interpersonal liking through more complex pathways. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Israeli Lesbigays Struggles to be Included Within the Mainstream",Global Sexualities,,,,Paper,"Co-Optation, Integration, Immersion, or Assimilation? Israeli Lesbigays Struggles to be Included Within the Mainstream",Global Sexualities,"This paper delineates various aspects  media representation and production, and formal and social institutions  of the efforts of the Israeli lesbigay community for collective self-definition and civil status. The title itself attests to the epistemic as well as political difficulties  not to say, a veritable minefield  involved in finding the proper and accepted key-word to describe these endeavors to be included and embraced within mainstream society. Although the paper delves into a specific socio-cultural locale, it may serve to trigger a transnational debate and inquiry: Can we see a paradigmatic shift or a clear-cut socio-historical trajectory in the lives of lesbigays across diverse loci today?"

Methods included a survey of 61 women with either breast cancer (n=31) or ovarian cancer (n=30). The findings revealed that women with BC had a higher level of problem-focused coping style, and attributed less importance to physicians emotional support and to nurses information and emotional support compared to women with OC. Coping styles were related to differences in perceived importance of physicians and of nurses information and emotional support. These findings have the potential to improve communication between women and their health care providers, as well as to advance the understanding of the importance of communication in coping with cancer."

It studies copyright as part of the process of understanding Chinas piracy issue. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the concept of copyright was introduced and established in Peoples Republic of China. China has never developed an indigenous counterpart of copyright in its legal system and public perception until 20th century. By examining the coverage of copyright related issues in Chinese newspaper, this paper attempts to address how copyright, a rather alien signifier to Chinese, was given meaning and installed as a relevant and legitimate concept."

In other words, these intercultural differences have been assumed rather than proven. This is likely because until recently social scientists did not have access to nationally representative data using similar communication network measures in both Japan and America. This paper is among the first of its kind to make communication network comparisons in Japan and America using such data. Our analysis is based on core discussion network data collected from the 2003 Japanese General Social Survey (JGSS) and the 2004 American General Social Survey (GSS). Although we find evidence that core discussion networks are longer lasting in Japan than America, our evidence does not support the view that kin and work institution dominate these networks more in Japan than America. We further find that communication occurs less frequently with core discussion networks in Japan than America. The implications of these results for theories of interpersonal collectivism in Japan are discussed."

Data on corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity was gathered from two media; the corporate annual reports (2004-08) and the internet websites of 10 Irish banks. The paper uses the findings of this research to explore key issues surrounding the role of communication professionals, and specifically public relations practitioners, in the management of corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Most current definitions of CSR tend to be underpinned by what is usually referred to as stakeholder theory, the idea that a wide range of organisational and social groups should play a role in determining the future direction of the company. It must be said however, that while the stakeholder concept has achieved widespread acceptance arguably much more needs to be done to put it into practice and that public relations can and should play a key role in this task. A key issue this paper will focus on is how PR practitioners can develop more robust methodologies for gathering stakeholder perspectives, assessing stakeholder needs and measuring CSR impacts.

Arguably a second key requirement for putting the stakeholder concept into practice in the management of CSR initiatives is the commitment to report and evaluate stakeholder feedback completely and truthfully and a willingness to engage with and respond to stakeholder needs and concerns. This paper will consider how corporate websites might be more positively utilised in this task and discusses how the adoption and development of interactive resources rather than the current reliance on expositive resources can facilitate this process."

This study grouped 2008 Fortune global 500 companies by region  North America, Europe, and Asia  and then analyzed what environmental issues they prioritize and how they share global environmental issues (e.g., climate changes) and whether they are any regional environmental issues that each region prioritizing (e.g., air pollution, water conservation, and deforestation). The results showed that European corporate websites are paid more attention to environmental issues, followed by North America and Asia respectively. With regard to environmental issues, most corporate websites place more importance on climate changes and resource/waste management but less importance on ecosystem management, and environmental governance. With regard to dialogic features, corporate websites are not fully employing the dialogic capacity. The results implicate that although corporate websites play a pivot role as an environmental information provider, they still are not fully employing dialogic features of the Internet."

Contrary to the corporate media critics and environmentalists claim of pro-industry bias, the study finds that newspapers become more critical of President George W. Bushs policy on global warming as they acquire the characteristics of the corporate form of organization. The results may suggest that the growth of corporate media, in fact, may help to explain many of the social changes during the last century that have benefited marginalized groups."
2009-0314,Corporate Social Responsibility and Outsourcing: Complicating Factors,Corporate Social Responsibility and Organizational Ethics,,,,Paper,Corporate Social Responsibility and Outsourcing: Complicating Factors,Corporate Social Responsibility and Organizational Ethics,"The increasing use of outsourcing as a management strategy for doing business has created interesting consequences relating to issues of globalization and corporate social responsibility (CSR). I argue that outsourcing represents a particular vexing challenge for CSR worldwide because of the ways it complicates (1) the matter of organizational boundaries, (2) the question of agency, and (3) the call for accountability. An analysis of codes of conduct, examples and regulatory bodies provide the evidence in examining the implications and consequences of how outsourcing not only complicates, but also opens up conversation regarding CSR. Implications dealing with a greater specificity within business ethics and organizational vulnerability will attempt to move the CSR conversation forward."

The results showed that the students perceived CSR to be an important ethical fit condition of a company. One of the significant findings is that CSR can be understood as an effective reputation management strategy for prospective employees, particularly when a company when a companys business is suffering. In examining the effect of CSR efforts on attitudinal and behavioral outcomes, person-organization (P-O) fit appeared to serve as a mediator between CSR performances and organizational attractiveness. By linking prospective public relations practitioners perception about CSR as their job seekers criteria, the study suggests their willingness to participate in CSR would be related when they become public relations practitioners."

The innuendo effect arises from the readers impaired ability to use both a main statement and its qualifier when making a judgment about a person, situation, or object, often leading to inaccurate perceptions. We tested the possible factors that moderate or reduce innuendo effect in two types of media innuendo situations: postcorrection type (Study 1: statementqualifier) and forewarning type (Study 2: qualifierstatement). In both studies, we found that participants with low processing motivation had difficulties in integrating the statement and qualifier, regardless of whether they were delivered from a highly credible source, producing the innuendo effect. In contrast, participants with high processing motivation were better in dealing with innuendo messages but considered the credibility of the source when making an impression judgment. Specifically, when source credibility was low participants were less likely to integrate the statement and qualifier in making their judgments, leading to the innuendo effect. However, when the source was highly credible participants more effectively integrated all information, reducing the innuendo effect. We discuss the practical implications of these findings in public communication. [192 words]"
2009-0317,Correlating a Motivation Activation Measure With Media Preference,"Entertainment, Values, and Media Preferences",,,,Paper,Correlating a Motivation Activation Measure With Media Preference,"Entertainment, Values, and Media Preferences","There is a substantial history in mass communications research of identifying individual differences which correlate with preferences for specific media genres and programming types. Work in this area conceptualizes individuals as active agents, capable of identifying needs and seeking to satisfy them. However, absent from much of this is an explicit recognition of the biological foundations for some of the identified needs that are satisfied through the selection of certain media. In the current study we build upon the more traditional uses-and-gratifications approach to media programming selection by first presenting a new measure known as the Motivation Activation Measure (MAM). We then use its theoretical underpinnings as an indicator of biologically-based appetitive and aversive motivation systemsalong with results from recent experimental results where MAM scores predict physiological and self-reported responses to specific types of media stimulito hypothesize the relationship between MAM scores and the types of media programming that individuals will report an interest in consuming. Results show individual differences in MAM scores are successful at predicting self-reported interest in specific programming genres across a wide range of media types."
2009-0318,Creating a Culturally Grounded HIV/AIDS Family Stigma Communication Scale,Culture-Centered Health Communication,,,,Paper,Creating a Culturally Grounded HIV/AIDS Family Stigma Communication Scale,Culture-Centered Health Communication,"UNAIDS (2006) reports that even though Sub-Saharan Africa is only home to 10% of the world population, it has 60% of people living with AIDS. As a result, the fight against AIDS has become two-fold: preventing new infections and improving the life of persons living with AIDS (PLAs). At the center of the work on improving the life of PLAs is the fight to eliminate stigma. UNAIDS (2002) defined stigma as a quality that significantly discredits an individual in the eyes of others. Understanding stigma is important because it creates an environment that makes it harder for prevention programs to have a meaningful impact. While considerable research has been done to advance such understanding in western contexts, the unique experiences of stigma in African populations remains understudied. Such research is certainly warranted by the stark number of AIDS cases in Africa. However, researchers have, for the most part, simply used scales developed in the west with African populations without thorough adequacy of these conceptualizations of stigma.
This research aims to change this reality by exploring HIV/AIDS family stigma communication measure in the African contexts.. First, the rationale for studying international health communication research is presented. Next, HIV/AIDS stigma measure literature is reviewed. In the subsequent sections, the methods and results are presented. Finally, the family stigma communication scale implications for HIV/AIDS are examined."

Young people are in many ways the defining users of this new culture, the quintessential early adopters of new technology, eagerly embracing a host of digital tools, integrating them into their daily lives, and forging a new set of cultural practices that are quickly moving into the mainstream. The public policy debate over children and new media continues to be dominated by Internet safety, fueled by persistent fears about pornography and predators.This ongoing public focus on Internet safet driven by the mediahas diverted attention away from a broader understanding of the role of digital media in the lives of young people. The transition to the Digital Age provides us with a unique opportunity to rethink the position of children in the media culture, and in society as a whole. While in the past, the focus was primarily on seeing children and youth as passive recipients of media content, the new media system enables young people to be much more active participants and co-creators
of content. This chapter will focus on creating a framework of consumer safeguards for children and adolescents in the growing digital marketplace. This presentation will first describe some of the major trends and practices that are shaping the new interactive market and discuss their implications for children and adolescents. It will then briefly review the history of childrens advertising and marketing policy in the United States. Two especially urgent issues food marketing and privacy policyin which prompt intervention could have the most significant and long-term impact on young people will be addressed. Finally, some suggestions for creating a broader policy agenda on behalf of children and youth in the new media will be made."

Some genre traditions, like melodrama, tend to be large, over-arching popular culture categories that already have a long history before television. Specific genres of television production, like the U.S. soap opera or the Latin American telenovela can develop within that larger tradition. Even more specific genres, like the Brazilian socially engaged or historical telenovelas, versus the romantic Mexican Cinderella story telenovela (Hernandez 2001), develop or emerge over time within those genre traditions. This paper traces the early history of the telenovela as a genre that was already regional or transnational, and the subsequent history of its specific adaptations and variations in Brazil and Mexico.

I used reflective journals with a diverse group of students in a large, compulsory, first year, one-semester engineering unit. I analyzed the changes through the first complementary use of two methodologies, Causal Layered Analysis and Dervins Sense-Making Methodology. My research explained how particular students resisted or reconstructed their worlds when challenged but within a supportive atmosphere, so it contributed to what educators might need to know, be and do, in order to teach effectively for sustainable futures."
2009-0322,Creative Journalism: What Do Print Journalists Think?,Journalism Studies Poster Session,,,,Paper,Creative Journalism: What Do Print Journalists Think?,Journalism Studies Poster Session,"Rather than focusing on the core ideas in journalisms domain, such as 'news', 'media', and 'journalism', this paper argues that 'creativity' is a keyword that should be investigated in the print journalism domain. Journalism is a form of writing that is seldom thought of as creative. The structures journalists work within are seen as constraining on the journalists production. This is an example of the Romantic view of creativity where an artist must be free from constraints to create.
However, if a rationalist approach is used, it can be demonstrated that it is structures, and the knowledge of these structures, that enable a journalist to produce. By using Csikszentmihalyis systems model of creativity as the principal theory, this paper provides evidence that a print journalist can be a creative producer. Furthermore, acknowledging that different genres of print journalism have different structures, it can also be argued that a journalist working in any genre can produce creative texts.
This paper is part of a wider qualitative study into the creative practices of the print journalist in Australia that is examining the journalists production within cultural and social contexts. The literature review has demonstrated that by marrying theories and definitions from creativity research with literature from the print journalism domain, creativity can be explained within journalism practices. Furthermore, analysis of interviews conducted with print journalists demonstrated they are very aware of the devices used, and the requirements of the field, to produce texts that are both novel and appropriate: a creative text."

The increased practice of using entertainment to promote healthy lifestyles has created a demand for new models of collaboration among practitioners and academics. In this article we present a model of creativity that facilitates collaboration between those who write and produce entertainment media and those who design and implement lifestyle campaigns. Examples are provided from several health campaigns showing how the model can help reduce misunderstandings and increase the synergy between media professionals and academics, resulting in more successful health communication. We conclude by providing several recommendations based on the model for media professionals, health communicators, and scholars who seek to collaborate on future health communication projects."

To help those managing a crisis, scholars have explored crisis communication from two approaches: the form and the content areas. Form research helps crisis managers better understand the different crisis episodes while content research focuses on exploring crisis messages and their effects on stakeholders. This paper examines methodological issues in crisis messages research. Of primary interest are empirical studies that have examined how crisis communication impacts audiences. We first analyze current methodological considerations for empirical research in crisis messages, and later we provide considerations in methodology to move this area forward."

In concert with Freire, Dervins Sense-Making Methodology (SMM) provides a theory of personal change over time and the tools and procedures by which reflexivity might be encouraged."

It outlines how such a theory operates by the example of the role of gifts and commodities in the Internet economy. It is argued that after the crisis of the New Economy, the emergence of what is termed Web 2.0 signifies the increasing importance of the Internet gift commodity strategy. This strategy commodifies the users who produce content and communications online on free access platforms so that advertisement rates are driven up and functions as a legitimizing ideology. In this context the notion the Internet prosumer commodity is introduced."

As for intention to sign, results indicated that attitude and subjective norm were positively related with intention to sign among Americans and Koreans, but attitude was a stronger predictor for intention for Americans than for Koreans. PBC was related to intention only for Koreans. As for intention to have family discussion, while attitude, subjective norm, and PBC were related to intention for both Americans and Koreans, PBC was a stronger predictor for intention for Koreans than for Americans. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

This study examines differences in the cultural motivations of South Korean and U.S. Americans to communicate by reflecting on their different motivations to approach (i.e., immediacy) and avoid (i.e., intercultural communication apprehension) communication. Analyses of self reports completed by high-context South Koreans and low-context U.S. Americans indicate that South Koreans have more overall shame and intercultural communication apprehension, than U.S. Americans. Further results show that South Koreans have greater intercultural communication apprehension and are less nonverbally immediate than their U.S. American counterparts."

Military refuseniks construct the Territories as a space of pollution, irrationality, disorder, and death, with the fear expressed that these qualities might seep into Israeli space and contaminate it; they employ metaphors of movement to portray the transition from here to there as a shift into an alternate universe; and they appropriate hegemonic conceptualizations associated with three culturally loaded spaces  the prison, the Jewish settlements in the Territories, and Nazi Germany  to attempt to destabilize the existing discursive spatial order. The intertwining of subversive and dominant frameworks of thought in refusenik discourse and their cultural implications are discussed."

This research extends that earlier research by identifying the cultural model of relationships. Two dimensions of this model were identified: long-term vs. short-term characteristics of romantic relationships and physical vs. nonphysical characteristics of romantic relationships. Interestingly, people who were heavy consumers of certain TV programs, movies, websites, and magazines had lower levels of acceptance of the cultural model of romance. Implications of these findings for future research on cultivation theory and the dynamic between culture and media are discussed."

Theory and research into the organization, storage, and retrieval of long-term memory are used to develop a scale for measuring past and present exposure to violent television. In a survey of 207 young adults, cultivation theory is tested using childhood exposure to violent television fiction and violent television news as predictor variables. The accessibility of violent constructs in memory and social reality beliefs are the primary dependent variables. Findings reveal an unexpected negative relationship between exposure to the news during elementary school and high school and social reality beliefs in young adulthood. Furthermore, there is a negative relationship between television news exposure during elementary school and the accessibility of violent constructs in young adulthood. Childhood exposure to fictional violence was not related to accessibility or social reality beliefs. Theoretical explanations for the findings and directions for future research are discussed."

A total of 255 Chinese international students and scholars recruited from ten universities in the United States were surveyed, and the overall relationship between online community use and cultural adaptation was found to be positive. More specifically, it was found that the more the subjects use ethnic online communities, the more support they perceive from, and the more positive their attitude toward, those communities. Moreover, the more support Chinese students perceive from ethnic online communities, the higher their socio-cultural adaptation level. However, their attitude toward ethnic online communities was not found to be significantly correlated with levels of socio-cultural adaptation. Also discussed are issues of how ethnic online communities serving as informational sources creates new forms of ethnic communities and fundamentally redefines the conception of cultural adaptation."

U. S. American undergraduates (n = 98) and Korean undergraduates (n = 105) read a vignette depicting a classmate breaking social engagement promise or a vignette depicting an interaction with a classmate of an older age, and reported their reactions towards each vignette. The results showed that U. S. Americans and Koreans differed in their politeness ratings for each vignette. Furthermore, for the vignette depicting an interaction with a classmate of an older age, U.S. Americans self-negative face need was negatively related to use of avoidance, whereas Koreans self-negative face need was positively related to use of avoidance. Across the two situations, self-negative face need was positively related to use of confrontation in both cultures and U.S. Americans were less confrontational than Koreans. Implications of the finings and future research directions were discussed."

Thus, the local community is one of their main publics, since it is the physical place where the museums are located, but, mainly, it is the most frequent consumer of the museums activities. In this way, Public Relations may be viewed as an important tool for museums to establish a long-term relationship with their local community.

The principal aim of this work is to study how museums communicate with their local community, analysing, on one hand, how people in the local community evaluate and inform themselves about the museums in their city, and studying , in the other hand, how museums identify their specific publics within the local community and communicate with them.

Results show that museums and exhibition centres have a narrow conception of publics, limiting them to the final user and the local schools. About the communicative actions developed by museums to establish relationships with publics, Public Relations activities are considered the most important ones to get involved with them. On the other hand, local community mainly inform themselves about museums activities through newspapers and friends."

The communication infrastructure theory (CIT) provides a useful framework to understand the contextual effects of residents participation in community-based cultural events as a part of larger communication environments in the community-building process and civic engagement. This study examines the processes that two community-based events, the Fiestas Patrias and the Korean Festival, undertake in order to play key roles in local storytelling networks that are associated with establishing and strengthening the connections between community residents and local organizations and, as a result, increasing a members integration into the community, a necessary step to increasing the civic engagement. I will look at 1) which cultural practices help local events become an integral part of the storytelling network and, as a result, 2) how storytelling roles as undertaken by community organizations and cultural events affect community members civic engagement and sense of belonging to their neighborhoods in regard to the CIT perspective. Linear regression analyses of surveys conducted with community participants illustrate that active participation in local events enhance a sense of belonging and engagement in their community by connecting them to other residents through meso level local storytelling networks. It is congruent with the CIT that community-based local events as local storytelling agents bridge the geo-ethnic immigrant communities and local community media and organizations and, as a result, reinforce community engagement in the neighborhood."
2009-0338,Cultural Studies: A (Still) Progressive Project to Challenge Power or an Anachronistic Project Unwittingly in the Service of Power?,The Politics of Researching Culture,,,,Paper,Cultural Studies: A (Still) Progressive Project to Challenge Power or an Anachronistic Project Unwittingly in the Service of Power?,The Politics of Researching Culture,"This paper argues that we are in the midst of a huge hegemonic displacement that fractures the old political formations and realigns the traditionally progressive movements with right-wing politics. The central question of the paper is: what is the role and place of Cultural Studies in this hegemonic slide? At the center of the discussion is the changing character of feminism and anti-racism through the debate on immigration.

Cultural Studies can be said to have initially started as a project to study the production of power relations in popular culture. However, today Cultural Studies is itself being slowly hegemonized. The clearest indication is the immense preoccupation with ethnic and cultural identities.

In this presentation, I argue that what we have been witnessing in Europe is the formation of a new type of hegemony that brings cultural distinctions to the forefront. This creates tensions within antiracist and feminist movements: once inequalities are articulated in terms of culture, religion and ethnicity, the political target for the struggle for equality gets confused and creates dilemmas for the movements. The same dilemma can also be traced in scholarly work of Cultural Studies scholars and I contend that it is the result of the inattentiveness to the new hegemony that reframes traditional sensitivities of Cultural Studies into the service of hegemonic politics. What we need is a newborn reflexivity that realigns our theoretical positions and political values with the wider context of the hegemonic slide."

In 1989, an ethnographic study within this tradition comparatively analyzed 50 such terms in 17 societies, and induced through such study a conceptual framework for their analysis (Carbaugh, 1989). Since the publication of that study, several other researchers have used that framework to analyze at least 100 such terms in over a dozen languages. This presentation reviews some of that literature, updates the framework, and discusses some of its further implications for the study of metadiscourse."

In order to examine actual self-description representative of self-construal, unaltered independently existing information was garnered from Caucasian Americans, African Americans, and ethnic Asians attending a Midwestern University. The information was obtained from Facebook, a popular social networking site used primarily by individuals to develop and maintain interpersonal relationships. Findings indicated that culture plays a significant role in influencing the communication of psychological attributes, individuating information, and the quantity of self-descriptive expression. Furthermore, evidence and argumentation is provided for a greater inclusion of African Americans in self-construal research."

Studies' was launched at the then Polytechnic of Central London (now the
University of Westminster)in 1975. It was the first and for some years the only
degree of its kind in Britain. Higher education in Britain had a two tier
system until 1992 when the 'polys' were upgraded to university status becoming
autonomous, degree-awarding bodies. The historic role of polytechnics,
from the mid 19th century, was to provide a useful 'technical' education for
aspiring members of the lower classes.

It is this authors contention, however, that this language, based on letters, numbers and punctuation marks, is something much more than the result of carelessness and laziness. Instead, it is a carefully crafted, alternate, anti-language, to borrow Hallidays term, which rebels against societal and familiar hegemonic norms. As this language pervades institutions throughout the world, one must stop to recognize its validity and longevity potential. Adopted by those hungry for private communication in the most public of places, this cyberspeak has gained a stronghold that is bleeding from an alternate, digital sphere, into the much more traditional public one."

Abstract
As we try to understand emotions in complex interactions between individuals and larger groups in cyber space, we are confronted with conceptual challenges to classical theories: We cannot meaningfully reduce our study to (1) a single level of analysis (e.g., individual, small groups, networks), due to the constant interaction between levels and their mutual non-additive influences, (2) single cause-and-effect chains due to cumulative effects over time and external influences that affect individuals or large groups, (3) single components of emotions (e.g., subjective experience, visible behavior, physiological changes) as none of them provide a gold-standard for emotions. Lastly, (4) as the Internet becomes increasingly multimodal and the media competences of users increase we cannot separate traditional types of media cleanly as any space of encounter may become a shrill mix of text, still and dynamic images from a variety of mass-mediated origins, sounds, original and reused contents and high levels of interactivity (see www.cyberemotions.eu)."

To examine how current popular culture in Korea is working alongside social institutions to move to the multicultural/multiracial society, this study investigates media representation of mixed-blood Koreans analyzing two soap operas and one movie in which Daniel Henny, one of the most popular mixed- blood Korean actors, played.
The major findings show the Korean popular media perpetuate the cultural colonialism and racism based on the ideology of White supremacy, and blood-puritism. Specifically, Daniel Hennys big success and increased public attentions toward the mixed-blood Koreans do not mean that Koreans traditional beliefs are changing, but it is a different type of racism preferring to westernized standard of beauty. At the same time, ironically, those soap operas and the movie I analyzed reveal Koreans strong desire for blood purity and the ideology of patriarchy is still exist."

Database work is at the origins of governmentality in the late eighteenth century (with the rise of the discipline of statistics) and has increasingly come to shape many aspects of communication in the 21st. This paper looks at the ways in which computer databases are shaping international discourse in the natural and social sciences. In particular, it asks what kinds of stories our current database structures permit and what they systematically exclude. Further, it examines the ways in which database contribution and use is shaping scholarly discourse in these fields. It ends with a call for developing a suite of tools for the critical reading of databases, and suggests some promising avenues for future research in this area."

Errors can be analyzed to uncover common patterns. This paper discusses the use of error pattern analysis as a methodological approach for games research, with particular emphasis on literacy games. The data are from a study involving 120 kindergarten, first, and second grade students who were labeled at-risk with regard to reading skills. For a period of eight weeks, students used a multimedia computer application including both video and interactive games that were focused on reading (decoding) skills. The research prototype included a suite of six games that logged students' performance, including reaction times and answer choices. Game performance analyses are compared with standardized assessment scores (DIBELS) to inform a preliminary discussion of how games might be used as an alternative form of evaluating student learning and understanding."

Conceived in 1932 as a sound factory, this building combined a massive stone exterior  at the time compared with a new Tower of London - with an inner tower of 22 radio studios, designed by a team of young modernists (including Wells Coates and Serge Chermayeff). While recent theory has tended to frame the links between media and architecture in terms of the visual, and/or the infiltration of a pre-existing domestic space, this paper will track how the spatial organisation of studios for sound reproduction reappears in architectural strategies for modern dwelling (i.e, in Coates Lawn Road Flats, 1932). In connection, earlier media representations of the interiors of Broadcasting House  including the thriller Death at Broadcasting House (1934)  are linked to the theories of Walter Benjamin (the liquidation of the interior, the origins of the detective story)."

A CNN/YouTube presidential primary debate was held for both the Democratic and Republican primary candidates. In fact, the creators of the CNN/YouTube debates claimed their novel use of Internet technology would change the face of presidential candidate debates. This experiment was designed expressly to engage citizens in the campaign dialogue, and specifically to engage those young citizens who are frequent users of YouTube yet not always among the audiences for a televised presidential debate. The current study examines the effects of viewing the CNN/YouTube debates, and particularly these debates influence on young citizens normative democratic attitudes and values. Results suggest that the CNN/YouTube debate dialogue was framed in ways that increased young citizens political efficacy and trust, decreased their political cynicism, and strengthened their political information efficacy."

It investigates a broad spectrum of media messages including anti-smoking ads, cigarette ads, and smoking scenes in movies and TV shows. Analysis of the LMTS-III data showed that perceived prevalence of peer smoking (descriptive norms) and perceived peer approval of smoking (injunctive norms) were important mediators in the relationships between exposure to smoking-related media messages and youths smoking intentions. The revealed mediated relationships suggest a series of complex mechanisms underlying media influence, which are only partially consistent with our expectations. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed."

It investigates why and how communication giants have pursued de-convergence in recent years, which will be a new keyword. Since de-convergence has been somewhat of a counter business strategy of convergence, the paper first examines the background and practice of convergence by examining M&As in the communication sector between early 1990s and 2007. Then, it analyzes why media companies have pursued de-convergence by employing split-off and spin-off strategies as their business model, and whether de-convergence will become a solid new trend replacing convergence. Finally, the paper articulates whether de-convergence of the media industry has consequently contributed to enhance the policy goals of competition, diversity, and promotion of democratic discourse that are embedded in antitrust laws and regulations relevant to mass media."

Since then debate has mostly focused on the meaning of public service, in light of commercialization and the rise of multiculturalism. Today we need to think more carefully about the meaning of the third term, broadcasting, which is under threat from the rise of on-demand television and increasingly personalized technologies of communication. On demand TV destroys the publicness of television which is realized in its fundamental broad-casting capacity that distinguishes it from narrow-cast technologies and narrow-cast communication. A common public life, the essence of democracy, is held in place by broadcast radio and television. The protection of the former requires a defense of the latter."

The paper begins by briefly outlining some of these threats, based on empirical work in three contemporary industries (television, music and magazine journalism). The paper goes on to argue that, in response to such attacks, intellectuals, while recognising the complex nature of the creativity-commerce dialectic, need to develop a robust critical and social conception of aesthetic autonomy in order to defend artistic production against the forces of marketisation and commodification. It is partly because critical intellectuals - including many cultural producers - have lost faith in aesthetic autonomy that it has become so vulnerable to penetration by these forces. Possible bases for such a critical and social conception of aesthetic autonomy are discussed, most notably work by Nicholas Garnham and Russell Keat."

theoretical decisions. Firstly, the central term journalism has to be defined, in order to explain,
which area of media communication can be observed and to what extent its findings may be interpreted.
Secondly, it has to become clear, how stability and change should be measured. Both research
projects presented in this panel do empirical research on the bases of the system theoretical
perspective and use a similar theoretical definition of journalism, focusing on its function for society.
However, their objects of investigation differ, as well as their methodical and empirical approach
to analyzing change. This paper describes how journalism is defined and how journalistic
change is measured, in order to discuss the theoretical and empirical consequences of these fundamental
decisions. Methodologically, a multi-stage strategy is used to define journalism. Change is
measured by surveying journalists at different times (1993 and 2005), by content analyzing over a
period of time (from 1990 until 2005) and by conducting retrospective in-depth interviews."

This lack of conceptual clarity might be understood as the cause of logical inconsistencies found in entertainment literature, such as the paradox of enjoying negatively-valanced media. We address how explicating enjoyment as the satisfaction of needs resulting from media use might address these issues. The present study presents an explication of enjoyment as the satisfaction of needs related to psychological well-being. In an experiment designed to validate this conceptualization of enjoyment, we manipulate game characteristics related to the satisfaction of three needs derived from self-determination theory and examine the relative effect on enjoyment. The validated model explains 51 percent of variance in the construct, even without including needs usually studied in relation to enjoyment such as pleasure-seeking. Results indicate the utility of defining enjoyment as need satisfaction. These results are discussed in terms of a broader conceptualization of enjoyment represented as the satisfaction of a comprehensive set of functional needs."

Drawing on the concept explication methods of Chaffee (1991), we propose definitional limits and qualities essential to the understanding of concurrency in any given setting. Applying this framework to the qualitative analysis of focus group discussions from central Mozambique, we explicate sexual concurrency as it is understood in these semi-rural communities in the Zambezia province. Respondents in our focus groups described five concurrency behaviors under the endogenous term of a sexual walking around outside the home. Different outside the home encounters carried distinct social valuations depending on factors such as relationship duration and degree of HIV risk. HIV prevention agencies could enhance health communication design by using local terminology and addressing each socially-constructed category separately."

These two terms are distinctly different and need to be explored in future research. This paper seeks to explore the distinctions between these terms and how they should be used in future communication research. For example, the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification, a social scientific system that has been used in the United Kindgom and internationally, has many categories, ranging from employment in large establishments and higher managerial occupations to people who have never worked and the underemployed (Rose & Pevalin, 2003). Research that comes from various paradigmatic perspectives uses the term social class to describe the differences of identities that they are studying (Brandis & Henderson, 1970; Maas & Gonzalez, 2005), yet these studies are exploring socioeconomic class. Despite this conflation between terms, social class needs to be distinguished as a term that explores the complexities of various ideological worldviews that people have based upon socioeconomic classifications."

We also examine the processes  affective and cognitive  that lead from perceived diversity to follow-up engagement, and assess whether these processes depend on ideological strength. We find that follow up engagement among strong ideologues is primarily affected by their prior civic and political participation. Weak ideologues, in turn, are mobilized through cognitive reactions to perceived diversity, and moderate ideologues through affective reactions. Our results add to the debate on deliberative versus participatory democracy, suggesting that research should focus on individual characteristics and underlying mechanisms."

Yet theorists and practitioners have struggled with how to establish deliberative equality in the face of stark differences of power in liberal democracies. Designers of innovative civic forums for deliberation often aim to neutralize inequities among participants through proportional inclusion of disempowered speakers and discourses. In contrast, others argue that democratic equality is best achieved when disempowered groups deliberate in their own enclaves (interest groups, parties, and movements) before entering the broader public sphere. Borrowing from each perspective, we argue that there are strong reasons to incorporate enclave deliberation among the disempowered within civic forums. We support this claim by presenting case study evidence showing that participants in such forums can gain some of the same benefits of deliberation found in more heterogeneous groups (such as political knowledge, efficacy and trust), can consider a diversity of viewpoints rather than falling into groupthink and polarization, and can persuade external stakeholders of the legitimacy of the groups deliberations."
2009-0359,"Deliberative Strategy ""On the Fly""",The Practice of Deliberation,,,,Paper,"Deliberative Strategy ""On the Fly""",The Practice of Deliberation,"A school board is a governing body that represents the local school district community. Its meetings, with very explicit and limited exceptions, must be open to the public. The deliberative interaction analyzed in this paper is of a school board that must decide how to evaluate its superintendent, one of its most significant and consequential duties. An audience is observing the meeting, and it is being video-recorded for public broadcast. Of the seven-member board, one board member has consistently questioned superintendent actions and proposals throughout the superintendent's eight-month employment and is seen as the ""maverick"" board member. In this extract, the maverick board member proposes an instrument to be considered for use in the superintendent's evaluation, and that the board focus on staff morale during the evaluation process.

The analysis shows how this board member uses the ambiguity of certain utterances when making her case to introduce new points that deflect the efforts of others to shut her down. When an utterance redirects the conversation to another reason why morale should be part of the evaluation process, the utterance is relevant to its antecedents or consequents, but varies just enough for the focus of the discussion to change slightly. This allows the board member to get out from the continued challenging utterances of the other members and the superintendent at any particular juncture. After several minutes of ""dodging and weaving,"" one of the board members abruptly calls for a vote thus ending the ""deliberation."" I conclude that while the emergent interactional pattern of this extract does not reflect rational decision-making proper, ambiguity has been used strategically to advance ulterior goals."

It is generally assumed that the liberalization and commercialization of media systems lead to the strengthening of tabloidization trends. Nevertheless, the literature focuses heavily on postindustrial nations and does not explain important trends in new democracies. The paper analyzes how processes of media transformation in transitional societies affect the quality of elections as accountability mechanisms. More specifically, it examines how the opening of TV Globo, Brazils dominant media company, affected patterns of election news coverage, with important implications for the countrys process of democratization. Based on a content analysis of 60 full broadcasts of Jornal Nacional, TV Globos main newscast, and interviews with four former Brazilian Presidents and fifteen journalists, the paper identifies significant improvements in the networks news coverage, including a decline of explicit news biases and horse race coverage. The conclusions stress how Brazils process of democratization forced TV Globo to change and adapt as a way of recovering credibility and avoiding the loss of market position."

Yet after the commission passed the new rules, which would enable further consolidation of the broadcasting industry, it immediately faced tremendous opposition from citizens, activist groups, and congressional leaders who conjoined their specific attack to a broader-based condemnation of deregulation. This paper focuses on the participation of the National Organization for Women (NOW) in this battle over media ownership and illustrates how NOW recast the impact of deregulation as a feminist issue. In keeping with previous media reform campaigns, NOW has used its fight over media ownership not only to challenge existing policies and practices, but also to register how prevailing regulatory frameworks have impeded upon the civil rights of women.

Although this has been a counterbalance to the older books, it has neglected descriptive material (e.g. broadcast setup, leading newspapers, news agencies, etc.), and brief histories. Especially if undergrads are to be considered in the audience, forthcoming textbooks should deal more realistically with theory and practice internationally.

In addition to low socioeconomic status (SES), race and ethnicity are factors, with 16% of white children overweight, compared to 20% of African American and 19% of Hispanic children. Addressing this epidemic requires culturally relevant interventions with a family-behavioral component. To gather information that could guide development of interventions designed to help parents raise healthy children, seven 90-minute focus groups were conducted with low SES parents (N=43). These focus groups investigated participants challenges raising children with healthy eating and exercise habits, as well as their Internet use. Most participants have used the Internet to search for health information and trust information provided by universities. Study findings also point to important design considerations for low health literate audiences and less sophisticated Internet users."

These games extend the game play geographically, temporally and socially. Additionally, they can be used to produce goods of value also outside of the game itself. With such promising and manifold possibilities to design new gaming experiences, it is not surprising that the design challenges of these games are only partly understood. In this essay we present an overview of five known design challenges (dealing with uncertainty, hybrid architectures, hefting domains, configuration and orchestration) and two new design challenges (geographic separation of players, and the integration of non-gaming tasks). We illustrate solutions to these challenges by describing the design process of our LBMG CityExplorer in detail. The results of four use case studies of CityExplorer show that our game design decisions can be taken as a basis for the design of LBMGs in general."

As the use of discussion groups became routine within cyberspace in the 1990s (following earlier developments in the 1970s and 1980s), it became clear that, by and large, system designers were simply replicating structures of communicating that, as in the past, concretized and reinforced hegemonic aspects of dialogue based on transmission and persuasion oriented theories of communication. My project has attempted to apply Sense-Making Methodology to both understand how online communicating is practiced and to intervene with designs based on communication theories of dialogue."

However, IS and healthcare literatures seldom explore IS continuance among e-health. Even though e-health is gaining importance, its quality is a cause for concern among users, as the consequences of inaccurate and misleading information could pose potential communication misnomers. Responding to this concern and attempting to address the gap in IS and e-health literatures, and improving healthcare communication with the publics, this paper reports an initial study to examine the factors influencing consumers satisfaction, trust and intention to continue using healthcare Web portals. Findings from prior IS usage research was used to theorize an integrated research model, which considers satisfaction and trust as the main factors influencing users continuance intention along with perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Research hypotheses derived from this model are empirically validated using a field survey. Partial Least Squares (PLS), a structural modeling technique, was used for analysis. Results are consistent with previous technology acceptance studies: users continuance intention is determined by satisfaction, which in turn is jointly determined by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and trust. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the constructs used in our research model for e-health, and also understanding the outcomes associated with the new digital media and platforms."

Given that Internet piracy is a crime that accompanies risk, individuals risk perception associated with the act of Internet piracy should play a significant role in determining individuals attitudes and behavior pertaining to Internet piracy. To investigate the effects of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and peer influence on the act of piracy, this study conducts a survey using 250 college students in Singapore.
In short, the present study is to address a gap in the literature by presenting the examination of risk perception in the context of Internet piracy. We believe that the study will provide policy makers and business organizations with insightful understanding the risk perception and help them develop effective methods to reduce instances of Internet privacy among college students."

The Integrated Crisis Mapping (ICM) model is based on a public-based, emotion-driven perspective where different crises are mapped on two continua, the organizations engagement in the crisis and primary publics coping strategy. This third and final stage testing, representing the fifth in the series, found further evidence that anxiety is the default emotion that publics feel in crises. The subsequent emotions felt by the publics in crises involving transport failure, security issues and human resource problems were variations of sadness and anger. As far as coping strategies were concerned, evidence suggests strong merit that conative coping is the external manifestation of the internal cognitive processing that has already taken place. Cognitive coping is thus the antecedent of conative coping. Though both the publics and the organizations agreed that the crises were relevant to the organizations goals, they differed on who should assume more responsibility. Organizations should still reach out to publics by being seen to be more engaged regardless of whether they felt they were responsible for the crises. The findings, while still very much exploratory, suggest theoretical rigor in the model, with room for further refinements to generate what Yin (2003) termed analytic generalization (p. 33) for the ICM model."

In this essay, I propose that two pop cultural phenomena reflect a desire to escape from such tyranny. First, I will examine ""emo,"" short for ""emotional hardcore,"" a form of inward-looking post-punk music that emerged in the late 1980s that privileges sincerity as a reaction to punk's nihilism and irony. Further, I suggest that emo is a musical precursor to ""mumblecore,"" a recent cinematic movement of sorts that dramatizes the intense desire for human connection amid the cultural logic of irony and the ubiquity of communication technologies that ultimately alienate as opposed to foster face-to-face connection. Both emo and mumblecore reflect do-it-yourself (DIY) youth cultures that reject the trappings of irony in favor of sincerity, presence, and community. Together, I argue, these outwardly disparate phenomena are bound by a Utopian sentiment that suggests a way out of postmodern schizophrenia and the potential for the creation of a better place."

This study focuses on this age group by exploring how the various news media are differentiated by college students through duration of news use and reason for news access. The goal is to better address young adults news needs and habits. Using a time-space diary method, participants recorded their news media consumption during an assigned 24-hour period. Results were interpreted following a niche theory perspective (Dimmick, 2003) to determine how duration and reason for news access increased the likelihood of each medium being used (competitive superiority). The data suggest young adults view the newspaper medium more as a leisure or entertainment activity, while computers and mobile media are used more often for specific information gathering."

Studies range from the effects of porn on sexual violence (for a review of these studies see Segal, 1993) to assessments of the relationship between porn and culture/society (see for example Kipnis, 1996). Lesbian porn is a particularly interesting subgenre that has received some, though the Internet version less (one exception being Balderson, 2004), academic attention. Images of lesbians in porn have been created and used by both lesbian/bisexual female audiences and heterosexual male audiences. Porn featuring lesbian sexuality, therefore, lends itself to diametric readings, purposes and implications for minority representation. For example, the lesbian produced porn magazine on our backs brings lesbian desire above ground, affirming its legitimacy and encouraging lesbian women to find and embrace what pleases them sexually (Henderson, 1999, p. 509). The girl-on-girl scenes produced in pornography for male audiences, on the other hand raise questions of authenticity in a community whose members are wary of images- particularly sexual ones- that somehow refer to us but which we perceive to be unintended for our pleasure (Henderson, 1999, p. 508). How images of lesbians in pornography are situated as either for straight male audiences or lesbian audiences has not been thoroughly investigated, particularly in the realm of internet pornography. To that end, this study analyzes the visual and textual content of 2 meta-porn sites, Penisbot and Cyberdyke, and six sites each of those aimed at a lesbian/bisexual female audience or a heterosexual male audience."

Along with participant observation, 26 in-depth interviews were conducted to explore how social norms and opinion leaders influenced members media choices. Although adequate technical infrastructure was in place, qualitative data analysis revealed how social norms reinforced face-to-face communication as the primary mode of communication among organizational members. Lack of technical know-how and slow adaptation to external technological change directly impacted low email usage. These findings revealed the importance of 1) improving organizational members technical competence before initiating changes affecting technology use and 2) approaching this issue from an open system perspective."

Since 2002, the online organization Perverted Justice has worked to investigate adults and adolescents who solicit online sexual conversations with PeeJ organization members posing as children. In particular, the organizations practice of posting in their website forums entire chat transcripts, phone conversations, photographs and personal phone numbers of those men who solicit organization members has come under scrutiny from policy makers, media organizations, and private citizens alike. My analysis of the site strives to understand the ways in which the figure of the sexual predator is mobilized to make claims about the proper divisions between publicity and privacy, legality and illegality, vengeance and justice, citizenship and non-citizenship, and sexual identity and sexual desire within public discourse. Additionally I explore how identity categories like gender, sexuality, and age function in an online mediated environment to produce panic directed at the social order, in both online and offline iterations. The panic produced at the PeeJ forums contains a particular set of contradictions suggesting deep anxieties about mediated subjectivity within digital cultures. This essay provides a much-needed corrective to existent work on moral panic and digital media within media and cultural studies and contribute to an ever-growing body of feminist and queer media studies that calls for critical, politically-minded interrogation of the relationship between media and public culture."

This study examined how Digital Storytelling fosters community participation and empowerment in the theoretical tradition of participatory communication, the anthropology of visual communication, and narrative empowerment theory. The author argues that Digital Storytelling as an innovative participatory media practice empowers those involved, both as a process and a product. The dialogic processes of co-producing the stories between the facilitator and the participants bring new understanding and new interpretive frameworks that enable mutual learning and a sense of affinity and personal commitment. As a product, the stories belong to particular genre the author terms as biodocudrama that enables the storytellers to use dramatized narratives to search for and articulate positive, transformative, empowering meanings. Inscribing the stories into local public space through exhibit, screenings, the Internet, and donation to public educational institutions in the San Gabriel Valley gave a greater sense of pride and collective efficacy to the storytellers. The storytelling practice also refashioned the discourse around ACCAs organizational identity and its place of belonging."

Resorting to Information Society arguments, Italian policy-makers contended that DTT would be a means of overcoming the digital divide by providing free, universal access to television services in the digital age. This paper examines the DTT strategies of Italian public service broadcaster RAI and commercial broadcaster Mediaset as they have tried to reposition themselves in the emerging digital multi-channel market environment. It shows that reality has diverged substantially from early government-endorsed visions. Five years after its launch, DTT has established itself primarily as a platform for the provision of pay-TV services by Mediaset in competition with Murdochs satellite-based Sky Italia. Meanwhile, underfinanced and lacking a consistent strategy, RAI risks being relegated to the margins of the emerging digital television market. The paper also explains how public policy has fundamentally shaped market outcomes."

Developed from the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP), the information density measure is related to the cognitive resources requirements for message processing which compares the information preceding and following a camera change on seven dimensions. In a previous study (Kurita et al., 2008), researchers observed increased secondary task reaction times (STRTs) and visual recognition accuracyindicating reduced available resources and enhanced encoding processwith each additional dimension up to level 4. Deteriorating STRTs and recognition after dimension level 5 suggest the occurrence of cognitive overload as a result of excessive information density. The present study is to address the question of whether there is variation in the resources requirements of the various dimensions, and to what extent the pattern of results found previously depended on the precise order in which the dimensions were added. During experiment, 120 participants will view 35 minutes of television, which include 36 camera changes made up of 6 of each of six dimensions alone, and 36 camera changes that combine two dimensions with 6 repetitions of each. STRTs and recognition data will be collected at points of interest in the stimulus. Their differences between each type of camera change and between change and no change will be examined to determine the individual impact of each of the seven dimensions on cognitive load and visual encoding."

But past writing on context has left it a slippery matter how speakers and hearers know and agree on what counts an utterances context is. The proposal here is that an utterances context is a function of what activity the parties believe they are currently engaged in. Given what the current activity is believed to be, then not all and not just any imaginable way of contextualizing utterances and interpreting them will do. This paper proposes how beliefs are formed about what the current activity is and why parties may have discrepant beliefs. Two interactions are examined to reveal evidence of the parties orientation to the issue of what their current activity is, and the way their interpretations of each others utterances depend on that."

In post-communist Romania, scholarship analyzing these negotiations has thus far focused on official and/or intellectual discourses, leaving the sphere of popular culture greatly underanalyzed (Roman). In this presentation, I examine the Romanian media's responses to the popularity of ""manele, a music genre specific of Romanian Gypsies/Roma. Focusing on the themes of manele's linguistic, social, and aesthetic effects, rather than explicitly referencing the ethnicity of musicians, the media try to present an ethnically pure and non-hybridized notion of Romanianness. Their discussion of manele indicates that anxieties of national identity are being played out through popular culture and formulated within a racist logic that precludes more politically progressive negotiations of national identity."
2009-0388,Disciplining the Journal: Journaling a Discipline,The Communicative Constitution of Organization: Multiple Approaches,,,,Paper,Disciplining the Journal: Journaling a Discipline,The Communicative Constitution of Organization: Multiple Approaches,"The formulation of fresh propositions is one of the raisons dêtre of a disciplinary journal. Another, as we will argue here, is the construction, negotiation, and continual re-creation of the discipline in question. More specifically, we contend that a discipline can be conceptualized as an organization, incarnated, embodied and performed (Cooren, 2006) by a heterogeneous assembly of agents collectively engaged in an ongoing dance of agency (Pickering, 1995). Drawn from our own empirical experience, this article offers an example of some steps of this dance: We describe how fresh propositionsor in our case publishable manuscriptsget formulated through the review process of a particular disciplinary journal. We employ the notion of script to describe how the assembly of agents implicated in the journal adhere to the steps of the dance (or script) of what constitutes a fresh and valid proposition and, by extension, how this links to the broader thing known as the discipline. Specifically, we follow the stream of action of a manuscript as it travels through the review process to show the human and non-human actors who make a difference in their interactionswho dance togetheralong the way. In so doing, we aim to illustrate one way that the discipline is constructed."
2009-0389,Disciplining the Performances of Electronic Media,The Management of Mediated Performance,,,,Paper,Disciplining the Performances of Electronic Media,The Management of Mediated Performance,"Sociology has provided comprehensive theorizations of how institutions impose various forms of (self)discipline on subjects. From different theoretical starting-points, Erving Goffman and Michel Foucault have made interestingly similar arguments about the pervasiveness and comprehensiveness of discipline in so-called total institutions. The paper draws on these theorists to argue that institutions for electronic mediation are total in the specific sense of premeditating performances in particularly comprehensive ways. It looks into two main ways of doing this: Via practices of performer training, and via a wide array of modes of scripting. Of particular interest is the training required for performances that seem natural and spontaneous while at the same time being comprehensively premeditated by various forms of scripts. Throughout the discussion, references will be made to ethnographic production studies of popular journalism, reality, and interactive TV formats. Particular emphasis will be placed on the construction of the studio as a space and a set of technologies tailored to the needs of comprehensive (self)discipline and the performative construction of subjectivity."

Previous organizational identity research has explored how females develop their subjectivities within traditionally feminine roles as they are controlled by and resist Discourses of patriarchy. This study expands that research through an exploration of the identity construction process of women in a traditionally masculine Park Service role. In addition, most identity research has been criticized for neglecting to examine the specific, discursive details that influence identity construction. This study utilizes a postmodern, feminist lens to explore the discursive identity construction of backcountry rangers in Glacier National Park within a dialectic of control and resistance."

Drawing on concrete empirical examples of the mediated visbility of suffering, I argue that the analysis of media culture today could benefit from a reflexive Discourse Analysis approach, which i) prioritises questions of ethics, under conditions of cultural globalisation and the de-territorialisation of social relationships and moral commitments; ii) grasps the question of ethics from the pragmatic perspective of discursive practice and focuses on the instantiation of ethical values in the texts of mediation (phronesis); and iii) effectively combines the interest in the production of hybrid media texts (multi-modal analysis) with the interest in political power both as hegemony and as governmentality."

To do so, we discuss exemplars from our multi-country database of interviews, focus groups, and documents. Exemplar selection is based on several criteria: these stories must provide unique theoretical insights into Chinese and U.S. occupational and career socialization; they must be representative of messages within and across country data; and they must enable comparison and contrast of national, economic, familial, media, and developmental life phase macro-discourses and materials realities. Our findings highlight the processual nature of work and career socialization, changing meanings and meaningfulness of work, and contextual influences in shaping work and career discourses."
2009-0396,Discourses of Diversity in Irish Broadcasting,Dialogues and Conflicts: Points of Contact in Media Production and Policy,,,,Paper,Discourses of Diversity in Irish Broadcasting,Dialogues and Conflicts: Points of Contact in Media Production and Policy,"The idea of diversity has become an important notion for European broadcasters seeking to position themselves in a 'post-multicultural' landscape. This paper analyses the adoption of a diversity framework by the Irish public service broadcaster RTE, and examines how the elasticity of the idea of diversity involves ambiguities which must be confronted in institutional practices. It argues that while renewed institutional presentations through diversity are partially motivated by the need to transcend multiculturalism's now problematic political connotations, a residual liberal multiculturalist logic shapes the relevant programming and institutional framing. This logic co-exists with other dominant discursive understandings of diversity as a depoliticised form of social capital, but also as a notion that always involves not only questions of equality, but normative questions of what is and what is not framed as diversity in a given context."

Focusing on world news slide-shows in web versions of national newspapers, where picture paragraphs from around the world are showcased in a continuous row and thereby take on meaning from each other, discourses of oneness versus discourses of particularity are discussed. These discourses are connected both to different notions of globalization and to different notions of identity politics, in the latter case to identity politics as recognition versus redistribution of means, and to the different models of the recognition paradigm: the identity model and the status model. Uses of discourses of particularity and the reifying identity model are concluded to be dominating, even in reports from May day celebrations and demonstrations, that could have been anticipated to connect more to both oneness and to status (the recognition of individuals as citizens). These results are furthermore connected to the ratio of the genre, and the studied sub-genre. A discussion on cultural and technological globalization frames the analysis and culturalistic explanations of differences in the world are connected to the appearance of differences between different parts of the world as well as of different strata within societies as natural."
2009-0398,Discourses on the Down Low: The Mediated Construction of an HIV/AIDS Policy Problem,The Political Uses of Black Popular Culture,,,,Paper,Discourses on the Down Low: The Mediated Construction of an HIV/AIDS Policy Problem,The Political Uses of Black Popular Culture,"Since the mid-1990s we have witnessed the ascension, in black popular discourse and mass media more generally, of the down low, a term which is generally used to describe any relationship or activity kept discreet but also refers to the experiences of black men who have sex with other men (and women) and do not identify as gay. Two major conceptualizations or explanations have emerged to describe this subset of black culture. The identification model suggests that down low brothers are victims of excessively homophobic black communities, which are unable to make room for gay and lesbian identities within blackness. The second mode of explanation relies on fantasies about black masculinity that mark black men as inherently dangerous, deceptive, and prone to trickery. Both explanatory models render invisible the nature of sexuality as a dynamic, fluid process constructed, at least in part, at the intersections of desire and space. This essay examines the myriad ways mass media constructs the down low, attempting to explain both the trajectory of the term, and its apparent crossover from popular music, as in R. Kellys 1996 hit Keep it On the Down Low (Nobody Has to Know) to hard news, as well as discuss the relationship between medias framings of the down low and the construction of the category MSM (men who have sex with men) in health policy. It argues that, while the down low requires certain deeply held stereotypes about black masculinity and sexuality to accrue its meaning, it persists not only because it resonates with those beliefs but also because it becomes an explanatory mechanism for the dramatic increase of HIV/ AIDS cases among black women."

Yet, many malpractice claims suggest patients perceive problems with its handling (e.g., standardization). Moreover, previous studies lack the nuance of discursive perspectives, theoretical grounding, and recognition of ICs sociohistorical context. Drawing on a structurational perspective, which conceives of IC as constituted by contradictory sociohistorical structures (discursive formations) representing different groups interests in controlling IC, this study examines how the Discourse of liabilityrepresenting the interests of states and administrative entitiesis (re)produced in accounts of practice. Focus groups reveal radiologists reproductions through a work system of blind IC, narrowing of IC, and through limited verbal practices."
2009-0400,Discourse Swings in Understanding Audiences: Case Studies on Hollywoods Co-Optation of Activity as Emergent Discourse,Media Audiences Between Production and Consumption,,,,Paper,Discourse Swings in Understanding Audiences: Case Studies on Hollywoods Co-Optation of Activity as Emergent Discourse,Media Audiences Between Production and Consumption,"Traditional discourses of the relationship between media producers and consumers have been challenged as of late in post-industrialized countries. The blurring of the traditional consumer/producer dichotomous identities due to changes in the mediascape, forecasted for decades, has changed how both academics and media professionals characterize the role of people in media engagings. The initial conceptualization of audience-as-commodity was challenged by increased recognition of the audience as active consumers, or audience-as-agent. Recently this recognition has led to the Hollywood media industrys cooptation of these consumers, conceptualizing the people who engage with their media products as a combination of the previous two, or ""audience-as-pusher"". This paper is a brief account of this discourse swing, with a focus on the emergent conceptualization through the description of case studies. Four means of the industrys cooptation are illustrated: direct cooptation; expanded experience; classic viral marketing; and, gameplay viral marketing. The emergent conceptualization and its relationship with previous ones present academics with challenges and opportunities for theorizing and studying the relationships between the media industry and the people in their everyday lives."

Despite multiple efforts to reach an underrepresented groupwomenin the technology field, there is a converse result that might be classified in Foucaults (1988) terms as confinement, relegating women to certain technology roles. This confinement occurs on two levels, the specific technology roles and programs as well as the eventual retention of females in the job force. Therefore, government agencies and NGOs, and the U. N. World Summit on the Information Society place emphasis on finding ways to encourage women, in all parts of the world, to use technology, become comfortable with it, and ultimately enter the technology workforce.
The paper analyzes how the discrepancy of gender in technology be addressed without creating and legalizing categories of gender. It explores concerns of essentialism of policies and procedures attempting to address gendered issues are likely to negatively impact the gender divide. In order to address this gender gap, a process known as gender mainstreaming has developed. In the information technology sector, this process involves encouraging corporations and governments to increasingly hire and incorporate women and womens issues into technology production, work, and play. The paper analyzes how gender mainstreaming has become the standard mechanism for promoting gender internationally."

We compare the use of discussant generators and, for lack of a better term, general approaches to the measurement of network size, agreement, and disagreement. We further evaluate various criteria for assessing agreement, including shared party identification, shared gender, shared race, and respondent self-assessment of tendency to politically agree with specific discussion partners. We assess the extent to which research conclusions about the size of networks and the extent of exposure to political disagreement are likely to vary based on these different measurement approaches in the literature. We also evaluate the extent to which associations between network size, agreement, and disagreement and outcomes such as political knowledge and political participation are likely to vary depending on the measurement approach. We conclude that descriptive assessments are probably only weakly affected, but relationship assessments may well be more substantially affected by measurement technique, especially for network size."

Nakamura has argued that networked world without limits is represented by vivid and often sublime images of displayed ethnic and racial difference in order to bracket them off as exotic. Martin Kevorkian, in his work on Color Monitors pointed to how there is continued placement of the back body in relation to technologies in American visual cultures that serves to place the African-American so that they simultaneously appear less threatening and more disciplined as subjects of modernity. Thus bodies of color are contained in technospaces. In this presentation, I will extend these arguments and examine instances of identity production and network interaction within the three-dimensional gamelike environment known as Secondlife. Having developed the notion of technocultural agency at the online/offline interface I look at performances and embodied voicings in these online settings."

Glocalization means interaction of the global and the local. When the park was first opened, it was such a financial debacle that it has become the typical case study on how not to open a theme park. The mistake that Disney did was to use its traditional method to force-feed its U.S. products to local cultures. The main premise of this paper is that even a giant like Disney has to show adaptation to local preferences in order to generate maximal profits and remain competitive."

The major challenge in conducting this kind of research is finding appropriate indicators that equally apply to different countries and cultures. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes an individual differences perspective. The main idea is that the spiral of silence is driven by two correlated personality traits, the fear of social isolation and the willingness to self-censor. Based on the theory, we examined the correlation and means of both traits for American, Chinese, German, and French language data. Results confirmed the expected correlation for all cultures except for China. Furthermore, Chinese respondents scored higher on willingness to self-censor, but lower on fear of social isolation compared to the other cultures. Results are discussed in terms of their relevance to cross-cultural spiral of silence theory and methodology."

Highly conformist, dogmatic people expect strong solidarity and group devotion from their ingroup members. The study informs the way individual differences mediate perceptions of negative rhetoric coming from allied versus non-allied countries.
Using the framework of the Social Identity and the Self-Categorization theory, this study investigates the impact of nationalism, dogmatism, message type, and message source on the salience of individuals' social identities. Two experiments on 625 American students revealed that peoples sense of belongingness to a group is shaped by their preference as well as their perception of the group. This perception is very much influenced by the communication environment. In the context of the War on Terror, our results explain how Americans may react today to nation-hate messages coming from ingroup members like family, as well as outgroup European and Middle Eastern sources."

For this reason, this study investigates the presentation of genetic research relating to cancer outcomes and behaviors (i.e., prostate cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, smoking and obesity) from its original presentation in a scholarly journal (N=20), through an intermediary press release (N=23), to its publication in mainstream print media (N=71). Central claims, expressing gene-outcome relationships, were extracted and evaluated by expert raters. Raters judged claims within the press release as being significantly more representative of the material within the original science journal article compared with news article claims. Findings partially support a social constructivist approach to science reporting. That is, claims originating in news articles which demonstrated contact with individuals not directly involved in the research were judged by experts to be more representative of the original science as compared with those that demonstrated contact with individuals directly involved in the research. Our evaluation methods prove to be highly reliable and valid, contributing to future research by providing an alternate approach (i.e. expert raters as parallel instruments) to evaluating complex science and its presentation in subsequent sources."

These news values result in reportage that is described as disturbing by the young Australians of Middle Eastern descent we have interviewed, provoking affects such as disgust, contempt, fear, sadness. It creates a sense of alienation and identity confusion that compromises the strength of their commitment to Australian culture, along with extreme puzzlement about the value of citizenship. The world in which contemporary young Australians live is marked by radical cultural diversity that requires well-developed diplomatic skills to avoid open conflict and schoolyard fights. Yet they notice little respect for the cultural diversity of their worlds in the mainstream media. This panel provides an opportunity to discuss a recently completed investigation into how news disturbs by disturbing affects, and of the future for affect-based approaches in media research."

We map the main discursive shifts within this policy domain at a European level. The empirical analysis focuses on two Nordic public service broadcasting companies - YLE in Finland and SVT in Sweden. Both companies have policies concerning ethnic and cultural diversity. In addition the two companies have downsized their staff in recent years.
Diversity policies and various initiatives to promote diversity, particularly in public service broadcasting, have been developed in Europe since the 1960s. Now in the 2000s there are a variety of strategies to increase representation of minorities and recruitment of journalists with minority background in mainstream media. European collaboration, particularly through EBU and/ or EU finance, is both taking inspiration and ideas from national experiences and disseminating good practices. This is a manifestation of managed multiculturalism, which is clearly becoming a more integrated and professionalized part of European media policy and practice.
In our analysis we are specifically interested in how and for what purposes diversity discourses are used and how cultural/mission and economic/market arguments are articulated in the companies diversity media policies. Policy documents in addition to other related material, such as speeches, preliminary papers, websites and interviews with key people are scrutinized with critical discourse and policy analysis. Media policy is analysed as crystallization of values: it opens a view to current debates on medias role in multicultural societies."

In this paper, I analyze a representative cross-section of diversity management publications addressed to managers, business scholars and MBA students. What assumptions about difference do these publications bring to their prescriptions for diversity? I argue that, to the extent that diversity management publications are characterized by a depoliticized celebration of differences, they do little to displace the symbolic centrality and power of the assumed (middle-class, white, male, heterosexual) norm. Writing as a critical communications scholar recently hired to teach in a business school, I then turn to scholars in GLBT studies and queer theory for conceptualizations of difference that might help teach about workplace diversity issues in ways that do not reify the norm and consign differences to an inferior status."

Specifically, the importance and influence of culture in the physician-patient communication is discussed. The author will discuss problems that emerged in the research process. In conducting this research, expected meanings from the cultural context were lost in translation. For instance, the concept of the Chinese way of giving money to the doctor as ""Red Bag"" is very difficult to translate into English. Another example would be ""relationship"", which has multiple levels of meanings in the Chinese languages and culture. However, when translated into English, it loses its meaning."

While surveys of Australian journalists in the 1990s suggested that large majorities still endorsed the idea of objectivity, a re-examination of earlier qualitative interview data reveals the likely limited and probably already declining influence of the doctrine. Around one fifth rejected the idea of objectivity while the majority were equally split between those who regarded it as an impossible ideal and those who saw it as a routine accomplishment. The most common meanings ascribed to it were the subjugation of opinion, disregard of consequences and impartiality in conflicts. The most common objections to it were among those who equated it with dullness or passivity and those who saw it as an epistemological arrogance. Never, however, when journalists were describing difficult decisions or ethical uncertainties in their work, was objectivity volunteered as a means of resolving them. When examining contemporary decision making, the most notable aspect is the lack of any larger professional ideals constraining practice. While many of the epistemological criticisms were well founded, they not only exaggerated the importance of the doctrine, but to the extent that it influenced practice, they overlooked its virtues such as encouraging an emphasis on accuracy and a defence against the power of both sources and proprietors who wanted to control the news. The contemporary tendency is go with whatever succeeds in the market place, so that journalism becomes anything you can get away with, and perhaps soon analysts will even start to look back on the age of apparent objectivity with nostalgia."

In particular, the researchers aimed to determine whether or not the presence of a code of ethics in the public relations firms in which these practitioners worked influenced their attitudes. When presented with the scenario, practitioners from firms with an ethics code exhibited significantly negative reactions to the behavior portrayed. This study therefore implies that public relations firms should consider establishing an ethics code as a viable means of deterring unethical public relations practices."

A Comparison of Hostile Media Perceptions of News and Late-Night Comedy,"The News: Credibility, Bias, and Mood","Politicians, scholars, and young viewers have been paying increased attention to political content in late night comedy over the past decade. Because young viewers report often learning about political issues from late night comedy, and thus, seem to treat the content as a source of news, the current study examined perceptions of bias in comedy content as compared to those for mainstream, broadcast news. A Hostile Media Effect was found for political content across five comedy shows, with Republican participants perceiving more bias across topics than Democratic participants. Additionally, exposure to news content was found to moderate the effect of political partisanship on perceptions of bias in news and comedy, suggesting that the use of a media bias heuristic explained bias ratings for both types of content."

The major goal of private TV is to profiteer through competing for the largest audience in the market. To entertain is its primary role. Public TV is organized for the pursuit of public interest. Profit-making is not its concern as it does not depend on advertising for revenue. It is supposed to function more like an informer and educator rather than an entertainer. The overarching research question in this paper is: How does ownership affect the gap between private and public TV in news reporting? Using the comparative dataset of the international study, we will examine this gap as manifested in content (news topics), cosmopolitanism (emphasis on international news), emotionality (obsession with conflict and violence), colorfulness (emphasis on personification and human interest), analytical depth (use of backgrounder and length of reports), and balanced reporting (sources of information). We will also examine how the size of the public-private gap may vary in different social contexts."

Three steps will be taken: firstly, the concept of opinion leadership, the PS scale and hitherto research on persons with a high PS-Level will be outlined briefly. Secondly, survey data from German general election campaigns will be used to analyse voting intentions of persons with high PS-Level and the rest of the population. Current research on the recent election of 2005 will examine if the surprising outcome could have been predicted tracking a change of mood amongst persons with high PS-Level. Thirdly, from a long-term perspective, time series analysis will show whether persons with high PS-Level are ahead of the rest of the population or not."

It argued that matches between BIS/BAS and message frames would generate greater efficacy, which would facilitate the generation of pro-message cognition and behavioral compliance. In the investigation of peoples beliefs and behavioral intentions about flu vaccination, the study found less anger, more fear and greater efficacy were correlated with more message agreement and stronger behavioral intention. BIS was significantly associated with anger in the presence of either gain or loss framed message, and significantly associated with fear in the presence of gain framed message. BAS was significantly associated with greater efficacy in the presence of loss framed message."

Background:
The research question in this quantitative second-order cultivation study is two-fold: first this paper studies the influence of watching television on the viewers fear of illness. Secondly, this study focuses on the influence of three different TV exposure measures: the respondents total weekly viewing volume, the genre exposure (exposure to medical drama) and the specific exposure to images concerning medical characters.

Methods:
Data was collected on 1275 Flemish adolescents using a longitudinal panel study. Included were questions on their overall and specific media use, health behaviour and health perceptions and attitudes. An analysis on television content was used in order to link health related content to specific types of television programming. Fear of illness was questioned using a three item scale (α=.96). Three linear regression analyses were performed.

Findings:
Results of the regression analyses show that sex, age and the respondents own health status are significant predictors of the fear of illness. The overall amount of television watched is not related to the respondents fear of illness. However, the exposure to medical drama and the exposure to specific images concerning medical characters are significant predictors of fear of illness in TV viewers (beta is respectively β=.07 and β=.10)."
2009-0420,Do Fans Own Digital Comic Books?: Examining the Copyright and Intellectual Property Attitudes of Comic Book Fans,The Politics of Commercial Culture,,,,Paper,Do Fans Own Digital Comic Books?: Examining the Copyright and Intellectual Property Attitudes of Comic Book Fans,The Politics of Commercial Culture,"As digital comic book consumption (both legal and illegal) continues to rise in popularity, the comic book fan community appears conflicted over the effect that digital scans and files have on the values of reading, collecting and fan identity politics. Historically, ownership of comic texts has been the locus for determining comic fan social capital, but do digital scans hold the same cultural capital that printed comic books hold? Does the dissemination of post-purchased digital scans by electronic means primarily hurt copyright holders through lost sales or help copyright holders through social promotion?
Examining the aftermath of two contentious controversies involving scanned comics, 896 discussion forum posts were gathered and coded for frame analysis. Seeking to understand how fans frame their justification for or against download activities, the work provides insight into the relationship between fan and text.
Consistent with the third wave study of fandom studies, the current work draws insight from the collected sample to draw inferences about how consumers related to popular culture texts in general, as well as distinguishing unique characteristics about comic book fandom owing to their unique text."
2009-0421,Dolly and Van Damme in Malawi,Provincializing Media Studies,,,,Paper,Dolly and Van Damme in Malawi,Provincializing Media Studies,"Malawi has little in the way of a media industry. Local film and television production are strictly limited, with all viewing conducted on small televisions in communal video shows, while local musicians usually require a second job to make ends meet. Usually through pirated means, though, American, Nigerian, and South African media texts abound. Eighties action films, Nigerian soaps, and rap, hip hop, easy listening, and country music predominate. But how are we to make sense of such foreign texts in Malawi? What, for instance, do Dolly Parton, Jean-Claude Van Damme, or Nigerian tales of love and witchcraft mean in Malawi? In 2008, I went to Malawi with these questions, and here will reflect upon the methodological and theoretical issues that intervened, and upon the plurality of questions that supplemented and replaced them."
2009-0422,Do Men and Women Read News Differently? Effects of Story Structure on Cognitive Processing,News and Gender,,,,Paper,Do Men and Women Read News Differently? Effects of Story Structure on Cognitive Processing,News and Gender,"This study explored how the structure of written news affects men and women differently in terms of cognition. Four different news stories were manipulated so that there was an inverted pyramid and chronological version of each. In a 2 (structure) x 2 (story) x (sex) mixed design, participants read two inverted pyramid and two chronological news stories, each on a different topic. Dependent measures included availability of cognitive resources while reading, cued recall, recognition accuracy, text comprehension, and reading enjoyment. Secondary task reaction times (STRTs) were used to measure cognitive resources. Women had slower reaction times than men across stories, but a significant interaction showed their use of cognitive resources was less affected by variations in story structure. These results are discussed in the context of a comprehensibility interpretation of the STRT measure. The findings suggest that the common use of the inverted pyramid structure, which has been criticized as difficult to comprehend, cannot explain the dwindling number of female news readers."
2009-0423,Domesticated Mediatization?,"Mediatization as Keyword Between Civilization, Domestication, Authority, and Media Culture",,,,Paper,Domesticated Mediatization?,"Mediatization as Keyword Between Civilization, Domestication, Authority, and Media Culture","In an increasingly mediatized world, the need to find ways of dealing with media increases. This concerns both users (having to use (or not use) media and appropriate them into everyday life) and societal discourses, but also media researchers wanting to analyse the concrete appropriation processes related to the mediatization meta-phenomenon. One useful concept here is the domestication framework, which combines the media ensemble perspective with notions of social interaction and everyday life. It also offers a sense of the resistances to given structures taking place in everyday life.
However, the domestication concept needs to be updated in order to be directly applied to the mediatization framework. It has been challenged not least in terms of the changing contexts of appropriation processes, but also in terms of its theoretical remit and ethical implications. The paper shall reflect on both the challenges that mediatization offers to domestication as well as what domestication might offer to the more concrete understanding of mediatization processes in everyday life."

Through a reading of some of the programs inceptional discourses alongside an overview of how Habermasian public sphere theory has been developed to account for the liberal capitalist ideology of the mass media, I show that The Views emphasis on diversity and free speech works to elide conflict and domesticate dissent. Discourses of feminism and anti-racism are hardly absent, but are re-figured to affirm liberal capitalist values. Individuals are granted a place at the table, but the possibility for a structural critique of capitalism is severely limited. In this way, the feminized electronic public sphere acts as a hegemonic political mechanism, substituting televisual representation of dialectics for access to an authentic public sphere."
2009-0425,Domesticating Vacations: Containing Sex and Gender in Postwar Magazine Narratives,Popular Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Domesticating Vacations: Containing Sex and Gender in Postwar Magazine Narratives,Popular Communication Poster Session,"The following paper focuses on how popular magazine narratives of the mid-1940s through 1960 invested vacationing with a greater significance by making it part of a larger discourse about consumerism, gender roles, and sexuality. Using historical methods and narrative theory, the study finds that vacation stories commonly hinted at a range of transgressive subjects related to the gender and sexual norms of the era. The carnivalesque aspects of vacationing were tempered, however, by another set of narratives that focused on romantic courtship, trip planning, and shopping. These narratives helped resituate leisure travel within the confines of domesticity and consumerism. Exploring the gendered notions of vacationing during a pivotal era in U.S. history can shed light on how marginalized groups, activities, and ways of being have at times circulated through mainstream discourse and have been weaved into larger consumer narratives."

This paper examines how television presents foreign news in ways that make the issues and events more pertinent and hence more comprehensible to the home viewer. In particular, we will consider the following domestication schemes frequently used by the media: the use of graphic elements such as maps and logos indicating a relationship between where the event took place and the country of broadcast; verbal explicit references to nationals and to impact on the country of broadcast; and the visual presence of actors representing the country of broadcast. Furthermore, we will analyze the correlations between these schemes and some other features of the news story, including the topic of the news, its geographical proximity to the country of broadcast, and threat caused by the nature, scope, or impact of the event."

They now number nearly 400,000 warranting some to call them Taiwans Fifth Ethnic Group. Members of this group of immigrants are commonly referred to as Waiji Xinniang or Foreign Brides. The cultural and semiotic meanings associated with this term are the focus of this study. Data collected from in-depth interviews with foreign born women, their family members, elementary school teachers, and pictures of road side signs advertising Waiji Xinniang are analyzed. Findings demonstrate how meaning is negotiated, and the negative stereotype that since such women are purchased they cannot be mothers, wives, and daughters-in-law like others, is resisted. They also demonstrate that one of the unintended effects of globalization is the struggle for meanings associated with family and gender."

Questions of genre hybridization and authenticity as well as ethics are unraveled in a case study design comprised of four recent Flemish reality series with a border crossing circulation, whereby textual analyses are integrated with the findings of qualitative interviews with program-makers and participants of these series. In doings so, it is argued that contestations of authenticity and ethical dilemmas are being reoriented through the popularization and hybridization of the documentary genre."

The Challenges of Fostering Tolerance via Prosocial TV Programming,Entertaining and Educating Young Children,"A total of 128 children aged 4  6 were randomly assigned to see either an episode featuring a metaphoric example of prejudice (cats are prejudiced toward mice but then learn better) or a realistic example of prejudice (boys and girls fight at summer camp but then learn to get along), these episodes being shown either with or without short explanatory inserts, or to see a control episode unrelated to tolerance. Those who saw the metaphoric prejudice with inserts showed more inclusive attitudes on a subset of measures relative to the control group; those who saw it without inserts did not. Those who saw the realistic prejudice showed less inclusiveness relative to the control group, regardless of whether there were inserts. Childrens interpretations of the content predicted their levels of inclusiveness."

Cultural Identity and Studies of Regulatory Culture,Policy Off Our Backs: Critical Studies of Identity in Regulatory and Policy Cultures,,,,Paper,Do Regulators Have Identities? Cultural Identity and Studies of Regulatory Culture,Policy Off Our Backs: Critical Studies of Identity in Regulatory and Policy Cultures,"Liberal democratic theory privileges the notion of the identity-neutral regulator: the genderless, raceless, classless individual appointed to uphold the enforcement mechanisms for public policies. Yet social movements globally have raised the importance of diversity in civil service and public administration, sometimes forcing government officials to consider identity when making appointments to regulatory commissions. This paper looks at the ways in identity politics are incorporated by proxy through the bodies of regulatory appointees. By drawing off Wendy Browns (1995) insights into the discursive framing of feminist and civil rights claims as injuries, communication scholars could more productively avoid the twin pitfalls that either ignore the identity politics embedded in regulatory cultures or, conversely, reduce identity politics to a question of gender or racial presence on regulatory commissions. To suggest an alternative, this paper offers insights from an autoethnography based on the authors involvement in a regulatory commission of cable television.

Bio: Vicki Mayer is Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Communication, where she researches and teaches media studies. Her second book Below the Line: Television Producers and Production Studies in the New Economy (to be published by Duke University Press) implores scholars to examine everyday peoples involvement in the processes of television production and regulation to unearth their identity politics and labor hierarchies embedded in media studies. She is finishing her term as chair of the Feminist Studies Division in 2009."

An Analysis of Argumentation Style Based on Diffusion Ability,Keywords in Information Systems: Persuasion (High Density),"Boster et al.s (2006) measures of diffusion ability were used to determine if the persuasive attempts of superdiffusers of health information (individuals who are well-connected, persuasive, and knowledgeable about healthy lifestyles) are different from those who are not. In Study 1, 164 undergraduates filled out the measures of diffusion ability. They were then asked how they would try to persuade a target either to lose weight or to avoid smoking. The scenario they were given was either simple or complex. For the Ss who responded to the avoiding smoking scenario a 2 (superdiffuser or not) X 2 (scenario complexity: simple or complex) interaction was found in which superdiffusers who responded to the complex scenario produced more arguments, more overall themes in their arguments, and addressed more elements of the scenario than any of the other three groups. Superdiffusers produced more arguments when they responded to the weight loss scenario. A second study was conducted with 35 Ss who were interviewed about their beliefs on dieting. Their responses were coded for argument complexity. Superdiffusers produced more complex arguments than non-superdiffusers. In total, results indicated that superdiffusers act in ways that would facilitate the effective diffusion of health information."

These factors run an interference pattern on the thinking of many leftists in the West, who have shown little solidarity with Iran's beleaguered labor and human rights movements. While most western leftists stop short of actually sympathizing with the Iranian regime, several have a political soft spot for Ahmadinejad. I will examine this phenomenon using Slavoj iek's notion of the ""double blackmail"": the myopic either/or thinking which convolutes the political complexity on the ground in Iran and betrays the internationalist tradition of the Left. I will look at three examples: (1) the journal New Left Review; (2) MRZine (the online forum of Monthly Review magazine); (3) religious leaders and peace groups which have held a series of meetings with Ahmadinejad over the last two years. I will demonstrate that the arguments of each of these camps are badly disfigured and, although not representative of the Left as a whole, sympomatic of profound problems with key aspects of the leftist project today."

Parental Responsibility vs. the Child's Autonomy in CD Patients' Mealtime Talk",Studies in Language & Social Interaction Research,"This paper examines mealtime conversations among families with a celiac disease (gluten intolerance) patient. Drawing on insights from conversation analysis (CA) and discursive psychology (DP), it focuses on how the tastefulness of the food and its permitted/non-permitted character (in terms of it being gluten-free or not) are made relevant in the interaction, and to what ends. While liking food or not is a private issue, parents also carry responsibility for the child being faithful to a gluten-free diet. We will show that Yes/No interrogatives are drawn upon to manage the tension between parental responsibility and the childs right to self-determination. YNIs in the environment of denying food to the child, allow for conceding epistemic authority but also invite affirmation of a rule as already agreed upon. In addition, YNIs are sequentially positioned as to let the food being accepted in terms of its tastiness (a seemingly private choice) rather than in terms of its allowability."

Various male pundits, politicians, journalists, commentators, and ordinary Joe Six-Packs have referred to Palin through sport and courtship (seduction, sexuality) metaphors such as John McCains reference to her as a Trophy Vice (a play on the term trophy wife) and Rush Limbaugh repeatedly referring to her as a babe. My comments examine how sport and courtship discourses work to construct Palin(man)ia as an articulation of heteronormative masculine desire, or as I call it, dude-ism. In particular I am struck by the display of rows of bare-chested young, white men whose painted torsos show P-A-L-I-N or M-A-V-E-R-I-C-K. These mostly young, twenty-something men engage in political fandom that has its roots in a form of sport performance culture in which men paint their bodies in the colors of their favorite college or professional football teams. I am interested in how the young bare-chested bodies work to yoke sport and courtship which then have the effect of positioning Palin, at 44 years old, as an object of electoral desire for a specific cohort of young white men."

This paper analyzes salvation frames in media coverage of celebrity activism in Africa, specifically the strategic deployment of Christian rhetoric by U2 frontman Bono in his efforts to increase Western aid to Africa. Celebrities ground their actions in the Third World and their advocacy in the United States on the premise that their campaigns influence world leaders and citizens to aid nations that would otherwise be ignored. Bonos speeches and writings, along with news and popular media representations, function to construct the United States as a benevolent Christian nation, which orientalizes Third World nations in contrast."

There are no exceptions in our understanding of citizens responses to political ads. Existing studies on message processing are primarily restricted to static approaches using data collected at one time point or averaged real time data. The proposed Dynamic Motivational Activation Model emphasizes motivational activation as a fundamental factor in information processing, and explains the dynamics of these effects and their interactions with individual political attitudes. They are tested using real time data indicative of emotional and cognitive responses."

From Sarah Silvermans Great Schlep project, to MoveOn.orgs parodic video on talking to your parents about the dangers of voting McCain, to their dystopic tale about Obama losing the election because of you, all present a very real, earnest appeal to action couched in irony and parody. I will examine the way in which organizations on the American political left have mobilized the ironic mode as a means through which to make these appeals, and why earnestness in this form is now often interpreted as somehow more authentic than its more straightforward cousin.

Using Asian hip-hop artists M.I.A. and Panjabi MC as case studies, the tropes used to describe them are compared against the tropes used to describe U.S. hip-hop artists; which indict the politics inherent in crossover and the role of globalization in creating obstacles for the entry of Asian hip-hop artists into the global hip-hop market."

Using Babrow's Theory of Problematic Integration as a conceptual framework, a semi-structured narrative approach was used in interviewing 10 hospital-based nurses about work conflict. The results of this phenomenological study are identified in the following three themes: Managing Overload, Identifying and Negotiating Boundaries, and Substituting and Advocating. An additional theme, Eating their Young, was also discovered and alludes to nurse-peer conflict in the workplace. The results have implications for future research in health and organizational communication and reflect the importance of research into the communication between and amongst nurses, patients, and physicians and the impact of that communication on patient health outcomes. A discussion of findings and suggestions for further research are offered."

This proposition has not often been tested. This research estimated exposure to economic content in electoral campaign advertisements. These estimates were geographically and behaviorally tailored to the respondents to a panel survey of personal financial attitudes. Results were robust and revealing. The volume of election ads (though not the degree to which they were about economics) depresses feelings of personal financial security. Both results were observed in the longer term, but not immediately visible. The effects emerged, or became detectable, over time."

Economic perceptions are an especially interesting case study for communication scholars because both first-hand observations and economic news coverage are available as information sources. It is assumed that news coverage has stronger effects as media dependency grows and the availability of first-hand information declines. Furthermore, media effects are expected on the perception of national economic matters, while the personal environment is observed directly. In order to test these assumptions, a time series analysis of economic perceptions, economic news coverage and real business development in Germany 1998-2007 is performed. The empirical results reveal support for the assumptions. National economic situation and labor market are perceived solely via the mass media; consumer prices via both mass media and first-hand observations; and the personal financial situation mainly via first-hand experiences."

Using data from a nationwide survey of elected officials, the study examines the relationship between elected officials' Internet use in conducting their official duties and their interactions with neighborhood groups, business interests, issue groups, and other groups in civil society. Results show that Internet use is associated with a significant increase in contact with these stakeholders, even after controlling for the issue being debated and the officials' levels of offline communication. However, Internet use is not yet contributing to more substantive influence in policy making. The association between Internet use and use of stakeholder-created resources is non-significant. We discuss the significance of these findings for local politics and government transformation in both the near-term and distant future."

An Analysis of the Availability and Educational Quality of Childrens E/I Programming,Entertaining and Educating Young Children,"This study evaluates how well commercial broadcasters fulfill their legal obligation to serve the educational needs of children by analyzing both the quantity and quality of stations programming efforts. The study content analyzed three episodes of the most widely aired educational series on commercial stations, applying a range of criteria associated with childrens learning from television. The findings indicate that most episodes claimed as educational offer only limited value for children, with only one of every eight (13%) judged as highly educational. In contrast, 23% of programs were rated in the lowest category of minimally educational. The majority of stations (59%) provide only the minimum required amount of three hours per week of educational programming, with only 3% of stations exceeding four hours weekly. For comparison purposes, a separate sample of programs airing on public broadcasting (PBS) was analyzed, and revealed that the educational quality of the PBS shows was significantly greater than that of the commercial stations. In addition, PBS programming emphasized cognitive/intellectual lessons, whereas commercial channels relied largely on social/emotional lessons, such as sharing or getting along with others, as their educational substance. Our findings identify weaknesses in the extent to which commercial broadcasters fulfill their legal obligation to serve the educational needs of children in the U.S."

Methods. A literature search produced 80 studies that met the criteria for inclusion, including use of media, assessments before and after the intervention, and sufficient statistical information to calculate an effect size for at least one outcome.
Overall, media interventions successfully promoted condom use, particularly in nations with a low human development index. Interventions that included both mass media and interpersonal channels (e.g., counseling, peer outreach, small groups) were much more successful (d+=0.45, 95% CI=0.42, 0.48 k=14) than campaigns using only mass media or interpersonal with a small media component (e.g. video, brochure, poster). Interventions worked better when combined with condom distribution, the samples were sexually active, and abstinence was not an intervention goal. Interventions were not successful in reducing the number of sexual partners.
Media interventions should be an important part of HIV prevention and potentially other public health strategies  given their effectiveness, reach, and ability to reduce global health disparities."

Approximately 86% of the 261 participants watched at least one of the 12 video podcasts prior to the examinations. Results indicated that students who viewed the podcasts did not score higher on the test questions related to the videos than their non-viewing classmates. In addition, the scale of video podcast attitudes was the only significant determinant of video podcast use in the hierarchical multiple regression. The other nine independent variables (age, ethnicity, gender, attitudes about the course content, recommended behaviors, and instructor, MP3 player ownership, computer literacy, and podcasting familiarity) were statistically insignificant."

This is understandable given societys concerns about the impact of new technologies on children and adolescents. While the effects tradition has been valuable, we have learned what we can from this perspective. However, more and more evidence supports a dynamic model of the media. This talk will begin with an overview of dynamic systems and their implications for research in the social sciences. Examples will be provided indicating how dynamic systems applies to the issues that communication scholars are interested in pursuing. This section will focus on two issues. First, the importance of considering time as we study different phenomenon will be discussed. Second, the importance of considering levels of influence ranging from cultural level influences to psychological processes. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of meta-theoretical and methodological implications of taking a dynamic perspective."

The interactivity of video games and virtual worlds transcends passive observation and allows participants to engage with responsive, behaving entities. As a result, the effects of sexualized representations may be qualitatively different. This exploratory study examined participants reactions to suggestively and conservatively clad virtual females who exhibited either responsive, high levels of eye gaze or nonresponsive, low levels of gaze. Male and female participants demonstrated different looking behavior toward some of the agents body regions. Outside of the virtual world, participants sexist attitudes and rape myth acceptance were assessed. Both men and women who had encountered a highly stereotypical agenteither the suggestively clad, high gaze agent (vamp) or the conservatively clad, low gaze agent (virgin; Benedict, 1992)demonstrated more sexist attitudes and greater rape myth acceptance than participants who had seen a suggestively clad, low gaze or conservatively clad, high gaze agent. The findings suggest that virtual females who confirm sex stereotypes of virgins or vamps enhance negative attitudes toward women, whereas those that violate expectations and break stereotypes do not."

Forty parent-emerging adult child dyads engaged in divorce-related stressor conversations reported their thoughts about that discussion. Hierarchical regression models indicated that strategic ambiguity predicted lower relational quality and communication satisfaction for emerging adult offspring but not parents. Ambiguity tolerance did not moderate this relationship. These results suggest that specific characteristics of disclosures may help explain how parents stressful disclosures influence offspring. Strategic ambiguity may be a strategy for managing privacy within families."
2009-0452,Effects of Past and Anticipated Guilt on Individuals Health Intentions and Behavior and the Moderating Role of Past Behavior,Messages to Moderate Youth Behavior (High Density),,,,Paper,Effects of Past and Anticipated Guilt on Individuals Health Intentions and Behavior and the Moderating Role of Past Behavior,Messages to Moderate Youth Behavior (High Density),"As a widely used guiding theory for health campaign design, the theory of planned behavior (TPB) has been criticized for focusing on cognitive variables only and failing to elicit emotional responses. The present study examined whether the addition of past and anticipated guilt would predict individuals exercise intentions and behavior under the theoretical framework of the TPB and whether individuals past behavior would moderate the effects of the two dimensions of guilt. Based on a two-wave longitudinal survey of 517 college students physical activity intentions and behavior, results showed that anticipated guilt, but not past guilt, significantly predicted physical activity intentions, over and above the influence of the TPB variables. It was further observed that anticipated guilt was a stronger predictor of intentions for participants who did not regularly participate in physical activity in the past than for those who did. Both theoretical contributions to the TPB and practical implications for health inventions are discussed."

Major research results from CECCR I will be reviewed in: seeking and scanning information about cancer; designing effective anti-smoking messages for adults; and communicating genetic risk. Penns CECCR II expands the focus of CECCR I through its major theme: the interaction of public communication and clinical services as they affect cancer-related outcomes. One project tests whether patient-clinician information exchange during the initial cancer treatment phase is associated with subsequent differences in cancer patient health behaviors, health care utilization, and health outcomes in the first three years after treatment. A second project evaluates the effects of smoking cues in anti-tobacco PSAs on smoking urges, message processing, and smoking behavior in chronic smoking adults. A Message Design Core will help in the selection, design, testing, and evaluation of messages employed in the research projects at Penn and in other cancer-related projects nationally."
2009-0454,Effects of Relational Motivation and Age on Online Self-Disclosure: A Content Analysis of MySpace Profile Pages,Online Dating,,,,Paper,Effects of Relational Motivation and Age on Online Self-Disclosure: A Content Analysis of MySpace Profile Pages,Online Dating,"This study investigates the effects of age and relational motivation (romantic vs. non-romantic) on the amount of self-disclosure on MySpace.com, the most popular social networking website in the United States. One hundred and twenty-one Profile pages were collected and coded for various indicators of self-disclosure. The results indicate that users with romantic relational motives provide more self-descriptions and relational interests on their profile pages and are more likely to disclose information on children and income, but less likely to disclose their sexual orientation, than those without romantic relational motives. Younger users disclose more freely in the open-ended self-disclosure items provided by the site than older users. Finally, no statistical interaction effect between age and relational motives on online self-disclosure was found."
2009-0455,Effects of Self-Efficacy and Response Efficacy in Health News: Changing Health Attitudes and Behavioral Intentions,Health in the News (High Density),,,,Paper,Effects of Self-Efficacy and Response Efficacy in Health News: Changing Health Attitudes and Behavioral Intentions,Health in the News (High Density),"Deaths attributable to modifiable causes continue to rise, and concerns over health are increasingly prominent today moreso than in the past in part because of the growing social burdens wrought by comorbidity, increasing health care costs, and an aging population. Campaigns and interventions are often problematic, but health messages in the news media represent an untapped resource for impacting healthy behaviors, particularly in the context of cancer. The present research investigates how two types of messages, self-efficacy and response efficacy, can influence attitudes and behavioral intentions after exposure to cancer news stories. An experiment (N = 1085 participants) showed that the type of behavior (prevention or detection) had a significant influence on the impact of efficacy messages in the news media. Results supported the mediating role of attitudes on the relationship between efficacy messages and behavioral intentions. The discussion highlights implications for health practitioners, journalists, and the public."
2009-0456,Effects of Sudden Audio Disappearance and Audio Complexity on Attention and Message Recognition,The Best of Information Systems,,,,Paper,Effects of Sudden Audio Disappearance and Audio Complexity on Attention and Message Recognition,The Best of Information Systems,"This experiment uses the limited capacity model of mediated message processing to examine the effects of sudden audio disappearance and audio complexity on viewers attention and message recognition. 59 participants viewed 20 commercials, 10 low and 10 high in audio complexity. Half commercials in each audio complexity category had an audio fragment cut out from them. The participants heart rate (HR) was used as a physiological index of mental effort and attention. Their overall attention was also assessed using a self-report measure. Results showed that compared to HR during messages with continuous audio, sudden audio disappearance elicited greater orienting responses resulting in greater HR deceleration. However, the participants did not report paying greater attention to the messages with sudden audio disappearance. Results showed that the participants paid more attention to the messages low in audio complexity than to the messages high in audio complexity. Self-reported data did not reveal significant difference in attention paid to the two audio complexity categories. The participants reported paying more attention to sudden audio disappearance in the messages low in audio complexity than in the messages high in audio complexity. Recognition memory decreased after sudden audio disappearance and did not recover later. However, recognition memory increased steadily for the messages with continuous audio indicating negative impact of sudden audio disappearance on the message encoding. Unlike what was predicted, the participants recognition memory was better for the messages that were low in audio complexity than for the messages that were high in audio complexity."
2009-0457,Effects of the Media on Intent to Vote,Campaign Effects (High Density),,,,Paper,Effects of the Media on Intent to Vote,Campaign Effects (High Density),"During the 2008 presidential campaign, candidates used every possible media outlet to corral voters. This study examines the extent to which television and the Internet influences individuals political participation, specifically their intent to vote. A self-administered questionnaire of college students on media use, (n=414), shows that television news consumption predicts their intent to vote. However, results also reveal that an increase in television viewing in general decreases the subjects intent to vote. We also investigated the Internet to determine if heavy Internet users, particularly those under the age of 30, were more inclined to participate politically. This study found that Internet usage also predicted individuals intent to vote. In addition, data shows that the use of social networking sites is correlated with watching television news while reading political messages is correlated with reading newspapers. The results of this study reveal the predictability power of television news viewing and Internet use in regards to voting. This study also suggests implications for future research about media, specifically the Internets influence on political campaigns."

However, industrialized and developing nations face considerable challenges in finding workable approaches. This paper reviews the existing research on local e-government and expands it with a detailed examination of China. Reliance on e-government is considered an important component of the national informatization strategy. Using a 44-item instrument, a detailed inventory of the e-government capacities of all Chinese provinces was created. The data reveals that e-government is at an early stage. Information delivery and basic interactional and communicative features dominate. Nonetheless, advanced transactional services or participatory services are also offered. Despite considerable guidance by central government, distinct regional disparities are visible. They can be explained by differences in internet infrastructure, economic resources, and the urbanization rate."
2009-0459,Electronic Communications Between Regulation and Competition Law,"Promoting Open Competition in Networked-Based Content, Applications and Services",,,,Paper,Electronic Communications Between Regulation and Competition Law,"Promoting Open Competition in Networked-Based Content, Applications and Services","There is a perceptual bias against regulation and in favor of competition law in communications. Competition law is often surrounded by an idealized presumption of superiority and predictability that determines the discussions of the shift from sector-specific regulation to general competition law in communications, and spurs its development. This paper argues that the problems within the area of competition law and its enforcement are essentially neglected in these discussions. It highlights some of the criticism and suggests viewing competition law as a form of regulation. This makes it possible to direct emphasis toward the ends instead of solely the means of communications policy-making. The paper in turn concludes that the current debate is not over the choice of a superior or inferior regulatory instrument but one over normative standards and value choices."

Specifically, DUrsos (2006) communication-based model of panoptic effects, the structural-perceptual model (SPM), as well as predictions derived from Snyders (in press) e-mail privacy research are utilized to explore the role of e-mail monitoring/surveillance on employee perceptions of e-mail privacy. Perceived e-mail privacy is conceptualized as a relational construct consisting of employees concerns about their organizations ability to infringe upon their privacy and the employees proficiency at maintaining the privacy of their messages. Analysis of survey data from 251 employees in a wide range of jobs indicated that the two dimensions of e-mail privacy are affected by different predictors, and that the SPM may need refinement."

The long-observed print-based reporting tradition not to identify perpetrators and victims involved in Hindu-Muslim of other group clashes, in order to prevent inflaming passions in other areas, has come under considerable strain as violence is captured live on television. This was evident during the political violence in Gujarat in 2002, when over 1,000 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim clashes. Victims and perpetrators could be easily identified as the violence was carried live across India. Elsewhere, the reporting of insurgencies and identity politics in north-east India has undergone a change. The Internet is providing new avenues for reporting the events and issues of such marginal areas that continue to be symbolically annihilated in the pan-Indian news media that have an agenda-setting role. Together, such trends in reporting small wars and insurgencies in India are likely to lead to undisguised and bold reporting that may add pressure on decision-makers to take quicker action to resolve issues than was the case earlier."

Transformational leadership was preferred by public relations leaders, in which empathy played an essential role. Transformational leadership and empathy were found to be significant predictors of PR leaders competency in gaining employees trust, managing employees frustration and optimism, taking stances toward employees and top management in decision-making conflicts, as well as using extreme influence tactics against problematic managerial decisions."

The Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP: Lang, 2006) offers an explanatory framework for understanding how individual differences in the speed of aversive activation (negativity bias) and resting levels of appetitive activation (positivity offset) influence moment-to-moment motivational activity (emotional response) in response to video game content."

Although regarded as common sense, few public relations research attempted empirical examination of employees communication behavior with external publics. One of the purposes of this research was to examine to what extent the quality of relationships employees have with an organization can predict employees external communication behavior as it relates to organization related issues. Based on literature review in business management, marketing, organizational behavior, and public relations, focal concepts such as micro boundary spanning, megaphoning, employee-organization relationships, and symmetrical internal communication strategies are operationalized. A survey research was conducted with 300 employees in different types of organizations. Results indicated that organizations symmetrical communication efforts were positively associated with employee-organization relationships. It was also found that positive employee-organization relationships led the employees to engage in voluntary boundary spanning roles (positive external communication). We also found negative associations between employee-organization relationships and bad-mouthing behavior (negative external communication) of employees. Detailed discussion of the results, theoretical and practical implications are provided."

The long life of the story is attributed by media to the determination and love of her mother, Beth Holloway, who is often at the center of media coverage about the case. This paper asks how one woman has been so successful in gaining the on going attention of news media that are always searching for a new story, and how that attention translates to currency with investigators and politicians. Using a comparison of the media coverage of hundreds of disappeared Mexican women working in factories along the U.S.- Mexico border, this paper aims to identify the specific strategies employed by mothers of missing women in getting media attention for their daughters and how those strategies depend upon specific cultural ideals of motherhood and girlhood, as well as the global political and economic contexts that frame the women's stories and the reporting on them."
2009-0468,Empowerment Through Endorsement? Polysemic Meaning in Dove User-Generated Advertising,The Politics of Commercial Culture,,,,Paper,Empowerment Through Endorsement? Polysemic Meaning in Dove User-Generated Advertising,The Politics of Commercial Culture,"Against the backdrop of a digital era of mass communication, the wall that once incisively divided media production and consumption is ostensibly collapsing; and in its place rises a culture of interactivity. Not only are consumers increasingly participating in the production of news and entertainment, they are also being strategically incorporated into marketing initiatives. While some scholars and professionals have cited user-generated advertising campaigns as evidence of the newly empowerment consumer, others have emphasized the exploitative labor consumers perform as part of their integration into the production process. This exploitation-empowerment debate becomes increasingly problematic when brought into dialogue with a feminist rhetoric of empowerment, such as that promised in the recent Dove Supreme Cream Oil Body Wash contest, which challenged real women to create 30-second commercials for Doves new line of body washes. In this paper, I examine how issues of power, labor, and leisure were articulated among the various contest participantsthe Dove executives, the amateur commercial producers, and the online audiencethrough interviews, discourse analysis, and observation of the contest website. What emerge from the data are themes of creativity, authenticity, and empowerment that converge and diverge in interesting waysboth within and across groups of participants. Yet, I argue that it is precisely because of the polysemic nature of these themes that the contest was able to simultaneously endorse the product, exploit participant labor, and empower consumers as individuals, as women, and as creative professionals."

The ever expanding body of studies on this topic has revealed a number of explanations for the use of English in advertising. It can be related to the larger marketing strategy of a campaign, to the cultural connotations English carries, or English can be used for creative-linguistic reasons. The current article, however, will present an analysis of four examples of advertisements in which English is used for reasons that have not been discussed in the scholarly literature so far. More specifically, in these advertisements, which intertextually refer to a range of British and American media genres, specific registers of English are used to mark the generic intertextuality of the ads. The analysis, I believe, sheds new light on the use of English in the media, and more particularly on issues such as viewers agency and linguistic superiority."

The paper focuses on 2002 to 2004 because this period documents the height of Lopezs cultural visibility in the music, film, and tabloid industries. It is during the period that Lopez launched her second restaurant and first clothing and perfume line, and began her relationship with Ben Affleck, the popular Academy Award-winning actor. I trace the cultural and social conflicts surrounding the erasures and visibility about Lopez as a celebrity news figure. Celebrity narratives about Lopez illustrate how the Puerto Rican Latina body functions as a sexually desirable, ethnically and racially ambiguous docile body that is threatening to dominant ethnic and racial formations and equally productive within the arena of global popular culture. The contradictions are ultimately disciplined through the gendering and racialization of Lopez outside the boundaries of whiteness and middle-class respectability."

Although young people report seeking sexual health information from magazine sources, little is known about the frequency and nature of nonsexual health information in magazines targeted to teenaged audiences. This content analysis explored the presentation of both sexual and nonsexual health information in three popular teen magazines. Articles were analyzed for the presence of educational health information, personal accounts, statistical evidence, and expert sources. Analyses were also conducted to explore the phenotype and age of models depicted in health story graphics and the extent to which those models depicted threatening visual images. Findings demonstrated that magazines contained a variety of health topics and frequently featured personal stories from other teenagers.The majority of models depicted in the health articles were White teenagers. Implications for effects research are discussed."

This current project extends this stream of research to analyze mass mediated entertainment, China Central Televisions Spring Festival Galas, in the previous 26 years. Based on 475 performances from a skip sample of 13 complete Galas, this study confirmed that there was a pervasive presence of social education content, in addition to the heavy promotion of political propaganda. Among the many dominant values, values related to the Traditional New Year and national pride observed an increased presence in the Galas over the years. Results are discussed in light of the Chinese media environment. Further research implications and limitations are provided."

While many scholars suggest that the Internet is a useful resource for environmentalists and other movement actors, few have studied how or to what degree most movement groups use the Internet. Drawing on alternative media and social movement studies, the study develops a typology of social movement communication, and contextualizes communication expectations in light of the character, culture and scope of national environmental groups. The study finds that the majority of environmental groups did not make use of all the communication function associated with social movement communication, but they did engage in providing information, making lateral linkages, and, somewhat contrary to expectations, action and mobilization. This exploratory work provides comprehensive, baseline data on how an important category of social movement actors use the web, and concludes by considering the implications for current theory."

Attitudes toward persuasion agents can be derived from ones persuasion knowledge and ones worldview, each theorized to be governed by a different processing mode. A persuasion knowledge manipulation and an environmental worldview interacted in their effect on the perceived motives of a fictitious corporation. Judgments of the firms perceived self-interested motives, in turn, predicted participants attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand, and appeared to be associated with lower intentions concerning information-seeking and referral behavior. Implications for the persuasion knowledge model are discussed."

In addressing this epidemic, colleges and universities typically offer conventional intervention programs such as alcohol-abuse prevention education to their students; a number of schools have also implemented the social norms campaign. This paper reports the outcome of a formative research project that aimed at gathering student opinions about what may or may not work for a planned prevention program experiment and a binge-drinking prevention campaign. Specifically, the study applied the typology of theory of planned behavior to assess student perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, perceived norms, perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions associated with episodic high-risk drinking behavior."

This paper addresses that question by returning to the founding decades of the field, from the end of World War II through the 1970s. Focusing on several key institutional places-Columbia, Chicago, Yale, Illinois, and Stanford-this paper will trace the place of religion as both object of study and theoretical resource in U.S. mass communication research. Though religion made some notable appearances in media research during that era (in work by Robert K. Merton, Everett Parker, Daniel Lerner, and James Carey among others), it generally lay at the empirical and intellectual margins. I will sketch both the absence and presence of religion in American media research, as conducted by Jewish- and Christian-born scholars, operating in the contexts of postwar American life."
2009-0478,Equality: The Necessary Key Word in the Political Economy of U.S. Campaign Finance,Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Equality: The Necessary Key Word in the Political Economy of U.S. Campaign Finance,Political Communication Poster Session,"In the 2008 presidential election, Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) became the first major-party candidate to reject public campaign funding since the inception of this system in 1976. Therefore, the issues of race and moneyed communication were prominent, yet contradictory popular notions in the 2008 election season. This is significant because campaign finance, even as it centers on a conceptualization of equality, remains unconcerned with race issues. Thus, the inclusion of race in campaign finance is necessary and the study demonstrates that when included, a race perspective places the issue of equality in campaign finance into sharp relief. Furthermore, even as it centers on a conceptualization of speech, campaign finance remains unconcerned with the operation of money as a form of communication. Therefore, the inclusion of money as communication is also necessary and the study demonstrates that when included, a communication studies perspective clarifies the issue of money as an expression of speech in campaign finance. Accordingly, the purpose of this exploratory study is to interrogate the issue of campaign finance from a critical race and communication studies perspective. To that end, campaign finance is described in consideration of its associated multidimensional axes and the ways they link, diverge and find balance as a conflicted yet cohesive social formation. Therefore, the study employs a discourse-historical method to inform the analysis of campaign finance and to explore the campaign finance reform movement as a viable solution to the inequities in the distribution of power and equality in campaign finance."

While feminists in both countries advocated many changes, the drive for equal rights was prominent in both. Using quantitative content analysis and qualitative critical discourse analysis, I examined the multifaceted ways equal rights were constructed and represented within the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune in the US, and the Times and the Daily Mirror in the UK. Though overall I found a mixture of fragmented and competing discourses, I became interested in the ways in which these now, taken-for-granted rights, were initially opposed by some. It is through this opposition that dominant ideologies surrounding women (and men) become apparent, and thus are worth examining. Therefore, rather than focusing on discourses legitimising equal rights for women (which were hegemonic in all publications except for the Daily Mirror), I will instead focus on the ways in which pro-family members and anti-equal rights organisers constructed equal rights for women as unnatural, bad for women, men and society, and as the harbinger of negative (and unintended) consequences."

The unstable epidermal surfaces of morphing white, light, fair, olive, dusky, tanned, wheatish brown, dark, and black bodies that populate Indias transforming semio-sphere of the last decade bear the forensic traces of competing and colluding signifying forcesracism, individualism, nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and commodity feminism. This papers transnational feminist critique of beautys supple visual economy tracks the polysemic meanings of corporeal lightness and darkness that circulate in Indias recently altered public sphere, meanings that are always articulated within and against historical matrices of power relations. The papers analysis of gender, skin color, and global modernity in multiple connected and disconnected media sitesrepresentational and ethnographicstrives to account for power relations without sacrificing notions of audience agency."

First, the idea of a transitional space is defined as the basis for a transitional network. Next, a review of social network theory and network development positions the idea of social ordering as a result of communication among disparate parties. Finally, a review of existing literature on temporary networks is used to tie the ideas of transitional space and network theory, leading to the development of theoretical propositions for use in future study. Such a study will further understandings of the lifecycle of networks, as well as further network research in areas such as disaster recovery, organizational crisis, and temporary organizational alliances."
2009-0482,Ethical Health Communication: A Content Analysis of Predominant Themes in Public Service Advertisements,Health in the News (High Density),,,,Paper,Ethical Health Communication: A Content Analysis of Predominant Themes in Public Service Advertisements,Health in the News (High Density),"Until recently, communication of health messages has largely escaped ethical scrutiny. Now, a debate engages the public health community with Utilitarian undertones: is it OK to objectify women with sexualized images in order to attract attention? Are cultural stereotypes acceptable in order to promote health messages effectively to targeted audiences? Are graphic or scary images and strong emotional appeals justified in order to drive home an important message? What about appeals to personal responsibility at the expense of social factors? These trade-offs are being discussed in the public health field currently, and public health scholars are calling upon communication ethicists to help them grapple with these issues of message design (Guttman & Salmon, 2004). This study assesses the level of ethically questionable messages in public communication of health information. It narrowed the range of problematic ethical themes from the eight discussed by Guttman and Salmon (2004), to identify the three most prevalent ethical messages in health PSAs. They include individual responsibility and fear in the verbal content, and sexual stereotypes of women in the visual content. The most prominent visual theme was positive emotions, which scholars have not identified as problematic. Concerned practitioners and researchers can now concentrate their efforts on helping the creators of health communications understand the deleterious effects of themes individual responsibility, fear, and stereotyping women.

It is an element of international communication that has the potential to greatly affect how one communicates. As the cultures of the world are increasingly exposed to one another, understanding the significance of ethnocentrism as related to intercultural willingness to communicate and elements of international interaction (i.e., international friendships, travel, and frequency of international contact) become an important process in both interpersonal and organization communication events.
To test the relationships among these three variables, 190 undergraduate students were surveyed using a previously designed ethnocentrism scale, intercultural willingness to communicate scale, and a short set of questions to measure international interaction. The results indicate that there are significant relationships among ethnocentrism (in the context of negative attitudes towards other cultures) and the following: frequency of international interaction, international friendships, and intercultural willingness to communicate. There are also significant relationships between intercultural willingness to communicate and international travel, as well as frequency of international interaction and international friendships."

Strong pressures for change result from the European Commissions state aid policy. This has prompted governance responses from member states and has come to influence the definition and handling of the public service remit, especially with regard to Internet activities of public broadcasters. The European Commission considers the funding of PSB as state aid, subject to certain conditions (e.g., clear remit definition) and incompatible with the common market if it results in distortions of competition. The paper analyzes the current Commissions investigation and decision-making practice on public service financing and the commitments (e.g., public value tests) of various EU member states to assure compliance with state aid rules, the manageability of these measures, and the effects on Internet activities of public service broadcasters."

Using structural equation modeling analyses, we examine the effects of identification and motivation, two constructs central to social cognitive theory, and narrative transportation on viewers' knowledge and behavioral intentions regarding bone marrow donation. In particular, we focused on the interaction between identification, motivation, and transportation in producing the desired effects. Results of structural equation modeling analyses indicate identification influences transportation, transportation influences both knowledge and motivation, and motivation influences bone marrow related behavior. Further, post-hoc analyses suggest that motivation moderates the effects of transportation on knowledge. Identification, transportation, and motivation are all key cognitive processes that, in concert, appear to lead to both knowledge retention and intention to take actions toward becoming a bone marrow donor. The results of this study suggest the relationship between motivation and transportation is more complex than anticipated and requires further exploration."

However, this access is meaningless if individuals are not able to operate and learn from health websites. This inability to maximize use of health websites results from a myriad of barriers including low literacy levels, lack of internet skills, and diverse cultural backgrounds. Unfortunately, most studies evaluating health websites to date have superficially focused on basic design tenets. The few studies measuring other assets of health websites have yielded poor results demonstrating that these websites are not friendly to a diverse array of audiences. In an attempt to launch a robust means to assess the plethora of issues surrounding optimal use of health websites we have developed four evaluation sheets to grade design, literacy, health and information content qualities of health websites."

The study adopts Koreas beef protest in 2008 as an exemplary case for the inquiry, since it has been one of the biggest grassroots protests which derived from the online sphere. The interrelations among a total of 10 variables, Internet use patterns including informational use, financial use, social interactional use, product consumption and entertainment, online social capital including bonding and bridging social capital and social trust, and online and on-street movement participation were examined using the structural equation modeling (SEM). The results suggest that online social trust accumulated by informational Internet use, and online bonding capital accumulated by interactional/contacting Internet use, effectively boost online-based movement and on-street protest participation."
2009-0488,Examining Effective Use of an Interactive Health Communication System (IHCS),Physical and Emotional Health Online,,,,Paper,Examining Effective Use of an Interactive Health Communication System (IHCS),Physical and Emotional Health Online,"This study conceptualizes two modes of online information acquisition within an Interactive Health Communication System (IHCS) based on previous literature on cancer-related information seeking, hypertext studies, and human-computer interaction: (a) media behavior in search of a particular kind of content and information with specific goals and purposes (searching), and (b) media behavior to broadly explore lists and contents from the information environment (browsing). By applying two modes of online information acquisition, this study analyzes within-individual changes in two modes through growth curve/longitudinal trajectory analysis. Specifically, this study presents data on individuals transaction log data as they engage in an IHCS and reports on how individual history of the searching and browsing behaviors change over time and how changes in those behaviors predict their psychological and emotional quality of life during cancer experience.
The result suggested considerable heterogeneity of searching and browsing behaviors across individuals. The finding confirmed the need to test theories of online information seeking that integrates its temporal characteristic by examining within-person variations over time. Second, what the results most strongly say about effective IHCS usage in accounting for various benefits is that it depends on how a patient uses the system. That is, improvements in patient status were linked to her commitment to use CHESS Information services over weeks of time, either through consistency or increase in searching and browsing behaviors."

Because the literature primarily focuses on strategy as planned actions, this paper proposes a new definition of emergent communication strategy as an organizational structure that arises in an interaction between reader/hearer response, situated context, and discursive patterns. The paper develops this definition through the seminal work of Henry Mintzberg (1988) on emergent business strategies and Jeffrey Goldstein (1999) on emergence in organizational complexity theory. Additionally, the paper draws from Kenneth Burke (1945, 1955, 1968) to examine reader response, Burke (1955) and ethnography of communication (Carbaugh, 2008; Gumperz and Hymes, 1972; Hymes, 1962; Philipsen, 1992) to explicate situated context, and discourse analysis to derive discursive patterns. Finally, a sample analysis of a letter issued in response to TA unionization is provided to illustrate the presence and impact of emergent communication strategies in one organizational setting."

This paper also compares the Deaf with a hearing sample to contextually understand their new media use and interability communication. Survey results show that Deaf persons communicate most via face-to-face communication and mobile devices. Deaf online and offline communicative behaviors were significantly related, suggesting that their Internet use facilitates existing proximate relationships. Several digital divides were identified and findings point to future research implications to better understand mediated communication of persons with hearing disabilities."

This paper examined two determinants of efficacy judgmentsskill and motivationand tested the effectiveness of these components as messages variables. Study 1 identified the common health behaviors that young adults perceived themselves as unable to perform, as well as barriers and facilitating factors related to performance. Study 2 isolated one behavior, exercise, and tested messages designed to promote exercise by targeting either the skill or motivation subcomponent of self-efficacy. Findings showed that matched messages engendered greater general self-efficacy to exercise than unmatched messages, though there were no significant differences on self-efficacy magnitude and strength measurements. A similar pattern emerged for motivation to exercise. Follow-up data indicated that participants deficient in the motivation subcomponent exercised more than those in the time-barrier group regardless of the message they received in the laboratory."

Most of previous studies, however, utilized cross-sectional data. As a result, there is limited empirical evidence suggesting that subjective well-being is causally related to sense of relatedness. The purpose of the present study is to examine the causal direction between subjective well-being and sense of relatedness with an autoregressive cross-lagged modeling. The basic idea of the autoregressive cross-lagged modeling is quite similar to that of the traditional cross-lagged correlation analysis, but autoregressive cross-lagged modeling with latent variables overcomes the methodological limitations of the traditional method. This study examined a set of longitudinal data consisting of three waves of panel surveys on 458 freshmen students during their first semester at the college, when they are supposed to adapt to a campus life in an unfamiliar environment. The results showed that there was a significant influence from subjective well-being to relatedness rather than from relatedness to subjective well-being. This presentation will focus on statistical methods, especially regarding structural equation modeling for determining causal direction through a set of longitudinal data."

Results suggest the strategy employed by an organization during times of crisis does impact public perceptions of the organization  public relationship and CSR. The strategy also influences if the audience deems the source as credible. The strategies organizations should employ to maintain their relationship and perceptions of CSR are corrective action, reduce the offensiveness, and mortification. These are also the best sources to use if an organization wants the source quoted in the story to appear more credible."

A within-subjects experiment was conducted to examine how valence (positive and negative), sex (not sexy, sexy), and humor (not humorous, humorous) in 32 television advertisements influence motivational activation, encoding, and cognitive effort. Post-auricular (PA) reflex magnitudes, used as a psychophysiological indicator of appetitive activation, were generally found to increase with positive content (positive valence, sex, and humor) during television advertisement viewing. Audio recognition sensitivity, used to indicate thoroughness of encoding, was found to be higher for negative, humorous, and negative humorous (coactive) advertisements, but lower for sexy ads. Tonic heart rates, used to measure cognitive effort, were found to be slower (indicative of greater cognitive effort) during advertisements with negative, sexy, and/or humorous content."

This project examines how the use of several keywords regarding identity negotiation, construction, and representation of African-Americans enhances communication research by allowing studies to use research from several fields. At the same time, increasing the breadth of communication scholarship creates difficulties in defining and using keywords for various forms of methodological and paradigmatic inquiry. Extant research regarding gendered African-American identity in various contexts elucidates these tensions. The keywords of race, ethnicity, culture, accommodation, and acculturation (among others) become conflated and defined in multiple ways. Scholars researching African-American female and male identity must work across these constructions within the field of communication, such as in intercultural communication, organizational communication, rhetoric and mass-communication. Further, they must work across external disciplines, such as womens studies and African-American studies. In addition to examining past research, the presenters discuss how they negotiate these tensions in their current studies."

The present study examines the influence of type of teasing and outcomes on motivations for teasing. Undergraduates were randomly assigned to report personal incidents when they engaged in teasing that was either successful or unsuccessful in achieving prosocial or antisocial outcomes. Results indicated that type of teasing and outcome interacted to influence strategic and self-centered motivations for teasing. Study limitations and future research directions are discussed.

The thesis tests three hypotheses about the relationship between dominance of the news media, proximity of news events to the U.S. interests, and position of the news links on portals front pages and result pages. The study analyzed 34,277 news items from 1,200 pages retrieved in 60 days in 2006 and 2008.

The descriptive data show four major trends: 1) Google News and Yahoo News differed significantly in media inclusion on the front pages, with Yahoo relying on a very limited number of media outlets; 2) the two portals also differed significantly in media inclusion on result pages; 3) both news portals increased the proportion of major media and decreased that of non-major media between 2006 and 2008; and 4) for both news portals, the distribution of media outlets was heavily skewed, with very few media outlets used hundreds of times during the studies period while the majority used only a few times. None of the three hypotheses are fully supported.

These findings advance the understanding of the traditional gatekeeping notion in the Internet context. They also challenge the network gatekeeping theory regarding the role of the gated relative to the gatekeeper, and caution against any sweeping generalization about news portals as a single entity."

This study examines impact of news about polls in the 2008 Taiwan presidential election from a third-person effect perspective. Results of a survey using a random sample of 1,079 college students indicate that they perceived news about election polls to have a greater effect on others than themselves regardless the effects were perceived as negative or positive. Furthermore, findings show that attention to election poll news enhanced the perceived positive effects on self and others. In addition, poll credibility was found to be linked to perceived effects on self and others. The less credible elections polls were thought, the larger the self-other perceptual gap. Finally, concern about the negative effects of election poll news on others was found to trigger protective behavior. However, perceived positive effects of such news on self resulted in discourse engagement about the election."

Mediated content analysis shows that athletic success achieved by African Americans is most commonly attributed to athleticism (Rada, 2005; Whannel, 1992), whereas success for White athletes is attributed to hard work and intelligence (Brillel, 1989; McCarthy & Jones, 1997). Until now, media researchers have yet to seriously consider if these presentations lead to stereotypical attitudes and associations on the part of sports viewers. This study used a unique version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (Greenwald et al. 1998) designed solely for the purpose of this study. To test the association strength of specific stereotypes that were of interest, this IAT was designed with words that are commonly associated with White and African American athletes. This specific IAT was used in conjunction with a survey that measured the average amount of sports and sports-related mediated programming to which an individual is exposed. Across all subjects a preference for Whites associated with smart athlete words and Blacks associated with natural athlete words was found. When separated, light sports viewers had an average D score =.26 and heavy sports viewers had an average D score =.71 (D score is derived from IAT results). These D scores suggest a small relationship for light sports viewers and strong relationship for heavy sports viewers. Further, results suggest there is a significant positive correlation with the amount of sports programming a participant watches and their D score."

Virtual worlds have paved a new and important channel for user collaboration and information sharing. Motivated by this phenomenon and drawing upon prior studies on technology acceptance and adoption, this paper describes a pilot study to investigate the role of cognitive absorption, the state of deep involvement or holistic experience, in the adoption and acceptance of virtual worlds for collaboration and sharing of ideas. In contrast with previous studies, our proposed research model, grounded in literature on technology adoption, trust and social cognitive theory, explores environmental factors like user trust and familiarity as key factors affecting cognitive absorption other than the individual factor of perceived playfulness in the context of virtual worlds. Previous IS literature has researched cognitive absorption, but to our knowledge, the current research is the one of the first few studies that brings the concept of social cognitive theory to further explore cognitive absorption in the context of virtual worlds. Our findings confirm cognitive absorption as a strong correlate of usefulness and ease of use of virtual worlds which eventually leads to adoption intentions of virtual worlds. This is on-going research. Future studies involve more participants in different domains to gather deeper insights and wider knowledge on the factors affecting adoption intention of virtual worlds."

The present study examines the role of efficacy appeals and their relation to feelings of fear and guilt, and results reveal that efficacy appeals triggered fear and guilt. Consistent with our hypotheses, guilt was associated with a perceived threat to freedom. In turn, a perceived threat to freedom was positively associated with psychological reactance, which was positively associated with a boomerang effect. Against expectation, fear was positively associated with reactance. Also, both fear and guilt were negatively associated with a boomerang effect. Implications for efforts aimed at encouraging HIV testing among young adults are discussed."

Findings indicate that overall there is no advantage to utilizing narratives from the perspective of an organ donor, recipient, or person on a waiting list. In general, all three frames effectively (a) reduce state reactance and perceived manipulation and (b) bolster attitudes, intentions to become a potential donor, and favorable source appraisals. Furthermore, the freedom-restoring postscript yielded responses more favorable to donation than the freedom-threatening postscript. In addition to examining main effects for each frame and postscript, we explored whether trait reactance and issue involvement moderated the effectiveness of these message features. Results are discussed with an emphasis on message design strategies for practitioners."

By reviewing and evaluating major theories of managerial leadership, the researchers argued for the necessity of defining the construct of ""excellent leadership"" in public relations. Despite the prevailing pattern of segmentation in research on leadership and on public relations over the past 20 years, the researchers proposed an integrating conceptual framework that encompasses each of the important dimensions relevant for leadership effectiveness in public relations. The conceptual framework is based on the assumption that leadership effectiveness can be mediated by a core set of organizational structure and culture but be universally endorsed. Dimensions that have been incorporated into this integrating conceptual framework include self-dynamics, ethical orientation, relationship building, strategic decision making, and communication knowledge management. Theoretical implications of this integrating conceptual framework are discussed."

It was expected that exposure to these favorable images would promote more favorable evaluations of Latinos among White consumers. Results indicate that exemplar and prototype-based processing of positive race-related media content (both alone and in combination) can positively influence consumers perceptions of target racial/ethnic groups.

Specifically, we first seek to uncover the most prevalent behavioral beliefs that play a role in attitude formation surrounding voting for a land preservation millage. We then test the proposition that including outcome-relevant involvement as well as descriptive and injunctive norms as additional predictors of behavioral intent will better predict behavioral intentions to vote for or against the millage than the original constructs of the TRA alone. Results uncover the most significant behavioral beliefs associated with the millage and indicate that injunctive norms add more to the predictive power of the model, but descriptive norms and outcome-relevant involvement do not."

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork we describe the personal experiences of teenage adopters of mobile phones. Hagerstrand's notion of 'time/space compression' is a common refrain for ICT research, yet for these teenagers while technology did change their relationships with time and space, it did so in more subtle ways. ICT technology acted more as a way of coping with their existing stretched social and material relationships, rather than as an enabler of change. We document how the teenagers used ICT stay in touch with their immediate families, maintain their friendship networks, and envision their life trajectory. The observations are grounded within the social, economic and physical geography of the village."

Political communication research has not addressed these critiques as well as it might, with too many scholars relying on ecologically invalid experimental studies or structural equation modeling of cross-sectional data as the basis for making claims about effects. I contend that a focus on explaining processes should displace a concern with predicting outcomes, though this shift need not mean abandoning the concept of effects. Instead, advances in methods, design, and analysis have put communication researchers, especially those concerned with politics, in a unique position to examine media influence. More complex experimental studies, multi-wave panel surveys, and full network studies of reception and expression are adding to the fields ability to explore actual and perceived effects of mass media."

A theoretical model for the production of sensational television news was proposed hat generated explanations at both country and broadcaster levels. Differences in degree of competition, journalistic culture, media policy, type of broadcaster and target group were identified as possible explanatory factors for the use of sensationalism in the news. Dutch, Flemish, Walloon, and French evening newscasts of both public service and commercial broadcasters were content analyzed in order to test the theoretical model. The analysis made clear that level of competition, journalistic culture, and type of broadcaster are important factors to explain sensationalism in television news. However, the way in which these factors influence the extent of sensationalism in news remains partly unclear. Hence, the theoretical model presented may be considered as a starting point for further cross-national research on sensationalism in television news."
2009-0509,Explicating and Applying Boundary Conditions in Theories of Behavior on Social Network Sites,"lf Presentation, Representation, and Affiliation",,,,Paper,Explicating and Applying Boundary Conditions in Theories of Behavior on Social Network Sites,"Self Presentation, Representation, and Affiliation","Theories of computer-mediated communication (CMC) often fail to posit and test theoretic boundary conditions. This study began by explicating the boundary conditions shared by theories of taste performance, identity warranting, and social capital formation on social network sites (SNS). A random sample of new MySpace users (N = 365) was tracked to determine how frequently these boundary conditions were satisfied. Results indicated that the majority of new users either soon abandoned their profiles or revisited them only infrequently. In addition, the vast majority of MySpace users took advantage of few, if any, of 18 different options for profile personalization. Finally, the majority of users did not list friends or receive comments from others during the six-week study period. These findings imply that theories of taste performance, identity warranting, and social capital formation can be applied to only a minority of MySpace users. Limits and directions for future research are discussed."

In an attempt to strengthen the conceptual foundation for the emerging research field, the current study examines existing media stereotype research from the perspective of intergroup processes and synthesizes it with the intergroup contact theory. To do so, each research tradition was examined first, followed by a new conceptualization of mediated intergroup contact enabled by media texts. Afterwards, the psychological processes of mediated intergroup contact were explicated by applying and further expanding the existing intergroup contact theory. Critical assessments of the US mainstream media, ethic media, and international media were made to illuminate the ways that these media outlets can enhance the outcomes of mediated intergroup contact. Toward the end, a few recommendations were put forward for future research and practice."
2009-0511,Exploratory Analysis of Photographic Imagery as Used in Irish Printed Daily Newspapers,Media Representations,,,,Paper,Exploratory Analysis of Photographic Imagery as Used in Irish Printed Daily Newspapers,Media Representations,"The purpose of this study is to examine visual representation of our society in the news sections of Irish printed daily national newspapers and to analyse the power distribution that traverses these images for evidence of hegemonic tendencies. There are a small number of American studies of newspaper visuals similar to this one, but this study will fill a gap in the literature on Irish newspaper photography. Power is part of the fabric of our society and can be a destructive force when those without power suffer restricted freedom. The mass media play a pivotal role in the discourse of power relationships, in particular through visual representation, building up an impression in societys psyche about how to think about the other. When a group is repeatedly represented in a certain light, these images establish the dominant thinking on this group and may even sufficiently influence the group itself, compelling them into a particular pattern of behaviour. At the core of this study is the argument that, by portraying groups repeatedly in certain ways, either negatively or positively, the media may be advancing and normalising dominant ideologies which tend to benefit the already wealthy and powerful. Through an extensive content analysis of the photographs in the news sections of a cross-section of Irish daily newspapers, this study uncovers evidence that supports the hypothesis that press photographs in Irish printed newspapers support a dominant patriarchal ideology by collectively under-representing and marginalising females."
2009-0512,Exploring Expertise in Gaming: A Self-Determination Approach,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,,,,Paper,Exploring Expertise in Gaming: A Self-Determination Approach,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,"We examined gaming motivation in relation to persistence. Gamers are seen to take enormous efforts in order to finish playing a video game, or level, even in the face of insufficient reward. The current study is embedded in a motivational framework, namely Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Our research question focused on exploring how previous gaming experience, or expertise, is related to persistence in playing video games while taking the psychological needs (competence, autonomy and relatedness) and regulation modes (intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, external regulation and amotivation) as defined in SDT into account. Previous studies (Ryan, Rigby & Przybylski, 2006) have shown that a relation between expertise, needs satisfaction and persistence exists. Our results, however, illustrate that the inclusion of the regulation modes yields a more refined and coherent application of the theoretical framework underlying the model as compared to when they are left out."

Dervins Micro-Moment Time-Line Interview, informed by Sense-Making Methodology, was employed to conduct qualitative interviews with 43 doctors and nurses around their experiences (sometimes shared) of working with challenging patient cases. The emphasis of the analysis was to identify and characterize gap-bridging strategies."
2009-0514,Exploring Product Category Effects: The Interplay of Crisis Responsibility Attributions on Attitudes Toward the Organization and Purchase Intention,Top Student Papers in Public Relations,,,,Paper,Exploring Product Category Effects: The Interplay of Crisis Responsibility Attributions on Attitudes Toward the Organization and Purchase Intention,Top Student Papers in Public Relations,"Even though an array of research on crisis communication has been conducted, relatively little attention has been devoted to the attitudinal and behavioral consequences of public perceptions of crisis responsibility. The purpose of this study is to test a model to explore how product category affects the relative magnitude of associations between attributions of crisis responsibility, attitudes toward the organization, and purchase intention using structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings of this study show that when the crisis involves an organization with high product attributes (e.g., computers), people are more likely to produce strong negative attributions of crisis responsibility that lead to negative attitudes toward the organization and diminished purchase intention compared to crises involving societys well-being (e.g., food). In addition, this study suggests new research directions on understanding crisis variables such as perceptions of crisis responsibility that have a direct impact on behavioral outcomes."

Concerns over viewings of shows produced in developed nations, in developing, less powerful weaker nations have inspired many papers on cultural studies. While there are many studies done on American programming, and various audiences around the world, there is a paucity of research on Pacific audiences. This paper attempts to take a step in that direction by studying the cultural and social impact of Shortland Street, a night time soap opera produced in New Zealand through a focus group interview in a neighboring nation that claims one of the largest and oldest following of the show. Findings reveal that although considered a developing country, the audiences, now exposed to much of global television are aware of their negotiations with the media texts, thus defying the one directional view of cultural imperialism."
2009-0516,Exploring Some Antecedents of the Medias Framing of Election News,Framing and Framing Effects (High Density),,,,Paper,Exploring Some Antecedents of the Medias Framing of Election News,Framing and Framing Effects (High Density),"Despite the major importance of the news medias election news coverage, there are still only few cross-national studies on how the media cover elections. There are even fewer that include both newspapers and television news, and that probe possible antecedents of how the media frame politics in their election news. Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to compare the media framing of election news in two countries  Belgium and Sweden  that both belong to the democratic corporatist model of media and politics. The study focuses on the importance of media channels (TV vs. newspapers) and media type (commercial vs. public service TV and quality newspapers vs. newsstand tabloids) in understanding the medias framing of election news."
2009-0517,Exploring the Association Between Physical Attractiveness and News Coverage: Correlational and Experimental Evidence,Patterns in News Sourcing,,,,Paper,Exploring the Association Between Physical Attractiveness and News Coverage: Correlational and Experimental Evidence,Patterns in News Sourcing,"Media scholars have long ago argued that television news journalists prefer physically attractive interviewees and news subjects (Postman, 1986). While this argument is in line with ample psychological literature documenting the important role of physical attractiveness in a variety of domains, the hypothesis that physically attractive people are more newsworthy has not been empirically examined to date. In this paper, this hypothesis is developed and tested. In Study 1, the effect of the physical attractiveness of members of the Israeli parliament (N = 115) on the amount of their news coverage was explored, while controlling for potentially intervening factors. Results demonstrated that all else being equal, more attractive MKs received more coverage. In Study 2, news sources' physical attractiveness was experimentally manipulated, and the impact of this manipulation on journalists' (N = 53) subsequent evaluation of news value was measured. In two out of five cases, journalists ranked the physically attractive source as more newsworthy."
2009-0518,Exploring the Digital Aesthetic,"Putting the Aesthetic Back Into Communication, and Vice Versa (Cross Unit)",,,,Paper,Exploring the Digital Aesthetic,"Putting the Aesthetic Back Into Communication, and Vice Versa (Cross Unit)","If we are to invoke the term aesthetic in a sense that harkens back to its roots in the Greek word for sense perception, we might use it to describe a unique way of organizing our experience of the world. Keeping this in mind, this presentation explores the relationship between digital artworks composed or performed online and the historical moment in which they emerge. Internet art provides a fruitful vantage-point for thinking about new technology because it can reflect upon the social significance of the medium itself. Catalogues of digital artworks repeatedly invoke one or another of the themes of new media: their ability to foster a sense of virtual community, to create virtual worlds, to enable long-distance collaboration, or to discern patterns in incomprehensibly large amounts of data. This presentation draws upon several examples of online artwork to propose some provisional elements of this aesthetic, including digital autonomy, digital mimesis, and interactivity."

While this challenge is often glossed over by researchers and practitioners as they accept the stuff of their collections as information, Dervins Sense-Making Methodology (SMM) directly confronts this challenge and has been a major contributor to understanding what information is in context and in shaping communication systems to support gap bridging. This paper explores setting SMM into motion to understand more deeply how people create, shape, and make information over time."

We examined the news information presented about the HPV vaccine in major U.S. newspapers over the 19 months following its FDA approval. We also explored the way this information was framed, the sources cited, and the presence of personal examples. A content analysis of 547 newspaper articles revealed that less than half of the articles provided detailed information about HPV or the vaccine. Of the articles that contained a message frame, cancer prevention was most frequently employed. Government/political sources, medical doctors, and the CDC were the most commonly cited sources. Finally, we found that only 16% of all the articles we sampled contained personal accounts."

Individual learners seek and obtain different gratifications during media educational activities. Need for cognition influences cognitive involvement and this in turn leads to heightened learning outcomes. This mechanism is first described in a comparative case study. In this, qualitative observations illustrate how three different media educational environments invite similar types of response. Second, an additional within-case analysis quantitatively evaluates which participants learn most during media educational practices. Overall, the data suggest that learning outcomes are best explained by individual needs. Subsequent research should ask why participants have different dispositions towards media educational contents and strategies."
2009-0522,Exploring the Sequential Nature of Humor in Task Groups,Current Research on Organizational Groups and Teams,,,,Paper,Exploring the Sequential Nature of Humor in Task Groups,Current Research on Organizational Groups and Teams,"This study examines the role of humor in task groups. Although past research on this topic is somewhat limited, investigative efforts suggest humor can have both positive and negative characteristics, and often occurs in episodes. An exploratory analysis of humor was conducted on fifty-nine work group discussions from three German industrial enterprises. The interaction data were coded with the Advanced Interaction Analysis (act). coding system. After determining the frequency of humor in these groups, lag sequential analysis results showed that humor begets humor and laughter serves as a conjoining response in humor-initiated episodes. Findings confirmed the double-edged nature of humor (i.e., humor-initiated episodes exhibited both positive and negative characteristics). Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

Based on media theories such as agenda-setting, priming, and framing, this study uses data from dozens of poll questions on and federal outlay for the environment in 43 years (1965-2007), and content analysis of newspaper articles, television news program summaries and presidential documents in 28 years (112 quarters, from 1980 to 2007). It finds that the media are influenced by the presidents while influencing the public as well as that the media are influenced by the public and that the media influence the presidents. The study also supports the idea that media effects should be analyzed at different levels, as proposed in the integrated mass communications process model. Finally, the presidents and their policies on the environment are found unresponsive to public opinion."
2009-0524,Expressing the Self Through Sentiment: Working Theories of Authentic Communication in a Commercial Form,The Politics of Commercial Culture,,,,Paper,Expressing the Self Through Sentiment: Working Theories of Authentic Communication in a Commercial Form,The Politics of Commercial Culture,"Greeting card sentiment is a genre that is frequently critiqued for being superficial, trite, and representative of how consumer culture deskills the masses. The model of the best form of communication underlying critiques of greeting cards draws on an expressive individualist perspective that privileges unique, creative, spontaneous expression. In contrast, ritual theories of communication emphasize that using public codes and forms can bring certainty and a sense of being connected to something larger than oneself. I argue that how we understand communicative authenticity is significantly classed in Western culture, such that those with high cultural capital are more likely to subscribe to an expressive individualist view of authenticity, while those with low or less cultural capital are more likely to perceive authenticity through a ritual perspective. I illustrate this point by answering the question: what makes a greeting card - a mass-produced sentiment available to anyone - personal to consumers? Drawing on interviews with fifty-one people, I show that high cultural capital consumers are more likely to see the cards they send as an opportunity for displaying their aesthetic taste and for creative self-expression, through the words they compose on the card. In contrast, a common approach for consumers with less cultural capital focuses less on opportunities for creativity, and more on the sociality of cards, as well as the way pre-printed sentiments can evoke and communicate feelings. This approach emphasizes the connective qualities of culture rather than how it functions as a resource for distinction."

Advocates say information found online fills a health care void, and blogs have been promoted as a tool to help cancer patients cope with their illness. This content analysis of cancer blogs generated a portrait of cancer bloggers: primarily middle-aged women whose posts detail in a diary-like fashion their interaction with doctors, their treatments, and symptoms. Although they may express their fears, they also remain generally upbeat and determined to fight their illness. Family and friends figure prominently in entries. Blog posts are heavily viewed but the online community offers little feedback, which raises questions about the extent and effectiveness of blogs as means for dialogue among cancer patients."

We recruited a total of 48 men from online listservs devoted to disseminating information about TC. Participants were given pre-test assessments of mental health, quality of life, and sexual health. The manipulation consisted of three consecutive 20-minute writing sessions in which participants were asked to write about the best experience associated with TC (positive expression), the worst experience associated with TC (negative expression), or an innocuous topic (comparison). Afterward, all participants were given a post-test assessment with the same measures used in the pre-test. A total of 28 men completed at least two writing sessions and were included in the analysis. Results revealed that, compared to men in both the negative expression and control conditions, men in the positive expression group experienced improvements in their mental health over the course of the five-week trial."

The spread of information communication technologies (ICTs) in this regions rural areas suggests the potential of technologies to enhance recovery efforts. While many ICT initiatives have been implemented to aid disaster management, from providing early warning to immediate relief, there exists a gap in the theoretical understanding of the role of technologies in disaster recovery and rehabilitation. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding the implementation of ICTs in recovery operations, drawing attention to vulnerability reducing potential of the initiatives. We review theories on ICT use in disaster management, and propose the Extended Technology-Community-Management model focusing on vulnerability assessment for the design and implementation of ICT programs for development in rural areas. We illustrate this model using case studies from ICT deployments in post-disaster Asia, particularly India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and China, and suggest implications for theory and practice."

Psychophysiological and self-report instruments were utilized to measure arousal, negative emotional experience, attention and recognition. The results indicated that viewers were more aroused by watching highly sensational stories than not sensational stories. Highly sensational international stories elicited greater arousal and negative emotional response. Participants paid more attention and better recognized international stories compared to national stories. Highly sensational international messages elicited higher allocation of resources to encoding. Participants indicated conservative criterion bias for highly sensational national stories during the recognition test. Findings of this study suggest that factors of sensationalism and proximity work well together to make news informative and memorable. As predicted, sensational features elicited greater cognitive and emotional responses; proximity factor indicated reversed effects."
2009-0529,Extreme Members and Group Polarization,cial Influence Processes in Interpersonal Settings,,,,Paper,Extreme Members and Group Polarization,Social Influence Processes in Interpersonal Settings,Participants rated their opinion about the decriminalization of marijuana on a 1 to 9 scale and then discussed the issue in three person groups. Group members who used more extreme ends of the scale to rate their opinion talked more and took more turns. Groups did polarize on their consensual opinion from the mean of individuals pre-group opinions. Groups containing a more extreme member did not polarize more than groups not containing an extreme member. No differences in polarization were found between groups in which members were in consensus coming into the discussion and groups containing a minority and majority opinion.

While many countries employ similar laws to those adopted by the Israeli system in which political parties are allotted free campaigning slots on radio and television that are proportionate to their representation in parliament, Israeli law differs from other legal systems that regulate electioneering speech in two main features: The first, now defunct, was a prohibition on the broadcasting of portraits of candidates and the sounding of their voices during the period leading to the elections; and the second, still intact, is a comprehensive ban on electioneering during the regular programs over the broadcast media. We contend that misinterpretations and miscomprehensions of the Election Law have led to a series of misguided rulings and amendments that, in turn, have created a chaotic system in which the rules of, and the borderline between, the permissible and the forbidden are unclear; while the forbidden is perceived as dead letter, the permitted seems at times to be unrestricted. As a result, we argue, there is growing skepticism about the efficacy of the electoral campaigning system as a whole, fostering extreme proposals for reform including proposals that would lead to an outcome we believe is undesirable: the full abolition of regulation of electioneering speech during election times, as is evident in at least three pending legislative initiatives in the Knesset that voted to disperse in October of 2008. We therefore offer an alternative approach."

Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,,,,Paper,EyeTracking the News: The Report of EyeTrack 07A Study of Print and Online Reading,What You See is What You Get? Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,"How much do readers read  in both the printed and the online version of a newspaper?
This paper explores the answer to that question by reporting the results of a study conducted by The Poynter Institute for Media Studies in 2006 in which 600 readers (200 reading broadsheet newspapers, 200 reading tabloid newspapers, 200 reading newspapers online) were studied using the latest technology in eye tracking equipment to determine how much they read and to examine their behavior in how they navigated through information in newspaper and in news online. Readers read the newspaper or news website for 15 minutes while the eye tracking equipment measured what they read, how much they read, what they looked at first, second and third on each page or screen, and how many elements they observed. With almost 300 variables measured, the data provided a rich foundation to study similarities and differences between reading and navigating through information in print and online.
The study reveals what elements attracted the most visual attention or eye stops. Among the variables studied: Headlines, photographs, informational graphics, lead stories, centerpiece stories, regular news stories, briefs, columnists, fact boxes, alternative story forms and much more. Stories in print and online were measured so that a precise count of how much text was read could be calculated. All results were compared to determine similarities and differences between print and online reading. The most important finding in this study was that readers read more story text online than in print. This paper reports the details of the findings of the entire study.
All 600 readers who were tested in the eye tracking study participated in comprehension/prototype part of the study. After they were eye tracked reading the real newspaper in print or online, they were asked to read one of the comprehension prototypes. Each reader read the prototype for five minutes and then took a five-minute test that contained factual questions about the stories. The results showed that alternative story forms and display worked better to help people remember facts about a story."

Amid attempts to figure out the source of political disengagement among young Americans, the media malaise thesis is oftentimes invoked to link this worrisome phenomenon to the emergence of digital media. Of especially great concern to parents and social observers alike, is the overnight popularity and lasting appeal of many social networking sites (SNS) among young people. But on the other hand, the 2008 presidential election has been making many interesting innovative applications of SNS. This study is a preliminary exploration of whats actually taking place on the presidential candidates Facebook pages. Fan democracy provides a new but provocative concept for looking at young peoples engagement in SNS in a politically relevant sense. Instead of rushing to the conclusion that its another front where young people are engaged in illusional social connection, results from this study suggest more is going on in SNS, and more research should look into such potentials."

The social psychology theory of face-ism was used to measure the head-body ratio of men and women. Results show that men were significantly higher in facial prominence than women, which suggests that social gender stereotypes are internalized by individuals and influences their choice of photographs. However, African-American men showed a higher facial prominence than Caucasian men, which is a deviation from past research findings. The study shows that gender stereotypes still exist despite the self-selection ability of users."

Lists are positioned here as discriminatory instruments for managing and policing high-risk milieus of circulation by acting as mechanisms and signifiers for identifying, limiting and containing the mobility of dangerous objects. This analysis reveals that no-fly list security arrangements deployed under the auspices of the war on terror are constructed on technoscientific language and practices surrounding data-mining, risk assessment and global surveillance infrastructures and networks. Given that the misidentification of normal people on no-fly lists through technoscientific error is a rampant story in media reporting, this analysis also reveals that the truth of the efficient and effective policing of high-risk milieus of circulation, like airports, through the discriminatory logic of lists is a precarious one at best. As such, it is argued in this chapter that the no-fly list plotline of the war on terror masks the techno-deterministic and discriminatory thinking behind these security measures; that the right technological arrangement, deployed in the right way, can invariably solve any political problem, including terrorism."

By taking an approach drastically different from previous TRA research, this paper focuses on how attitude toward a behavior and perceived norms would influence individuals uses of various reasons to explain their behavioral intentions to others. Also, this study examined how different cultural backgrounds (Korean and US American) would influence peoples citation of the same components related to behavioral intention. The study did not find that one culture always used attitudinal components to explain individuals behavioral intentions while the other always used normative components to explain individuals behavioral intentions. Instead, it provided evidence that the relative importance of each TRA component differed depending on the type of behavior being explained. Furthermore, the relationships that attitudinal and normative components had with behavioral intention were not the same as the relationship that attitudinal and normative determinants had with intentions to use attitude-related reasoning and norm-related reasoning. The behavioral type and the norm types were important factors for the relationships among attitudes, norms, and various types of intentions."

In this study, the adaptation of mainland Chinese postgraduate students to Hong Kong is investigated based on the dynamic model of cognitive/affect/behavior components. Both institutional factors focusing on college impact and cultural elements are taken into account.

This study provides further support for this dynamic framework and most proposed relationships in the model are confirmed. Results show that, cross-cultural awareness (cognitive) and cultural empathy (affective) both have facilitated academic integration and social interaction (behavior). The positive role of additive bilingualism and the moderator role of mass media usage in cross-cultural adaptation are supported and formative."

Nearly all of the mainstream appearances of this image either play on or debunk the fact that it is not an image of Palin, and yet refer to her democratizing appeal (i.e. hunter, beauty queen, NRA member, good American); even the sexualization of the image (beauty queen, MILF and so on) can be seen as part of Palins appeal rather than straightforward parody. There are two major considerations here: first, that this parody refers so closely to the actual Palins politics and persona (even though it is a fake) that it isnt seen uniformly as parody at all, and second, that Palins own media appearances (such as her recent cameo on SNL) enhance what could be called her spectacular value (following Debord and Baudrillard) to the point that the real and the fake (or televisual, or spectacular) Palin can no longer be differentiated."

The presentation will analyze a variety of populist and countercultural trends in recent years ranging from online sexism to spoofing to self-branding and hype manufacturing in the Chinese blogosphere. While these trends have raised eyebrows of ideological conservatives from the state bureaucracy, they continue to attract heavy traffic over the Internet and redefine the horizons of Chinas popular cultural landscape at a time of a rapid change. The discussion offers insights on the particular social, cultural and political contexts that conduce toward these controversial manifestations in the newfound platforms of blogs across different spectrums of the Chinese society."

For some, the media fan community becomes this social network. Contrary to the popular media and some research literature that depicts fan/celebrity interaction as obsessive on the part of the fan and a potential nuisance to the celebrity, studied fan subcultures were characterized by fan/celebrity interaction that was reciprocal and symbiotic, collaborative and mutually beneficial. Observations from 20 years of participant/observer ethnography in multiple fan subcultures will support these concepts and a positive interpretation of fan communities."

Journals control our intellectual property, lawyers cry foul when we quote from copyrighted material, and a bevy of conflicting incentivesboth ideological and repressiveswirl around us every day. Following Raymond Williams work on the development of television, the internet appears as a site of struggle between existing social needs and commercial intentions, threatening the proprietary infrastructure of print-based publishing while also increasing profits through lucrative online database subscriptions. Given the fluidity of the moment, how should media scholars organize our own use of the media? This presentation features a case study in the fair use of visual data as evidence, continues with an account of a campaign to convince Taylor & Francis to accept the SPARC Author Rights Addendum, and concludes with a discussion and demonstration of ScholarWorks, the open access institutional repository hosted by UMass, Amherst."

Unlike previous qualitative studies of LAN spaces (e.g., Beavis et al., 2005; Bryce and Rutter, 2005; Beavis and Charles, 2007), this critical ethnography focuses on the gameplay practices that emerge during all-night play sessions dominated by gamers protracted interactions with military-themed games. The author finds that the intensely competitive social environment engendered in this LAN setting is shaped as much by the popular war-oriented games as it is by the devoted, hard core players who frequent the center. Moreover, the power hierarchies established in the fictional, ludic worlds are reified and replayed in the real world, as the dominance displayed in virtual battlefields migrates to the offline world. Specifically, players often enforce social rules and dictum, and police and mark others when they fail to play as expected (i.e., play like a noob tube). Furthermore, the ludic war experience that the author coins and examines highlights how militarism and gaming technologies influence the emergent play behavior that come to dominate this shared gaming space."
2009-0545,Fear in the Context of Family Television Viewing,tudying Preschool Audiences: Methodological Innovations and Practical Implications,,,,Paper,Fear in the Context of Family Television Viewing,Studying Preschool Audiences: Methodological Innovations and Practical Implications,"One of the key recommendations on television viewing is: if it is done at all, it should be done together with the parents. This supports the childs learning process and provides assistance in emotionally critical moments. But what happens when children experience fear during television viewing with their family? 63 children between the ages of five and ten were asked to try and recall such a situation, draw a picture of it and explained it in face-to-face interviews. The analysis focused on what had triggered their fear, how they handled the situation, and how they dealt with their fear afterwards or whether there were still any recurrent after-effects. Furthermore, the study with children was complemented by a questionnaire-based study among 108 students in order to obtain their retrospective view of their own early childhood television experiences. The results thus yielded not only represent a vital guide for educationists and television makers, but also pose important questions regarding methodology."

Since then, the term feedback has ballooned in scientific and popular use. This paper asks what ideas preceded the postwar naming of feedback, and the introduction reviews several leads, with special emphasis given to Wieners often overlooked choice of dissertation adviser, Josiah Royce, the now largely forgotten philosopher of absolute idealism. Royce and Wieners affinity for mathematically describing self-representative systems are then compared, featuring in particular Royces 1899 work on maps-within-maps as a philosophical precursor to feedback. The paper then contrasts Royces philosophy of possibility with Wieners empiricism by probability and concludes by suggesting how the study of computing and communications can benefit from further enriched understanding of our modern vocabulary for reflexivity in general and feedback in particular."

Women raised their vocal pitch during high-fertility, and this change increased as a function of proximity to estimated day of ovulation. But this change only happened in socially communicative utterances, not spoken vowel sounds. Follow up work examined how normally cycling women changed their voices when asked to produce introductory sentences in different contexts including a condition where they were told they will be judged for attractiveness by men. When trying to be attractive, women often raise their pitch, supporting the notion that vocal attractiveness manipulations are tied to cues of femininity. How these vocal changes vary across the cycle will be reported, and the acoustic data will be described along with results of perception experiments using the voices."

Current discussions about the neo-liberal feminine subject, and the role reality television makeover shows play in appealing to the endless transformability of this subject, and in inculcating a critical gaze in young women, form the theoretical background for this investigation. The paper analyzes the results of focus group discussions with young teens and college women fans of the show. The girls consciousness about feminism is probed, as is their consciousness about the kind of appeal the show makes to the endless work of bodily transformation that they are invited to perform on their own bodies. The paper compares the level of consciousness about these issues amongst girls of the different age groups, and begins to make an argument about the way cultural critiques of feminism have blunted the ability of young women to receive reality television, in particular the makeover show, critically."
2009-0549,Feminist and Feminine: Becoming the Bride,Beyond the Modifier: Feminist as Keyword,,,,Paper,Feminist and Feminine: Becoming the Bride,Beyond the Modifier: Feminist as Keyword,"Feminist scholarship has offered profound insights into how culture-bound rituals such as proms and weddings operate as events that forge, reproduce and concretize meanings and expectations about gendered roles for men and women. Moreover, feminist scholars such as Amy Best have pointed out question how ideologies about romance underpin these rituals are woven into the fabric of girls daily lives, positioning them subordinate ways in relation to boys. And yet, current debates surrounding the neo-liberal feminine subject and third-wave feminism have called into question the model of power implemented in most contemporary analysis.

In an effort engage current feminist conversations about power and the self, this paper analyzes a range of diverse cultural mechanisms that enable brides to simultaneously perform as feminist and feminine. Questions considered include the following: How is transformation from a normal gendered self into a bride configured through and across discourse, and what, specifically, do these subjective modifications involve? What is the nature of the privileged space brides occupy, and how does this privilege get articulated to gendered modes of expression? Finally, the paper offers a materialist argument that feminists can refine our conceptualizations of power by considering what these preparations reveal and conceal about the lives of adult women in the contemporary United States.

Materials analyzed include ethnographic data collected from a bridal bootcamp sponsored by an elite university, a selection of reality shows featuring wedding preparation, recent Hollywood films that represent wedding preparation, as well as trade journals that target the wedding planning industry."

We argue that, not only is feminist work foundational and crucial to our field, but that in order to be so it need not have women or gender as its primary object of analysis. In this paper we interrogate how feminist thinking has informed the framing of, and methodological approach taken in, current joint research on socialising and self-representation on facebook (e.g. Skeggs (ed) 1995; Sreberny & Van Zoonen (eds) 2000; Van Zoonen 1994). We will also make reference to methodological dilemmas faced, and decisions taken, in past research we have each undertaken on audience participation (Enli, 2007) and collaborative media production (Thumim, 2007) in order to illustrate our argument"

We take an interdisciplinary theory-building approach in this study by drawing from our own areas of experience (as a scholar of 19th century history and a scholar of transnational and intercultural communication) in order to fully interrogate how the institutional, political, economic and social forces of the past enlighten our understanding of contemporary (re)productions of gender.

The study critiques the inherently reductionist and essentializing theoretical and methodological strategies and practices employed in foundational intercultural communication research and questions why there have been so few insightful studies on gender outside the body of scholarship of critical intercultural communication studies. Recently, feminist scholars have begun to employ a more complex understanding of gender and power in their work on intercultural communication. In particular, they have taken account of historical and structural forces shape the relations of gender, culture and power, and influence intercultural communication contexts, encounters, and relationships. Finally, the paper examines the critical perspectives of gender emerging in disciplines such as feminist history and critical/cultural studies conceptualizing gender as complex, multifarious, and changing; gender is an unfixed, fluid variable that (re)positions given varied circumstances, situations, and frameworks."
2009-0552,"Feminist Media Studies, Meet ""The Trades""",Beyond the Modifier: Feminist as Keyword,,,,Paper,"Feminist Media Studies, Meet ""The Trades""",Beyond the Modifier: Feminist as Keyword,"This paper makes an argument for a feminist media research methodology that includes media trade literature. Publications such as Broadcasting & Cable (B&C), Advertising Age, and Madison + Vine, for example, are important and influential outreach vehicles within the various media industries. Because they also play an important role in media policy-making (for example, B&C is the publication for the National Association of Broadcasters [NAB]) and in media-industry reality making, they deserve serious scrutiny by feminist media scholars. Together, the trades constitute a discourse that comprises the ideologies of media professionals and executives, the policy-making desires of media industries and their lobbyists, and the financial considerations that undergird the production of media output, especially its representational politics.

Trade discourse is also gendered, and when yoked to feminist media theory it yields valuable insights for feminist scholars interested in the economic concerns that infuse decisions about media content, distribution, and desirable target audiences (which are often majority female). Both the advertising that adorns the pages of the trades and their content explain how gendered representations and appeals to consume media output are structured and promoted.

Scrutinizing the trades in this way can help to answer a question that guides much feminist media scholarship: what is the relationship between gender and power in media? More specifically, a trade-based feminist analysis would ask how trade literatureacting as a mouthpiece for the media industriesrepresents, comments on, and then profits from that relationship. This crucially important, yet often overlooked site, aids in the process of understanding media industries gender politics as they construct gender and represent it to themselves in a process of consolidating power and maximizing profit."

Although Marvel Studios only began producing films in the last ten years, their success is historic. Due to the Spiderman franchise, Marvel Studios is responsible for three of the top twenty biggest grossing films of all time. Marvel Studios has also had success with the X-Men films, the Fantastic Four films, and more recently, Ironman. I will analyze several games that were released as spin-offs of the these films, and argue that they demonstrate strategic intertextuality. Specifically, I will argue that the video games work to link the films to the comic books on which they are based. In this way, these games function to reproduce the fan culture that Marvel Comics has maintained over the years."

A review of the meaning of authenticity in many different contexts is joined with a critical review of trends in the promotional culture industry to demonstrate that authenticity is the most recent trick or gimmick used to promote and advertise. The dilemma faced by Disney/ABC when Gibson was arrested for drunk driving just months before the release of Apocalypto was solved through the use of a neutral news format to rehabilitate Gibsons image and project the film as an authentic representation of an ancient culture. The paper demonstrates the limits of using authenticity as a promotional tool and suggests the difficulty of projecting authenticity in any media contrived environment."

In Study 1 it was found that identification with characters was associated with the degree of enjoyment of the spectators of feature-length films of different genres. Study 2 showed that identification with characters predicts the affective impact of a dramatic film. It was also found that identification with characters was associated with greater cognitive elaboration and a better quality or more complex reflexive process during the viewing of a dramatic feature-length film. Finally, in Study 3 it was observed that identification with characters was an explanatory variable of narrative persuasion. These results support the centrality of the construct of identification with characters in analyzing the effects of media entertainment, and narrative persuasion in particular."

Today stars and celebrities often appear in popular culture as civic intermediaries, working to forge and manage relationships between their fans/media audiences and a wide range of global social causes. Stars like Bono and Jolie use their media celebrity to direct public attention to social issues such as disease, poverty, and the plight of refugees in war-torn countries. Much more than high-profile contributors to charitable or political causes, these celebrities often come down to Earth, stepping outside the representational worlds fabricated by Hollywood and its ancillary industries to work directly with community stakeholders, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropic agencies, and powerful governing institutions in order to advance solutions to the thorny problems facing societies. Through their work with the United Nations and NGOs, stars are emerging as material agents within and influential members of global civil society. In order to begin to understand and critically evaluate these recent developmentswhich might be called a celebrification of global politicsI situate Jolie in relation to the regimes and rationalities of global neoliberal governmentalities."

First, fake news providers such as Jon Stewart or Chris Morris draw attention to the workings of media power  in particular, they open up an analysis of media in terms of symbolic power. Second, fake news, as satire, matters to media scholars because there are clear parallels between satire on the one hand and academic media criticism on the other, and a consideration of these parallels can help set each in a fresh context. The paper first defines symbolic power, before identifying the key actors and groups who are able to exercise it in relation to news and current affairs. It then argues that satirists occupy a crucial position in relation to the news, able to simultaneously critique symbolic power while exercising it themselves. The paper takes the work of UK media satirist Chris Morris as its case study, concentrating on his fake news TV series The Day Today (BBC, 1994) and Brass Eye (Channel 4, 1997, 2001)."

Roosevelt became president in 1933, he used radio to reach millions of people with his fireside chats. This study analyzes coverage of Roosevelts radio addresses by The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, and Time Magazine. The results indicate that the three print media provided coverage of the presidents radio addresses, but that coverage waned by the end of his presidency. The results also indicate that the Chicago Tribune and Time were much more critical of the president, but all three print media showed restraint during World War II. All three media also accurately reported his radio addresses."

We propose a conceptual model integrating individual decision criteria, privacy rules (as manifest in strategies for verifying disclosures made by communication partners), and self-disclosure which is tested on a nationwide sample of online dating participants (N=562). Our findings confirm that verification strategies are predicted by three sets of online dating concerns - personal security, misrepresentation, and recognition  as well as self-efficacy and Internet experience. In turn, those who engage in more frequent verification strategies report greater amounts of self-disclosure with potential online dating partners. Implications for CPM theory and the warranting principle in online contexts (Walther & Parks, 2002) are discussed."

Male flirters were perceived as more dominant when flirting for sexual reasons, more affiliative when flirting for relational reasons, and overall more dominant and affiliative than females. Males dominance was not significantly related to physical attraction, social attraction, or conversational effectiveness.

Benefiting from the unprecedented opportunity of obtaining game log data matched with survey data, it investigated the associations between game expertise and offline player characteristics as well as game motivations and behaviors. Players who were high on achievement motivation or social motivation had higher game expertise, while those high on immersion motivation had lower expertise. Game experts were also characterized by spending more time in the game and focusing their game time on completing tasks. Younger players showed a slim advantage over older players. Male and female players exhibited similar expertise levels in MMORPGs."

Bush,The Complexities of Watchdogging,"Following the U.S. terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, media critics and scholars noted that the American press appeared to show greater deference to President George W. Bushs policies, and failed to aggressively question the presidents arguments for going to war in Iraq. Given the importance of a watchdog press in a democracy, this study seeks to identify one potential psychological explanation for why journalists may exhibit greater support for the president during times of crises: the thought of death. Previous research in terror management theory indicates that thoughts of death, including reminders of 9/11, cause people to look more favorably toward leaders, including the president, as a psychological self-esteem-boosting defense mechanism. This study seeks to test whether the same applies to journalists. An experiment found that U.S. journalists primed to think of their own deaths reported stronger support and trust in President Bush than journalists in a control group. The effects were strongest among those who rated themselves politically moderate or conservative. Implications for news coverage, gatekeeping theory, and preventing attitudinal shifts in the future are discussed."

In this theoretical paper I point to the importance of a turn to the aesthetic in media studies, arguing that it illuminates and brings into analytical alignment four apparently dis-articulated dimensions of creative practice. First, it points to an industry logic in which, as theorists of cultural economy suggest, the aesthetic becomes a driver of cultural and economic innovation. Second, it fills a yawning gap in theories of creative agency by pointing to the core existential dilemma faced by producers: how to orient their practice in relation to the given aesthetic trajectories of the genres in which they work, a dilemma that is profoundly historical. Third, an analytics of the aesthetic opens new perspectives on questions of invention and value in the media text / object. And fourth, these in turn proffer a new nonreductive, noninstrumental, post-Benjaminian and post-Adornian optic
on the cultural politics of media experience."

The analysis will focus on two questions: First, are there any distinctive patterns of news coverage in different countries or world regions that can be traced to the political or cultural ties of the United States with these countries or regions? In other words, do countries with strong ties to the United States cover the primaries more prominently than countries with weaker ties? The second question addressed here will focus on how prominent the coverage of the primaries might be in comparison with other foreign news topics within each nation. Prominence of news will be analyzed in terms of the number and the duration of news stories about the primaries and their placement within the newscasts of all countries included in this study."

This paper discusses three conceptual tensions regarding contemporary developments, challenges, and problems of television news in general and foreign news production in particular. First, we partially question the implied assumption of gatekeeping theory that considers the nation state as the dominant referent for selecting news by suggesting new patterns for mapping the world. Second, while framing theory has lent support to claims that different frames are deployed for domestic and foreign news events, we argue that foreign news tends to be more conflict-ridden and sensational than domestic news. Finally, in the process of journalism as sense-making in society, foreign news needs to be rendered familiar to home audiences, thus the domestication of news may be understood as popular enlightenment, but it may also result in ethnocentrism, reifications of nationalism, or secularization of public affairs."
2009-0568,Formative Belief-Elicitation Research: Lessons From the Temporal Construal Theory,Health Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Formative Belief-Elicitation Research: Lessons From the Temporal Construal Theory,Health Communication Poster Session,"Research on temporal construal demonstrates that time frame significantly affects the type of beliefs people generate and rely on when making decisions. Specifically, TCT research suggests that future choices are construed in abstract terms and are guided by desirability considerations, whereas proximal ones are construed in concrete terms and are guided by feasibility considerations. Thus, different types of considerations determine preferences at different points in time. Empirical evidence suggests that people are generally not aware of such time frame effects, and, therefore, are not very good at accurately predicting their future preferences and intents. If the behavior is framed as proximal, people will mentally represent it in terms of low-level construals, will generate and/or retrieve more control beliefs associated with performance of that behavior, and will likely base their behavioral intent on those doability beliefs. If, on the other hand, the behavior is framed as distal, people will likely represent it in terms of high-level construals, will generate and/or retrieve more attitudinal beliefs associated with performance and outcomes of that behavior, and will base their decision on those attitudinal beliefs.
The present study tests assumptions of TCT in the framework of intent-driven behaviors. Our results indicate that temporal frame significantly affects the type of generated beliefs and their number, but not their valence. Contrary to previous research, our findings suggest that effect of the time frame may be behavior-specific. Implications for the formative research are discussed."

It is recognized as an obstacle to the achievement of the objectives of democracy: equality, development and peace. This social problem represents the main obstacle for the human rights of Mexican women and girls throughout their life cycle.
Many social, cultural and legal factors make the Violence against women in Mexico one of the most pressing problems in the country, including the configuration of stereotypes of gender in media discourses. This paper, from a Feminist perspective, shows the results of the two years Violence of gender against women and girls in the Mexican media agenda project. Using content analysis, the paper answers the question: What is the social representation of violence of gender against women and girls in the agenda of the main Mexican television channels, radio stations, newspapers, magazines and web-pages? The dimensions of the social representation of violence against women in media discourses allow the analysis of how victims and aggressors are represented, the forms of violence of gender, the treatment of this problem as a private problem and the responsibility of Mexican institutions, among others.
The findings show that Mexican media transmit contents where stereotyped images of discrimination and violence against women are common, and that through such discourses the media contribute to perpetuate them. The paper points out the need for the adoption of policies to eliminate these images, by informing, explaining and stimulating the public debate and actions for the eradication of violence against women, with a perspective that promotes a society based on equality and respect, essential for the development and peace in contemporary societies."

Similar claims have been made with previous technologies. The adoption of interactive web technologies has often been accompanied by a philosophic reversion to unproblematic interpretations of democracy, free speech, and dialogue  where more speech is valued over quality speech and the technology itself is cherished over all. These beliefs are at the heart of the present discourse involving Web 2.0, involving sites from YouTube.com to IndyMedia.org and including practices such as video blogs and citizen journalism. This precis explores the assumptions of dialogue and interactivity within Web 2.0 from the framework of Dervins Sense-Making Methodology."

This study focuses on ArtLink, which is an organization based on a new model for young friends groups that attempts to create identification between nonprofit organizations and members of Generation Y via an umbrella organization that serves as the formal young friends group for five distinct affiliate organizations that are all focused on supporting the arts. This case study explains the language used on the ArtLink website to create identification between ArtLink members and the five affiliate organizations in a variety of possible rolesdonors, volunteers, or event attendees. The website language is categorized into three categories: providing choices, offering social inclusion, and promoting a shared interest in the arts, that together provide a preliminary explanation of how this model for organizational identification is communicated via the internet and what the potential problems are inherent in this model."

The study involved an intensive ten-week pedagogical intervention in which students were involved in a conscientizing process in order to facilitating their journeys to more critical self-reflection in analyzing their engagements with culture. Through extensive self-interviews, the students were asked to dig for their own responses to cultural experiences and to connect these to the material conditions of their own lives."
2009-0573,Fragile Values: Media Scandals and Their Ambivalent Role in Cultural Change,Fragility: Towards a New Vocabulary of Culture and Communication,,,,Paper,Fragile Values: Media Scandals and Their Ambivalent Role in Cultural Change,Fragility: Towards a New Vocabulary of Culture and Communication,"In everyday communication, scandals are usually considered signs of declining moral values. However, it seems more productive to describe scandals both as indicators and catalysts of cultural change with an unforeseeable outcome, which can shake and stabilize social norms and thus can have a potentially socialising as well as a potentially destructive effect.
My paper is going to present a theoretical concept and a qualitative discourse-analysis of contemporary media scandals in order to illustrate how the study of scandals can be one way to introduce the concept of fragility as a new keyword in cultural and communication theory. Media scandals, which are themselves fragile processes, can serve as models of how contemporary media culture constantly bridges the gap between the individual need for momentarily stable orientation within socio-historical contingency and the continuous state of flux of todays liquid modernity."
2009-0574,"Fragmented Globalization, Contested Realities: American and Indian Newspaper Coverage of the Outsourcing Issue",Framing the news,,,,Paper,"Fragmented Globalization, Contested Realities: American and Indian Newspaper Coverage of the Outsourcing Issue",Framing the news,"The growing outsourcing of technology services jobs to India, that achieved a media crescendo in the years leading up to the 2004 U.S. Presidential elections, pointed to more than the waning days of job creation in yet another industry in America. It intensified the U.S. media recognition of the arrival of India as a rising economic power in the global scene. Free market advocates in the American media, despite angry reactions from American technology workers who lost their jobs, believed that economic globalization was good for America and India as it would eventually lead to the opening up of Indian economy to international trade in the long term. However, in the hostile labor atmosphere of the United States free market advocacy was not easy, just as the acceptance of it was severely contested in India. This paper, through a narrative analysis, brings out the struggle of American and Indian newspapers in reconciling the clash between competing economic and political ideologies to illustrate the media representation of the fragmented nature of globalization and its contested acceptance."

Based on a standardized content analysis of media framing studies in 15 international journals from 1990 to 2005, this presentation aims to reveal sites of fracture in framing research.
Frames found in media content studies are compared with frame understandings in other fields. It is found that framing scholars do not always share a common conceptualization of this key term. It appears that mass communication researchers analyze frames that other scholars might regard as rather irrelevant. Thus, although framing theory can profit from a conceptual and paradigmatic diversity, scholars need to develop a shared definition of this keyword in communication. The presentation ends with guidelines to achieve this aim."

We make an analytical distinction between framing messages (which highlight certain considerations but do not include evidence relevant to the content of that consideration) and messages with evidence, allowing us to compare these messages and isolate the effects of messages that emphasize certain considerations rather than provide relevant evidence. We find that frames are no stronger than evidence messages. In addition, we find that while evidence messages interact with political knowledge, frames do not, suggesting that individuals need some previous exposure to politics for evidence based messages to work."
2009-0577,Framing and Trans-Framing: A Mental Models Approach to News Framing Effects,Cognitive Approaches to Framing,,,,Paper,Framing and Trans-Framing: A Mental Models Approach to News Framing Effects,Cognitive Approaches to Framing,"In this study we investigate the cognitive mechanism by which news frames exert their influences on individuals by providing a mental models approach. We propose a theoretical model of news framing effects with particular focus on the role of baseline interpretation that individuals construct. The model suggests that the primary effect of news frame involves a process in which news frame affects individuals situation model (i.e., a mental representation of a specific situation described in a news article) by altering their baseline interpretation about the situation. Then, through the mediating role of this process, the model further posits that news frame would exert subsequent effects on individuals attitudes toward the issue that the article concerns (attitudinal effect) and on the construction of situation models about other related issues (trans-framing effect). Experimental results largely support the model. First, individuals exposed to a news frame were more likely to construct a frame-consistent situation model by forming a frame-consistent baseline interpretation. Second, news frame exerted indirect effects on individuals attitudes by altering their situation model. Finally, the results showed some evidence for the trans-framing effects."

In contrast to most framing effects research that tests the effects of frame stimulus in isolation, this study tests two different frames of GCC with and without a competing counter-frame in a 2x2 experimental (plus control) design. A two-wave nationally representative online survey panel (N=1100) is employed with subjects attitudes and perceptions of GCC collected in wave 1 and randomly assigned to conditions and exposed to differing 45 second video GCC PSAs in Wave 2. Wave 2 also includes a brief questionnaire evaluating both cognitive and emotional responses to the PSAs. This methodology allows both between and within subject analysis as well as contrasts to a control condition. How message competition moderates both cognitive and emotional responses to message frames, as well as interactions between individual characteristics such as opinion intensity, prior knowledge, and need for cognition are discussed."

This concentration on individual-level effects of framing in political research appears to assume 1) that we can aggregate individuals' opinions, however informed or manipulated by framing, into a true ""public opinion"" and
2) that elites want to, can, and must accurately figure out and respond to this ""public opinion."" This paper suggests that these are debatable assumptions. It argues that what matters politically is less what ""people"" in general ""possibly"" can do under ideal conditions than to explore what those with malleable opinions--swing voters, moderates, those most open to new framing messages-- will do. We need a truly political theory of framing that goes beyond effects on individuals and recognizes multiple layers of communication and power relationships. This means researching creation and circulation of frames at every level of the system, elite, media, and individual; it means taking a diachronic rather than the dominant synchronic perspective on framing; and it means studying political framing in all communication texts not just those labeled as ""news."""

The Death with Dignity National Center is an Oregon-based advocacy group in favor of legalized physician-assisted suicide and takes responsibility for the successful passage of the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. Like many interest groups, the Death with Dignity National Center attempts to manipulate or inspire news coverage of its cause via several methods. This includes appealing directly to news organizations through press releases. Analysis reveals several significant correlations between how the press releases and newspaper coverage framed physician-assisted suicide. Both the releases and the coverage framed the issue to be about conflict, political consequences, big government, patient rights, or legality, and utilized these frames in similar ways. This study represents a new line of framing theory research in that it explores content through the traditional method of analyzing for frame frequency but also suggests integrating frame attributes  namely, frame valence and levels of substance  into this analysis."

Furthermore, the effects of negative, positive, or absent descriptive norms within the frame message are considered. Participants engaged in a 3 x 2 factorial design experiment in which they read four articles, one of which was the manipulation followed by a questionnaire assessing their own attitudes, normative beliefs, behavioral intentions, and perceptions of collective norms. The experiment also included two different behavioral measures, one immediate and the other with a one-week delay. The results indicate that perceptions of collective norms moderate behavioral outcomes more so for collective frames of GCC as compared to individual frames. In addition, positive normative cues embedded in frames enhance the perceived likelihood of collective action. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed."

Framing the concept of the Digital Divide, this paper maps the status and causes of the phenomenon today. It investigates how digital inequalities can be measured, and whether the Digital Divide can be understood as being only a problem of access to the Internet. It argues for a need to equally focus on the making of the Internet. In order to do this, the first part of the paper examines the concept of the Network Society. The second part maps the distribution of the worldwide Internet usage with national indicators and shows how economic factors cause some of these inequalities. Moreover, the paper traces the worldwide unequal distribution of some of the infrastructure of the Internet and provides a mapping of the origin of Internet contents as well as of Internet makers."

However, the hybrid framing concept has proved difficult to translate into a comparative and longitudinal research design for the analysis of empirical data. This article focuses on the law and order frame and the injustice and defiance frame as introduced by Wolfsfeld (1997). The paper aims to achieve a clear operationalisation of those frames. For this purpose, we have refined Wolfsfelds frame signature matrix on the basis of variables described by Van Gorp (2004). We identified framing and reasoning devices that could be ascertained and applied to the study of the coverage of the First and Second Intifada in the Flemish written press.
In the second place, we focused on the execution of the proposed frame analysis. We concluded that during the First Intifada the injustice and defiance frame was predominant in the coverage. During the Second Intifada the law and order frame dominated. In other words, we established that the aspect of the coverage of the Intifadas had to a certain extent changed."

Analysis was conducted through neural network analysis with the CatPac computer program. Supporters of the policy use a development frame which defines population as a problem borne out of people having large families; it is argued that unchecked population growth negatively impacts on development outcomes such as education and income. In the development frame the proposed solution is to institute a population management policy that promotes family planning (contraceptive use) to help Filipinos achieve their desired family size. Opponents on the other hand use two frames, one which equates the policies with abortion, and another which argues that such policies will lead to a degradation of moral values. Results delineate the competing frames from both sides and show that the media frame reflects both views, but that the discourse is presented as conflict."
2009-0585,Free but responsible? Assessing the media's democratic role in South Africa and Namibia,Political Communication in Transitional Democracies - A Global Perspective,,,,Paper,Free but responsible? Assessing the media's democratic role in South Africa and Namibia,Political Communication in Transitional Democracies - A Global Perspective,"The South African and Namibian media have undergone major changes as a result of significant political shifts during the 1990s. The demise of apartheid in South Africa was a major impetus, which brought about changes in the political systems of both these countries. Concomitantly, the media in these newly democratic societies also reconfigured their role within a new environment. This included the adoption of ethical codes in an attempt to assure responsible journalism in a democratic society. This new system has however not meant that politicians and journalists necessarily share the same view on the medias role, nor has it managed to avoid conflicts between them. Interpretations of the core value framework for the media and assessments of the medias ability to adhere to these values seem to differ across the media and political spectrum. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with journalists and politicians in South Africa and Namibia during summer 2008, this paper explores how values like freedom of speech, media responsibility and the democratic role of the media are understood by these various roleplayers. The aim is to gain a better understanding of how these interpretations inform the sometimes strained relationship between media and politicians in these emerging democracies."
2009-0586,Freedom of Expression and the Right to Know: New Conceptualizations in International Human Rights Law,Policy and Global Communication: International Law and Communication Rights,,,,Paper,Freedom of Expression and the Right to Know: New Conceptualizations in International Human Rights Law,Policy and Global Communication: International Law and Communication Rights,"Conceptualizing access to government information as a human right is one of the latest developments in the global trend promoting access to information. Many international human rights bodies, nongovernmental organizations, and legal scholars have argued that access to information is a human right. Often this claim is based on the view that the right of freedom of expression also confers a right to government-held information. This paper explicates the freedom-of-expression conceptualization by examining international human right law, normative arguments of international inter-governmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations. Three central rationales were discovered for linking a right to government-held information to the right of freedom of expression: the seek-and-receive, self-governance, and good-governance rationales. Government information also is understood as a public good belonging to the people; therefore, citizens do not have to show a direct interest in the information in order to request access to it. Because information is owned by the people, the freedom-of-expression conceptualization requires that there is a presumption of disclosure. This right of information is not absolute. Governments can limit the disclosure of information, but this conceptualization requires governments to explicitly establish limitations in the law and provide a written justification for nondisclosure. Limitations on information must be based a significant public interest, must be narrow-drawn and interpreted, and balanced in favor of the publics interest in receiving the information. Governments bear the burden of proof in proving that limitations on information serve a legitimate interest that outweighs the publics right to know."

Begun by workers agitating for better wages, it was co-opted by trade unionists, and became part of a larger focus on self government. As the movement changed, the rhetoric became more and more radical. The ideology of the movement found its way into written form inside the four-page leaflet published by these two laborers, Hugh Buchanan and Stennet Kerr-Coombs. These men became obvious targets for arresting the movement and were prosecuted by the authorities for seditious libel. The article traces their prosecution and six-month sentence and places it in the context of the 1938 risings."

Heretofore, fans, producers, and cultural critics have focused on the series authenticity, to the detriment of a serious engagement with the political economic context into which the shows intervened, effectively dehistoricizing its claims. This paper asks what the authenticity of Degrassi enables through an examination of Degrassi Talks, six episodes that are more or less a combination between a public service announcement and an after-school special produced by the creators of Degrassi on a commission from the Canadian Department of Health and Well-Being. 1992, the year of the Degrassi Talks specials, is part of a moment of crisis in Canadian government, a period marking the beginning of Canadas official neoliberalization. In its role as an official state communique, Degrassi Talks deploys tropes of authenticity in the service of neoliberal decision-making strategies; this paper outlines the contours of what neoliberal citizenship means and how it is constructed in this context. These specials, though they lay a claim to increased authenticity by letting teens speak for themselves, reproduce many neoliberal notions about self-esteem and discipline, although they do acknowledge an excess that neoliberalism can disdain, but not contain."
2009-0589,Freezing the Flow of Online News: Exploring Approaches to Study the Liquidity of Online News,Methodological Issues in Studying Journalism,,,,Paper,Freezing the Flow of Online News: Exploring Approaches to Study the Liquidity of Online News,Methodological Issues in Studying Journalism,"According to previous research, online news as opposed to traditional news is characterized by interactivity, immediacy and liquidity. However, most research in this area has focused on the news site-level of analysis, and there are still only few studies on how interactivity, immediacy and liquidity affect online news on the news story-level. In addition, there are virtually no content analyses that include online news while taking its special characteristics into consideration. Thus, the overall purpose of this paper is to explore approaches for the study of interactivity, immediacy and liquidity on the news story-level of analysis. The paper develops a three-pronged strategy for freezing the flow of online news to enable systematic content analyses of how online news stories are affected by interactivity, immediacy and liquidity. The paper also tests this strategy in a comparative analysis of the news sites Guardian.co.uk in Britain and Aftonbladet.se in Sweden."

In contrast, this paper conceptualizes globalization as a complex fluctuating process or dispositif, during which local, national, and global forces interact. The French version of American idol, ""Nouvelle Star,"" is used as an example of ""glocalized hybridization"" as outlined by Appadurai (1990), Pieterse (1994), and Wellman (2001). In its initial stages, the French program bared a strong resemblance with its British and American counterparts, as it was designed like a popularity contest and capitalized on audiences' affective relationship with the contestants. While it retained some of these characteristics, it mutated into a so-called ""high culture"" program emphasizing aesthetics and musical taste. The analysis shows how two competing cultural models  an Anglo-Saxon conception of 'pop-culture' and the French alleged taste for the 'high arts'  were confronting themselves through dynamics of power and resistance to be eventually integrated into a wider scheme of production."
2009-0591,From Bodies to Physical Traits and Affective States,Body Talk (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,From Bodies to Physical Traits and Affective States,Body Talk (Cross Unit),"This talk revisits the body to examine how it is being de-centered by other terms, some of them older, like sexual difference, and some more unusual, like physiognomy and the concept of the composite. These terms represent shifting schemas for examining living and laboring in physical carriages marked by observable traits and affective states. In these schemas, sexual difference and the pseudo-science of physiognomy and composite photography can address some of the essentializing identity problems that continue to dog the body in both feminist and cultural studies.

I draw on these frames to think through the physicality of bodies and what Liz Grosz calls the forgotten question of ontology in feminist thought."
2009-0592,From Breaking News to Making News. Challenges for Swedish Professional Journalism in New Media Environments,Deciding What is Newsworthy,,,,Paper,From Breaking News to Making News. Challenges for Swedish Professional Journalism in New Media Environments,Deciding What is Newsworthy,"The objective of this paper is to analyze and discuss the contemporary transition of news journalism practices in traditional mass media in Sweden within an increasingly digital and more competitive media environment. Furthermore, the paper discusses the transformation of both the concepts of newsworthiness and news selection in leading Swedish national media organizations. Methodologically, the analysis of news production conditions in this paper is based on two different studies: a quantitative content analysis of more than 7,000 front page articles and broadcast news features and three participatory studies of newsroom practices, followed by twelve in-depth interviews with news editors in the media organizations and in which news room work was studied.
The results of this study indicate that newsroom practices and news making processes are strongly influenced by the changes within the new media environment. Some traditional criteria for news values and news selection prevail, but the demand for exclusive news stories and news stories with a great visualization potential has increased in all kinds of media. In general, news journalism practices in traditional media appear to decide what is news with greater regard to current media working conditions than with the distinctive characters of the event that have been so central in previous research with regards to newsroom decisions."
2009-0593,From Digital Divide to Linguistic Divide: Chinese in the Cyber World,"New Media, National Image, and Social Transition in the Chinese Context",,,,Paper,From Digital Divide to Linguistic Divide: Chinese in the Cyber World,"New Media, National Image, and Social Transition in the Chinese Context","Due to historical and technical reasons, the cyberspace is dominated by the English language and English language users, suggesting a form of cultural imperialism, or computer-assisted colonization. There is evidently a digital divide among countries, compounded by the linguistic divide in the cyberspace.
The recent trend however shows a rapid growth of Internet users in Asian countries, narrowing the digital divide between the West and Asia. Since these Asian countries are predominantly non-English speaking, we have also observed a concomitant increase in the contents in non-English languages in cyberspace, which signifies the narrowing of the linguistic divide.
Among the Asian countries, China has demonstrated the most impressive growth in the number of Internet use and in its penetration rate. As of today, China has surpassed the USA to become the country with the largest Internet population. Since China is still small in penetration rate, there is much more room for further growth in both the number of users and Chinese language contents.
The paper presents the trends of the numbers and penetration rates of Internet users in China in comparison with other major countries, both East and West. Furthermore, it purports to analyze the growth of Chinese (and non-English languages) in web contents, in comparison with that of the English language. From a perspective of the sociology of multilingualism, this paper compares the usage, functions, and roles between Chinese (as a national language) and English (as an international language).
Finally, the unique status of Chinese as the common language in the growing Chinese diasporas, and the role of the Internet in the promotion of long-distant nationalism (B. Anderson) will also be discussed."
2009-0594,From Emplaced Identities to Democratic Participants: Discourses Performed and Resisted by Retirement Village Members,tudies in Organizational Resistance,,,,Paper,From Emplaced Identities to Democratic Participants: Discourses Performed and Resisted by Retirement Village Members,Studies in Organizational Resistance,"With the increasing presence of retirement villages in New Zealand, the potential for new organizational relationships between residents, employees, and management of retirement village organizations (RVOS) emerges. Retirement villages typically represent division between work and retirement, and identify elders as dependent elderly by their emplacement (Laws, 1995, 1996) in such spaces. Discourses of aging and retirement for example, combine with the physicality of retirement villages, to separate residents from the world and activities, of work. Such, emplaced identities influence expectations of retirement village residents in their roles and activities within these spaces. Taking an organizational communication perspective and using critical discourse analysis (Fairclough 1992; van Tijk, 2000a; 2001b) we examined data from 42 employee interviews and eight focus groups with 54 residents. We examined how residents and employees drew on, resisted, and performed various discourses including, discourses of aging-as-dependence, retirement, management and market, to enact residents participation in RVOs. We identified three ideal role types in residents participation: residents as incapacitated, restricted, and managed participants. We also discuss an alternative discursive frame: residents as members within the retirement village as organization. These ideal types enable us to consider elders' and retirement village residents' roles, beyond emplaced identities and instead as democratic participants in RVOs, as well as society more widely."

2009-0596,From the Diffusion of Innovations to a General Model for Opinion Formation,Diffusion of Innovations: Retrospective and the Future,,,,Paper,From the Diffusion of Innovations to a General Model for Opinion Formation,Diffusion of Innovations: Retrospective and the Future,This paper develops the general theory of ideodynamics for predicting time trends of public opinions and behaviors in response to persuasive information. The approach is to divide research into self-contained knowledge modules that link to each other through simple but robust interfaces. Synergistic work can then occur in parallel in separate modules. Ideodynamics consists of two knowledge modules. One is a force module that places at an interface a persuasive force corresponding to information available to the public. The persuasive force can incorporate both {\em a priori} assumptions and empirically measured persuasive information. The other ideodynamic module uses persuasive forces to predict time trends of public behaviors and opinions. The theory has roots in the Bass model for the diffusion of innovations. That model is the special case of survival analysis in which the persuasive force is derived from mass media messages and infectious interpersonal communications. Data and arguments show that it is unnecessary to add two assumptions from the Rogers diffusion model. One of these Rogers postulates is a heterogeneous population distributed normally in responsiveness to information. The other Rogers condition is the need for prior awareness and trial of a new idea. Diffusion models generally omit empirical persuasive information in predicting adoption time trends. That underuse is corrected in the ideodynamic model. The use of empirical persuasive information further permits predictions between survey time points and after the last survey value.

Discussions regarding what makes a person Korean, and more importantly, who can and should be considered Korean have taken place specifically with the purpose of locating these bi/multiracial people within the Korean national identity. New policies have been introduced giving bi and multiracial Koreans access to rights previously withheld from them. Many have attributed the national attention on mixed-race Koreans to the Hines Ward mania that swept through the country in 2006. In a country that proclaims to be almost entirely ethnically homogeneous, and where that homogeneity forms the basis of Korean national identity, the assignment of rights and the acknowledgment and inclusion of mixed-race Koreans is particularly significant. It is meaningful because it has begun ushering in a new moment where the state is being forced to adapt to a new Korean identity, which is redefining family configurations as well as the relationship between the nation and race and between citizenship and the state."
2009-0598,"From ""virtuality"" to ""interactivity""",Beyond Metaphors,,,,Paper,"From ""virtuality"" to ""interactivity""",Beyond Metaphors,"The shifting metaphorical landscape of the internet frames and reflects not only our practices in using the technology but also our understanding the social context of our practices, and the utopian/dystopian discourses surrounding the future of the net. The shift from 'virtuality' to 'interactivity' over the last decade and a half takes us from metaphors in which the technology was seen as assisting our access to (forms of ) reality to metaphors in which the technology itself dis¬appears, and its role in mediating human activity is elided. The sense of Web 2.0 as more human, more authentic draws on the elision of the mediated interface. So for instance, when politicians display themselves on YouTube, the interactivity and edginess of the space is supposed to elimi¬nate the spin characteristic of the orchestrated media appearances."

The models set forth suggest the following sequence: News attention as influenced by several antecedent variables affects agenda-setting effects on the readers/viewers; in turn, agenda-setting effects trigger strong attitudes among the public and, finally, strong attitudes lead to various types of civic behaviors. The individual level of statistical analysis employed in this research is based on the 2004 ANES data along with a content analysis of stories from the New York Times and NBCs Nightly News. Fit statistics of newspaper and TV model indicated that both structural models were retainable, meaning that the hypothesized sequence reflects well the data. Especially, every direct effect along the chain - ranging from media use to agenda-setting, from agenda-setting to attitudes strength, and from attitudes strength to engagement - was significant. Indirect and total effects of agenda-setting for political and civic participation were all found to be significant. Agenda-setting effects operated as a mediator between media use and civic engagement, as hypothesized."

is explicitly against capitalist modes of production. However, punk cultures are able to exist through the direct engagement of such modes of production. By focusing on the role of different media technologiesmost importantly MySpacein the construction and
reproduction of underground punk infrastructures, I examine the tense relationships that make it possible for counter-hegemonic cultural formations to navigate within and, most importantly, negotiate capitalism. I focus on the case of the Puerto Rico punk media-culture in order to foreground the impact of digital media technologies in redirecting our attention from a dichotomous conception of resistance toward a more dynamic, complex, and problematic conception of opposition in which articulations of cultural space, rather than the unambiguous toppling of power, take a leading role."
2009-0601,Functional Analyses of Political Leaders' Debates around the World,"Keywords: Culture, Communication Competence, and Intercultural Communication (Cross Unit)",,,,Paper,Functional Analyses of Political Leaders' Debates around the World,"Keywords: Culture, Communication Competence, and Intercultural Communication (Cross Unit)","Political leaders' debates are important campaign message forms used in many countries to inform voters and to provide leading candidates with an opportunity to persuade voters. The Functional Theory of Political Campaign Discourse has been employed to content analyze political leaders' debates in a variety of countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the Ukraine, and the United States. This paper integrates data from these studies to investigate the functions and topics across countries and cultures. Although there are important differences (e.g., the South Korean political system limits presidents to a single term and does not have a vice president, which limits the importance of incumbency in presidential elections), there are common features in these debates (more frequent use of positive than negative statements; greater emphasis on policy than character). These commonalities suggest that some aspects of the basic campaign situation - candidates attempting to persuade voters of their preferability over opponents - transcend political and cultural differences. This paper will relate to a) intercultural communication b) culture and language (perhaps identity) c) social interaction and language (as well as facework)."

This study is the first step in establishing what is going on in Chinese news media in terms of j-blogs and finding out how new technology would change and transform the traditional news industry in Mainland China. Content analysis was conducted to study j-blogs on Chinese newspaper websites and investigate their implications for journalism in China. Topic, format, reader comments, hyperlinks and multimedia such as video, audio and pictures in j-blog posts were analyzed.
It was revealed that the most often addressed topics in Chinese j-blogs were lifestyle, politics/government/military, crime/accidents/disasters, and business/economic activity. The most frequently adopted formats in Chinese j-blogs were the straight opinion column, the rumor-mill blog, and reporters notebook of news tidbits and incidentals. It was shown that the formats of j-blog posts varied by topics. Significant influence of topic and format were found on the number of reader comments in Chinese j-blog posts. The use of hyperlinks and multimedia also differed in j-blogs with different topics and formats."
2009-0603,Games and Recovery: The Use of Video and Computer Games to Recuperate from Stress and Strain,Reactions to Bad Things Happening,,,,Paper,Games and Recovery: The Use of Video and Computer Games to Recuperate from Stress and Strain,Reactions to Bad Things Happening,"In an online survey of 1614 participants, the use of video and computer games for recovery purposes was investigated. The data indicate that computer games are systematically used after exposure to stressful situations and strain and that recovery experience is a significant facet of the gaming experience. Using structural equation modelling, the relations among work-related fatigue, daily hassles, social support, coping style, recovery experience, and the use of computer games for recovery purposes were tested. Persons who associated stronger recovery experiences with game play used video and computer games more often after stressful and exhausting situations. Additionally, participants level of work-related fatigue and exposure to daily hassles were both positively associated with the use of computer games for recovery. Participants with emotion focussed coping style showed a higher tendency to use games for recovery, than participants with problem focussed coping style. The relationship between work-related fatigue and game use for recovery purposes was moderated by social support. The stress buffering function of video and computer games was more important for participants receiving less social support. These participants showed a stronger relation between work-related fatigue and the use of games for recovery than participants receiving more social support."
2009-0604,Games at Work: The Recreational Use of Computer Games During Working Hours,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,,,,Paper,Games at Work: The Recreational Use of Computer Games During Working Hours,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,"The present study investigated the use of video and computer games at the workplace. In an online survey, 833 employed users of online casual games reported on their use of computer games during working hours. The data indicate that playing computer games at the workplace elicits substantial levels of recovery experience. Using structural equation modelling, the relations among recovery experience during gameplay, work-related fatigue, social support at work, job-control and the use of computer games during working hours were tested. Recovery experience associated to gameplay was the strongest predictor for the use of games at the workplace. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of work-related fatigue reported stronger recovery experience during gameplay and showed a higher tendency to play games during working hours than persons with lower levels of work strain. Additionally, the social situation at work was found to have a significant influence on the use of games. Persons receiving less social support from colleagues and supervisors played games at work more frequently than individuals with higher levels of social support. Furthermore, job-control was positively related to the use of games at work. In sum, the results of the present study illustrate that computer games have a significant recovery potential. In light of the presented data, the primarily negative perspective applied by existing research on personal media use at the workplace appears incomplete and should be complemented by research on the potential positive effects of entertaining media use at work."
2009-0605,Gaming Across Different Consoles: Exploring the Influence of Control Scheme on Game Player Enjoyment,and Out of Control,,,,Paper,Gaming Across Different Consoles: Exploring the Influence of Control Scheme on Game Player Enjoyment,In and Out of Control,"Many studies have investigated how different technological features impact the experience of playing video games, yet few have specifically focused on how control schemes from different game consoles may be affecting the game play experience. This research employed a between subjects design to explore the relationship between type of game console played (Nintendo Wii, Playstation 2) and participant gender (male, female) on feelings of flow during game play and enjoyment of the overall experience. Results indicated that both males and females reported greater feelings of control and enjoyment with a traditional control scheme (Playstation 2) than the more technologically advanced control scheme (Nintendo Wii). Although female participants generally felt less in control of their play experiences and reported less overall enjoyment than males, the primary effects of console and control scheme were consistent across gender. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Analysis of sourcing patterns and sound bite length indicate the debate was dominated by conventionally straight perspectives. While gay and lesbian couples were visually prevalent in news stories, they were largely seen and not heard. Scrutinizing the visual narratives about gay and lesbian life in television news reports, this study found gay and lesbian representation was largely normalized and mainstreamed in typically heteronormative ways."
2009-0607,Gender Attribution in Online Video Games,Game Studies: Examining Group Play,,,,Paper,Gender Attribution in Online Video Games,Game Studies: Examining Group Play,"This research identifies two determinants of perceived gender of online video game players, player skill and game genre, through the results of two separate experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrates that both game genre and player skill have a significant effect on perception of player maleness, such that skilled players of typically masculine game genres (i.e., shooting games) are considered more male than unskilled players of less traditionally male games (i.e. puzzle games). Experiment 2 partially replicates these results, demonstrating a significant effect for game genre on perceptions of player maleness, and a rank-order of the interaction between genre and player skill in determining player gender. Results from both experiments suggest the presence of a perceptual bias in online games, in that all players are assumed to be more male than female. These findings are discussed in terms of relevant gaming literature as well as computer-mediated communication (CMC) research on online gender perception."
2009-0608,Gender Differences in Motivational Activation,Keywords in Information Systems: Motivation (High Density),,,,Paper,Gender Differences in Motivational Activation,Keywords in Information Systems: Motivation (High Density),"This study reports on gender differences in resting levels of motivational activation as measured by the short version of the Motivational Activation Measure (mini-MAM). MAM produces two measures, one, called PO, is an indicator of individual differences in appetitive (approach) motivational activation. The other, called NB, is an indicator of individual differences in aversive (avoid) motivational activation. These measures have been shown to be related to the sensation seeking personality trait, substance use, and many aspects of media use and processing. This paper examines whether PO and NB are distributed differently across genders and if their relationships with sensation seeking, media behavior, and substance use vary as a function of gender.
Results show that men have higher levels of PO than women and that women have higher levels of NB than men. In addition, more women fall into the high NB/low PO (called risk avoiders) group and more men fall into the high PO/lowNB (called risk takers) group. In addition, the relationships between PO and NB and substance use and sensation seeking are stronger for women then for men. Results also show that NB reduces the length of time spent viewing emotional pictures more for men than for women and this difference is a function of PO."
2009-0609,"Gender Differences in Valence in ""Real"" and ""Fake"" Violent Images",Keywords in Information Systems: Framing (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,"Gender Differences in Valence in ""Real"" and ""Fake"" Violent Images",Keywords in Information Systems: Framing (High Density),"This study will investigate two different topics that have been examined separately in the past. The first topic involves the differences in gender in relation to valence toward violent/gory images. The second topic looks at subjects valence toward violent/gory images that they are told are either real or fake (e.g. stage make-up, Photoshop). This study combines these two topics into one larger, more inclusive topic. Studies in the past have shown that women have different physiological and emotional responses toward certain images when compared to men (Campanella, et al., 2004; Flaisch et al., 2003; Lee, et al., 2002; Wrase et al., 2003), which might imply and could be explained by gender differences in empathy. Furthermore, studies also suggest that subjects are less adverse to violent/gory images if they are told the images are fake as opposed to real (Oliveira et al., 2003; Pastor et al., 2003). What this new study will investigate, among other topics, is if females are more adverse to fake violent images then males. This study predicts the following: 1) that viewing the images within the fake condition will result in less negative responses for both men and women, than in the real condition, 2) exposure to the real condition will not differ significantly between males and females, 3) males exposed to the fake condition will have significantly higher positive valence scores when compared to females, and 4) males exposed to the fake condition will have significantly lower negative valence scores when compared to females."

This study explores gender differences within 74.5 hours of the NBCs 2008 primetime Olympic telecasts in terms of (a) raw exposure [clock-time devoted to each gender] and (b) sportscaster dialogue [descriptions of success, failure, personality, and personality ascribed to men and women athletes]. Results indicate that the gap between men and womens sports clock-time is widening [an 8.4% differential compared to a 4.6% differential in the 2004 Athens Games]. In addition, seven significant dialogue differences were detected between men and women athletes."

Using textual analysis of local newspapers, it found that there are cultural differences that influence how the papers framed these womens shows of emotions. For Germanys Angela Merkel, her expressiveness is a brief part of the color of the story. In the case of Chiles Michelle Bachelet, her emotions serve as the main explanation of her appeal to voters. In the United States, Hillary Clinton is deemed as showing too much ambition to get to the White House."
2009-0612,Gender in Political News Reportage: Messenger and Message,Gender and Politics,,,,Paper,Gender in Political News Reportage: Messenger and Message,Gender and Politics,"This study examines gender differences among network television reporters during four presidential elections (1992 - 2004). Three existing explanatory models for gender influence in the workplace (traditional, feminist, and job) predict contradictory outcomes on how news operations as well as journalistic self-representation and reportage on candidates might vary across gender. In the competitive and masculine work environment of network television election coverage the feminist model forecasts that female reporters in an attempt to counter gender discrimination would be more aggressive in their reportage than their male counterparts. By contrast, the traditional model suggests that women would take a more passive and feminine approach to reportage than men. The job model proposes an outcome of no gender difference based on the notion that professional socialization of journalists trumps gender influences. Overall, the findings reported here show persistent gender differences among network news correspondents. Although there were fewer women than men reporters involved in election coverage, on average women reported more stories than men. Moreover, women were tonally more aggressive in reportage than men. In terms of framing candidates, men were more gendered in their approach than women. In fact, male reporters were strongly associated with covering election news in a masculine frame, emphasizing power struggles and competitiveness. On the other hand, women were less overtly gendered in their approach to reporting on candidates by employing both more feminine human-interest and gender-neutral frames than men. These findings call for a more nuanced and dynamic models for explaining gender variance in news reportage."

In 1999 a law proposal on gender quotas in politics failed to be approved and in 2006 the issue returned to parliament to be then approved.
The controversial nature of quotas is best seen when projected onto the media public sphere. Our work approaches the op-ed pages and national print news to uncover the empirical workings of the public sphere understood in habermasian terms. The analysis is guided by the insights of those who have worked on the issue of parity such as Pietra Meier and Mieke Verloo, as well as of those who have considered the ideological power of language. It will show that the debates were driven and defined by the elites and left largely untouched the wider causes for a gender unbalance in politics."

Nevertheless, we lack extensive international analyses. In the largest study so far a sample of 19,664 programmes of childrens television from 24 countries was collected and analysed by an international team of more than 35 scholars. The analyses offer an overview on what childrens TV offers to 2-to-12-year-olds worldwide: channels broadcast mainly animated fictional programmes which are at an average of 60% across all countries produced in North America. In the quantitative content analysis of the 26,342 fictional characters significant gender tendencies were found: especially the 14,959 human characters showed similar tendencies all over the world, a dominance of Caucasian-white, non-disabled male characters. Alongside questions of content, methodical questions and limits which arose in this international study, are issues that will be discussed in this paper."

Theory is first discussed in terms of how social gender influences our virtual behavior and by this the use of information and communication platforms and second, in what ways and to what extend technology shapes human behavior. Gender differences are explored by a content analysis of four information and communication platforms looking at four different aspects: language use, choice of topic, participation and involvement, and access to platforms. In addition, interviewed experts were asked for their long-time experiences (and observations) on gender-specific online communication and interaction. Analyses reveal gender differences in all four categories that hinder women using the new social software. Based on the findings, the author has found 10 strategies (Undoing-Gender-Actions ) giving guidance and advice for the implementation and use of information and communication platforms to avoid gender-specific barriers in communication and interaction."

The aim of this panel study of the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Summer Games is to identify potential trends with respect to the differential visual representation of male and female athletes. The analysis of three culturally diverse media powers, Brazil (Latin America), Germany (Europe) and the USA (North America), allows for the investigation of culture-specific versus global patterns and ultimately for the identification of potential trends of global convergence. The study consists of four parts: (1) a brief introduction to the subject and history of the Olympic Games; (2) the presentation of prior research findings with respect to stereotypical portrayals of female athletes in Olympic online visuals; (3) the presentation of the methodology, analysis and findings of the cross-cultural panel study; (4) a discussion and conclusion pointing out future directions for research."

The influence of genetics on bipolarity indicates the relevance of disclosure of bipolarity within families. Past research has indicated that such disclosure does not occur with the frequency that would be suggested by genetic patterns, and also indicates the difficulty that occurs for individuals when they develop symptoms of bipolarity in instances when family members have not disclosed their bipolarity to others in the family. Grounded in Communication Privacy Management Theory, the present study built on earlier research to examine disclosure patterns relating to bipolarity dependent upon the generational structure of the family in terms of bipolarity. Is disclosure of bipolarity affected by whether ones parent, child, or both have been diagnosed as or are suspected of having bipolar? Participants were obtained from websites for individuals who are bipolar and their family members. The survey instrument examined disclosure of various aspects of behavior related to bipolarity. The results indicate that the key factors affecting disclosure seem to be uncertainty, protection, identity, and stigma management. The more generations within a family that are bipolar, the more the topic is discussed. Growing up with a bipolar parent seemed to show a respondent the importance of talking about bipolarity. Uncertainty became particularly relevant when a family member was suspected of being bipolar but had not been diagnosed. Protection became particularly relevant when a parent feared that a child could be genetically predisposed to bipolarity. Protection overrode uncertainty, identity, and stigma concerns."

Country, hip-hop and punk are examples of international or out-group genres for German listeners, while German folksy music serves as an example of domestic in-group music. Results revealed significant differences between the genres in seven out of eight concepts measured: urban vs. rural culture, age, trustworthiness, expertise, attractiveness, friendliness, and political ideology. There was no significant difference in the eighth concept: ethnicity. Some differences between the genre stimuli were noted in mood valence, mood intensity, and listeners music identity/preference. Controlling for identity with the stimulus reduced the genre differences in trustworthiness to marginal significance. It also lowered the effect size for several other concepts, but they still remained statistically significant. In-group vs. out-group theory at a cultural level is proposed as an explanation for the differences in cognitive schemas for these genres."

American observers were asked to view a series of video clips of speakers telling a story from their own life in Korean and English, and then rate the truthfulness of speakers. The Korean version of a story was translated into English by voice-over and subtitles. Observers were randomly assigned into three conditions: 1) English voice-over of Korean-speaking, 2) English subtitles over Korean-speaking and 3) English-speaking only. The results showed that observers tended to be sensitive to different audiovisual modes for credibility judgment; that is, Korean speakers in English subtitles and voice-over condition were judged as more truthful than English-speaking condition. The issue of media modality and credibility related to translation modes was discussed."

Although it has become conventional to note preoccupation with the body in girl zines, I want to take a different tack by exploring the kinds of bodies girls envisioned in reaction to control and violence they experienced in their daily lives and in popular culture. Recognizing that their bodies were being organized and disciplined precisely as the bodies of girls-destined-to-become-women, girls responded by trying to imagine bodies that were either differently gendered or even beyond gender. They also tried to imagine different corporeal forms--forms less individual and less bounded by the limits of the skin and the skeleton than porous, intersubjective, and deeply relational. In the end, I am interested in how girls attempted to re-imagine and re-work the individual body as a collective social form."

This simple injunction resulted in a sea change in the analysis of popular communication several decades ago, displacing the once-dominant textual analysis to embrace questions of audience interpretation. This in turn was the Trojan horse that let in contextualisation, diversification, globalisation and, some say, empiricism, to the study of popular culture. By interviewing people individually and collectively, in front of and away from the screen, researchers discovered that audiences did not agree with the textual analysts postulating about inscribed subjects and implied readers. Nor indeed did they agree with each other. Audiences became plural, unpredictable, indeterminate. Researchers set aside familiar humanistic tools (structuralism, semiotics, literary theory), turning to the social sciences for new skills in interviewing (and sampling, recruitment, ethics, etc). This paper asks, was it the interview that transformed popular communication studies? And how could it be done better?"
2009-0624,Giving Goffmans Gender Advertisements a Second Look in Light of Consumer Culture,Communication Approaches to the Study of Consumer Culture,,,,Paper,Giving Goffmans Gender Advertisements a Second Look in Light of Consumer Culture,Communication Approaches to the Study of Consumer Culture,"In the three decades since Erving Goffman published Gender Advertisements, the landscape of gender and gender representations, it would seem, have transformed significantly. Queer lives and lifestyles, the public/media expression of girls and womens empowerment and the figure of the metrosexual male represent some of the more publicly shared gender images unavailable when Goffman was writing. As well, uneven changes in womens economic status and power, structural changes in economic relations and the proliferation of electronic and digital media have made gender both visible and invisible in new ways.
Drawing on advertisements taken from a sampling of a variety of magazines in the US, this paper re-examines, extends and rethinks Goffman's analysis. Goffmanas well as recent re-analyses of his constructssidesteps and ultimately discounts the commercial basis of gender depiction appearing as they do as advertisements in magazines. The paper examines these portrayals in the context of consumer culture, introducing for instance the concept of market weight to help account for representations as opposed to Goffmans notion of social weight."""
2009-0625,Global Audiences,Provincializing Media Studies,,,,Paper,Global Audiences,Provincializing Media Studies,"Globalization has encouraged many scholars, policy makers, and popular commentators to portray audiences as equal opportunity consumers of a diverse array of media artifacts from around the world. Hollywood movies, Mexican telenovelas, and Indian musicals are often invoked as prominent examples of the global media smorgasbord laid out before contemporary viewers. Although it is indeed true that media products often attract surprisingly diverse and far-flung audiences, it is important to understand that media companies have a far more restricted ensemble of viewers in mind when they develop and distribute their products. They think not in terms of an expansive global audience but rather in terms of fairly specific commercial markets. For example, Hollywood producers and distributors derive more than 70% of their overseas income from Western Europe and Japan. Although they may envision future growth in other markets, such as China and India, these locations figure only minimally in their global strategies. Similarly, media industries in Bombay, Miami, and Dubai all operate as transnational media providers, but the contours of their target audiences are shaped less by global ambition than by commercial calculation with respect to particular territories. This presentation explores the implications of commercial constructions of the transnational media audience."

This study explores how Disneys global corporate cultural capital, as its brand baggage, like its storytelling strategy, inherited cartoon characters, and multinational corporate culture, functions as a drag on glocalization  a notion of cultural and economic actions to capture the global-local dialectics that affects Disneys contingency ability.

An in-depth cultural analysis of Hong Kong Disneyland's television commercial (TVC) to promote its new attraction The Main Street Haunted Hotel during the Halloween Festival in the context of the postmodern Chinese society of Hong Kong reflects the challenge that Disneyland is facing: how to meet with the competitive pressure posed by a local player and how to protect the cultural integrity of Disney as a global brand. On the one hand, instead of carrying the widely accepted Disney characters, this TVC unprecedentedly incorporates many horrifying and thrilling elements which are at odds with Disneylands traditional association with children, family and clean wholesome fun. On the other, in spite of intensive local competition, it continues to embrace American cultural representation and to utilize the standardized storytelling and promotion strategy historically developed by Disney. This reveals a lower flexibility in contingency planning by a multinational corporation like Disney in the global culture-economic competition."

There are two stages of this global debate: intergovernmental and civil society. Intergovernmental efforts reached an impasse when crippled by cold war pressures and the politicization of the right to communicate. Once the domain of governmental actors, when the right to communicate was no longer on the agenda in intergovernmental platforms, civil society stepped in to promote communication rights. Many non-governmental organizations came together under the umbrella of communication rights. The Communication Rights in the Information Society (CRIS) campaign is investigated as a specific case study of transnational collective action for communication rights since it is a visible example of a global expression of the right to communicate movement."
2009-0630,"Globalization, Regulatory Competition, and Audiovisual Regulation: The French, German, and UK Cases",Liberalization and Policy Reform: International Perspectives,,,,Paper,"Globalization, Regulatory Competition, and Audiovisual Regulation: The French, German, and UK Cases",Liberalization and Policy Reform: International Perspectives,"Looking at France, Germany and the UK, the paper examines the impact of globalization, new media and deregulatory pressures on national cultural policy toolkits for the television sector, namely public service broadcasting, media ownership rules, subsidies and investment and scheduling quotas. There is evidence of competitiveness motivated deregulation of media ownership rules in all three cases. Other than that though, the countries cultural policy toolkits appear robust and demonstrate a striking degree of path dependent policy-making. Some aspects of UK television policy are certainly redolent of deregulatory competition and the UK approach has progressively relieved the private sector of the kind of regulatory burdens imposed by the French approach. Similarly, when private commercial television was introduced in the mid 1980s the subsequent decade saw fierce regulatory competition between the German Länder to attract media investment, leaving the private sector comparatively free of regulatory obligations. Yet, in the UK and Germany public service broadcasting, the principal element of the cultural policy toolkit, has remained comparatively well resourced. The French case is a paradox. The adaptation of the protectionist French system of programme quotas and subsidies to the digital age could be seen as upward regulation. France exhibits a particularly strong political commitment to a distinctive and elaborate regulatory and interventionist cultural policy toolkit. It has aggressively championed a global struggle to defend national cultural identities in the face of the domination of American production. Yet, public service television and national television production are weak in comparison with its more liberal neighbours."
2009-0631,Globalizing Media Law and Policy,Policy and Global Communication: International Law and Communication Rights,,,,Paper,Globalizing Media Law and Policy,Policy and Global Communication: International Law and Communication Rights,"Communication networks have long provoked the development of new forms of transnational governance, including both the first international organization (the ITU, to regulate the telegraph, in the 1860s) and the first global organization with regulatory-like powers (ICANN, to manage the internet, in the 1990s). The impact of globalization on the law is most visible in institutions and contractual activity at the global level, but goes far beyond. The modes of policy transfer and coordination through which the legal dimension of globalization is accomplished are referred to as policy convergence; harmonization occurs when these processes result in conformance of the laws of multiple states with each other. Although the global information infrastructure has been essential to globalization of the law, analysis of processes of policy convergence underway across the legal landscape generates a matrix in which most cells are devoid of any research on communication law and regulation. This paper introduces the processes involved, identifies sources of resistance to these processes, and explores the implications of these developments for theory, research, and pedagogy involving media law. The research agenda that results is critical from the political perspective, for legal historians believe that the processes underway are generating a transformation of state-society-law relations as profound as those that played out 500 years ago when the international system itself was formed."

In Search of a Theoretical Base,"Globalizing Journalism: Where, How, How Much, So What?","Kai Hafez will ask whether the seeming transnationals like CNN, BBC or Al Jazeera can be considered the vanguard of global journalism or whether this is premature. Interrogating the various levels of journalism, he will ask: since all content is national, what will qualify some items for global journalism? Is transnationalization of ownership what makes content global? If reporters and editors are drawn from many different cultures, are they required to follow a predominantly white middle class agenda? What of audience size and composition: are local and national elites helped to become global elites, what will global journalism do for the rest?
Mainstream journalism is still firmly entrenched in nationalistic and particularistic visions of the world--- satellites do not determine an increase in global awareness or intertextuality. So what is global journalism, where can it be found, and more apropos, what is good global journalism? The presentation will reflect on social and cultural theory from global governance, political systems and civil society to specify conditions for global journalism in terms of content, reporters, audiences, and markets. This framework will be used to evaluate whether the foreign reporting of big transnational news organizations live up to those standards."

The entrance of these global media is relatively new. Most countries protected their local magazine industries until the 1990s when liberalization and open door policies allowed for the entry of foreign titles. Before the 1990s, magazines reflected local themes and content. Today, however, these glossy international magazines compete with local magazines for advertising revenue and this competition is changing the content and structure of local magazines. I would like to talk about how I use global magazines in my classes to stimulate debate on the spread of global consumer culture."

To explore this question, this paper compared the use of attacks on German party Web sites in two state elections, one national election, and one European parliamentary election with recent American evidence. The results show that virtual mudslinging has affected German e-campaigns on all levels of the political system, with patterns similar to those found in the United States. This includes the amount and frequency of the attacks as well as their differential usage by incumbents and challengers, their respective sources, and the subject dimensions of the assaults. Only with regard to the thematic context and the targets of the attacks did German and American e-campaigns vary in their style of online negativism. These findings support the notion of a global standardization effect in Web campaign practices brought about by the professionalization process in politics."

The Lure and Hazards of Comparative Research on Audiences,"Cross-National Comparative Research in Question: Challenges of Theory, Method, and Contextualization","The growing prominence of media globalisation and transnational audience flows, along with the theory that frames and interprets these developments, has led audience researchers increasingly to conduct large scale comparative projects. In so doing, they encounter significant challenges in terms of methodology, contextualisation, funding and collaborative practice. Two main forms of research have emerged, each with different strengths; first, the cross-national comparison of matched studies and, partly in response to the charge of methodological nationalism levied at such studies, second, the cross-border mapping of transnational flows. Both approaches struggle with the appeal of attaining global (or at least regional) scope, speaking no longer for audiences in one country but rather for audiences worldwide. And both must address, if not necessarily the claims of radical contextualism, at least sufficient contextualism for findings to be valid and meaningful. Through an examination of selected studies, each a prototypical exemplar of comparative research, this paper will consider the pressing epistemological and methodological challenges facing audience research (including mass media reception studies, the practices and literacies of new media users, and childrens responses to their changing media environment). It will conclude with a comment on best practice as this is emerging from the experiences of researchers worldwide."

Specifically, it investigates to what extent global visual culture influences peoples creation of visual messages. The research presented is innovative in that it focuses on peoples visual representation of global reality.
I focus on a portion of data collected as part of a larger study during fieldwork for my PhD on Universal Visual Communication. I here analyze 200 images drawn by 100 participants from five different countries. Participants drawings are in response to instructions asking to depict individual representations of global artifacts such as a (1) drink sold in fast food restaurant; and an internationally telemediated (2) global media event from the last ten years.
My preliminary findings suggest that exposure to a common global visual culture gives rise to similar patterns of visual expressions cross-culturally. Moreover, the differences noted are age-related rather than linked to participants cultural background. I conclude by discussing the importance of age in the patterns noted here as well as the relationship between global visual culture and universal patterns of visual communication."

As stated by Wheeler [o]penings are opportunities. They are critical moments in which mood is set, issues are framed, and relationships established (Wheeler, 2004, p. 167). Prior research has hinted as to what should be included in mediator introductions, yet limited research has addressed this unique environment. Building on prior research (e.g., Szmania, 2006; Umbreit, 2001), the goal of this study is to fill the gap of what is actually happening during mediator introductions by exploring what types of interactions are present as well as how the communicative environment is established for the ensuing mediation.

Ten mediation cases conducted at the Conflict Resolution Center (CRC) of a large Southwestern University were used to develop a data-driven code list to assess which elements are present during mediation introductions. While elements have the capacity to describe what is occurring during mediation introductions, they do not reflect the communicative environment. To address this issue, an emergent themes approach was taken to investigate which themes surface across mediators talk. In other words, our focus was to determine how micro-level communicative themes create the macro-level communicative environment of mediation introductions.

Results from the current study indicate that the ability of the mediators to package structural themes with relational themes sets a more productive tone for the remaining session. Implications for these findings, as well as limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed."

Variations in visual design and layout patterns between local sites are also explored. The content analysis of visual elements on 265 local and parent Web sites is guided by conceptions of culture clustering and visual design. A national similarity index (NSI) shows ranges in similarity between the visual cues used by parent company Web sites and their local counterparts. Cluster analysis points toward common visual design and layout trends among local Web sites belonging to the same groupings. Japan and Spain represent outlier nations from clusters for their geographic regions. Visual design groupings offer useful insights for future glocal brand Web site design and layout efforts pursuing a relevant local design that also seek to preserve the global brand."

In Chile, however, the opposite belief prevails, based upon a reading of the 1988 plebiscite that inaugurated Chile's transition to democracy. In this election, the democratic opposition defeated General Pinochet with a highly positive campaign focused on national reconciliation, in stark contrast to the military government's relentless attacks on their center-left opponents. Based on content analysis of campaign television advertising and a matching analysis of post-electoral survey data, I examine the effect of exposure to these positive and negative messages on vote choice in the Chile's 1988 plebiscite. This paper contributes to the literature on media and voting behavior, which has generally been skeptical of media effects, as well as to the ongoing debate about the impact of positive versus negative advertising across different political contexts."

Employing Williams structure of feeling, the paper examines the role of affect in the ways that print journalists are experiencing these transformations. The perspectives of journalists are incorporated through an analysis of the final goodbye letters, emails, speeches and columns that journalists who have either been laid off, been forced out, or have taken buyouts as part of the economic downsizing facing newsrooms. Notably, we discover that print journalists are wedded to what we identify as Fordist ideal of journalism that reifies stability within the industry and journalists as the mediators between the powerful and the public at large. Interestingly, journalists blame the problems of the industry on Wall Street, failing to self-reflexively examine the role of their own occupational values and practices."

A Content Analysis of Profanity in Video Games and its Prevalence Across Game Systems and Ratings,Game Studies Poster Session,"Although violent video game content and its effects have been examined extensively by empirical research, verbal aggression in the form of profanity has received less attention. Building on preliminary findings from previous studies, an extensive content analysis of profanity in video games was conducted using a sample of the 150 top-selling video games across all popular game platforms (including home consoles, portable consoles, and personal computers) at the time the sample was taken (133 games after removing some duplicate game versions made for different platforms). The frequency of profanity, both in general and across three profanity categories, was measured and compared to games ratings, sales, and platforms. Generally, profanity was found in only about one in five games, and appeared primarily in games rated for teenagers or above. Games containing profanity, however, tended to contain it frequently. Profanity was not found to be related to games sales or platforms."

The Influence of Organizational Communication Strategies to Refocus Users Expectations on Information Sharing Systems.,Keywords in Information Systems: Persuasion (High Density),"Information sharing systems (ISS) are crucial for modern organizations. Yet ISS will rarely, if ever, hold all relevant information. Such lack of information is likely to be considered as system weakness and could cause user frustration. The current study is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). It examines if information about system weaknesses given to potential users before first usage can help to reduce dissatisfaction by refocusing user expectations. In an experiment with 170 participants, organizational communication strategy (no announcement vs. announcement of potential system weakness) was manipulated. Dependent variables included expectation confirmation, usefulness of ISS, user satisfaction, and intended system usage. The results fully support the hypotheses. If users do not expect to find all important information in an ISS, they perceive the system as more useful, are more satisfied with the system, and have stronger intentions to use that system in the future."

Billed as an easy, hassle-free way to gather and organized ones medical records, Google Healths claimed purpose is to put you in charge of your health information. It purported to rescue individuals from the inconvenience, and some time oppression, of medical institutions by putting them in control of their data. This was the latest development in Health 2.0: a growing effort to marry Web 2.0 technology, participatory discourse, and network mentality to health care and management. Health 2.0 makes a proposition that access to more medical information leads to greater control over ones health and that, combined, control and information rescues individuals from institutional power. This presentation will argue that the promise of Health 2.0 model obscures the rise of network power: a system that functions through production of freedom, participation, and information."

The underlying assumption of the government communication decision wheel is that the environment (i.e., government or corporate) in which public relations practitioners operate has tangible influences on communication practices and professional development opportunities. Therefore, government public relations practices are worthy of study independent from the prevailing corporate public relations models and theories. This study identified five significant differences between government and corporate public relations practices related to message dissemination strategies (legal frameworks; politics; media coverage; federalism; and publics information needs), but did not find any differences related to professional development opportunities. The study concludes by recommending additional avenues of research to further test the government communication decision wheel."

The argument here, however, is that they are neither. This paper seeks to provide a richer theoretical framework for assessing some of the critical distinctions, not just between the so-called real and the fake, but among various manifestations of public affairs television. I argue that we can define three forms of television news: the ""high-modern,"" the ""postmodern,"" and in the case of TDS and Colbert, the ""neo-modern."" To explicate these three approaches to informational programming, this paper charts the differences among their formal characteristics, their modes of publicity, the models of democracy they in turn articulate, and ultimately, the understandings of citizenship they help to construct."

In addition, current body of literature on social support groups lacks systematic review of the knowledge gained from studies conducted in various disciplines. To this end, the present paper sought to synthesize available knowledge across a broad range of disciplines to formulate a clearer picture on the underlying mechanisms or communicative processes producing both function and dysfunction of social support groups. From an extensive review on literature, five major communication processes or sources of positive outcomes are identified: 1) Boost of personal competence by helping others, 2) instillation of hope, 3) universality and normalization of the situation, 4) uncertainty management, and 5) emotional ventilation. More importantly, the paper also presents six major communication processes or sources that produce dysfunctions in social support groups. They include 1) discrepancy between outcomes expected and obtained, 2) inappropriate enactment of leadership, 3) formation of negative group identity, 4) instillation of negative prospect of future, 5) evaluation apprehension, and 6) limited communicative competency. Implications of the findings are discussed."

By challenging heterosexualitys taken-for-granted status as natural and morally superior, gays and lesbians have (perhaps only temporarily and certainly only partially) destabilized heteronormativity. In doing so, they have made it at least possible to envision alternative ways to thinks about straight masculinity and to organize (hetero)sexual identities, desires, and behaviors. Here I explore how recent U.S. television programming trends (e.g., Scrubs, Boston Legal, The Today Show) reveal a culture negotiating what it means to be a straight man in a gay-friendly world. At my most provocative, I want to suggest that such images can help us imagine the possibility of a future in which being gay and straight are disarticulated from sexin which a self-identified straight man could enjoy sex with other men and not have his straight identity ever be in question. I offer this argument not because I think such future is inevitable (I doubt that it is even likely) nor that it would be free of heterosexism (I doubt it would be). Instead, I offer it as a critical stance against the profound ambiguity and winking irony that marks so many of these texts."

An increasing quantity of mobile situations accompanies the mediatization of everyday life (Krotz 2001, 2007). The study is about how experiences with mobility affect the thinking and behavior of people in their everyday activities. Therefore the method of ethnographical go-along allowed following people through their daily routines. But the focus was not only on the single situations. Bourdieus (1987, 1996) concept of Habitus explains how people internalize thoughts, feelings, tastes and experiences. Although the Habitus becomes obvious in situational behavior it is a lifelong process. Based on the theoretical assumptions and empirical findings a model of habitualized mobility illustrates how a mobile Habitus allows people to act flexible in new media situations."

By shifting the focus of family values rhetoric from the importance of two-parent families to the necessity of having both mother-love and father-love in a childs life, conservative advocates of traditional marriage seek to disqualify same-sex families from the start. This shift also allows conservative activists to draw from a broad array of their previous arguments against divorce and nontraditional family structures, particularly single-parent households. Their focus on gender reveals key ideological underpinnings of the rhetoric of family values, and reflects conservative activists deeper anxieties over the loss of traditional gender roles and the instability of gender identity in contemporary society. This paper explores how gender and sexuality are articulated through one another in the debate over same-sex marriage. It begins with a discussion of the essentialism that informs traditional gender roles, and then analyzes how this essentialism is deployed and contested in the same-sex marriage debate. It concludes by considering the rhetorical challenge faced by advocates of same-sex marriage, who must contest gender essentialism while arguing for an innate conception of sexual identity."

This article examines explanations offered in media research for these two journalistic forms and their connection to gender. I suggest that such understandings are flawed due to the grounding of both gender and news in patriarchal essentialist assumptions. In order to confront patriarchalism, a new conceptualization is proposed for 'hard'/'soft' news. I submit that the distinction between 'hard' and 'soft' news in the journalistic text is a discursive mechanism that links two central components: the source of the newsworthiness attributed to events; and the gender identity attributed to the imaginary community of the media organization. The exposure of this discursive mechanism reveals in a critical manner the seemingly automatic connection between 'hard' news and masculinity and between 'soft' news and femininity, while questioning the tendency among many feminist studies to attribute a positive value to the process of 'news softening.'"

These elements are owner contributions, raw materials, miscellaneous supplies, and labor. The present study looks at changes in the nations newspaper readership and confidence in the press over the last 30 years, based on changes in the newspaper workforce. Data from the General Social Survey and the American Society of Newspaper Editors census were used to see how increases (or decreases) in overall staffing and minority staffing from the previous year related to national and minority readership and press confidence in that next year. Results suggest that investing in workforce, and in minority workforce especially, might be the answer to declining readership and press confidence across the board. These relationships are discussed within the context of market position harvesting, disruptive technologies such as the Internet, and Jurgensmeyers Influence Model."

The author pays special attention to the ways in which the concentration of creative talent in Havana, in addition to industrial, legal, economic, and cultural factors, fostered the growth of Cubas commercial broadcasting. As well, the paper traces Havana media connections across the region and conflictive economic, industrial, and political moments that provoked the migration of Cuban media professionals to various Latin American countries before the 1959 Cuban revolution. The project argues that during the 1940s and 1950s Havana was one of the most important commercial broadcasting centers in the region, an aspect that facilitated the incorporation of Cuban exiles into the Latin American and US Spanish-language media workforce during the 1960s and 1970s."
2009-0658,"Health Belief Model in Healthcare Settings: Knowledge, Perceived Effectiveness, and Cues to Action on Staff Behaviors*",Communication in Healthcare Organizations,,,,Paper,"Health Belief Model in Healthcare Settings: Knowledge, Perceived Effectiveness, and Cues to Action on Staff Behaviors*",Communication in Healthcare Organizations,"The goal of present study is to employ the theoretical framework of Health Belief Model (HBM) in order to (a) theoretically explicate direct and indirect effect of knowledge on benefits, barriers, and cues to action; and (b) test for the contribution of non-linear relationships in cost effectiveness of HBM in nosocomial transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) preventive behaviors. Findings indicate while greater knowledge leads to lower perception of benefits; it has no significant effect on barriers and behaviors. Benefits and barriers influence staff preventive behaviors significantly and study finds significant multiplicative effect of perceived barriers. Additionally findings indicate significant indirect role of cues to action mediating the effect of benefits and barriers on behaviors. Theoretical implications extending HBM for preventive behaviors in infection risk control are outlined and intervention recommendations for interventions are suggested."
2009-0659,Health Communication in 3D Virtual Environments,Channel Matters: Health Communication in Interpersonal and Technologically Mediated Contexts,,,,Paper,Health Communication in 3D Virtual Environments,Channel Matters: Health Communication in Interpersonal and Technologically Mediated Contexts,"This study calls for scholarly and public attention to the importance of health education about the prevention of HPV infection and health advertising about the availability of the HPV vaccine. I tested the effectiveness of avatar-based health intervention inside three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds of Second Life. Results of a within-subject comparison demonstrated significant improvement in the target audiences knowledge about HPV after the health intervention conducted by a medical doctor avatar (recommendation avatar). In addition, drawing upon regulatory focus theory and the conceptual framework of self-construal, this study examined the moderating effect of health consumers interdependent self-construal in the persuasion process in health communication. Results demonstrated that health consumers with a dominant interdependent view of self perceived health intervention with a prevention focus (vs. promotion focus) as more important."
2009-0660,Health Communication Syllabus Project: Graduate Instruction in Health Communication,Health Communication Education and Collaboration,,,,Paper,Health Communication Syllabus Project: Graduate Instruction in Health Communication,Health Communication Education and Collaboration,"As the demand for trained health communication professionals grows, and the number of graduate courses, concentrations, and degree programs in health communication continues to increase, it is important to assess the academic training received by future health communication professionals. The purpose of this paper is to gauge the content of graduate-level health communication courses, and understand if significant differences exist between health communication curricula in schools/departments of communication versus public health. A content analysis of 94 syllabi was conducted. The most commonly cited assigned readings included Making Health Communication Work, The Handbook of Health Communication, and the health communication chapter (Chapter 11) of Healthy People 2010. Issues related to mass communication are the most commonly covered area of communication across both types of schools/departments. Health campaigns and related subject matter are the only area covered by the vast majority (81.8%) of courses. Significant differences in subject matter by program type were primarily a reflection of public health schools/departments being more likely than communication schools/departments to cover applied areas of health communication such as program planning or crisis management. The results suggest that health communication training differs in schools/departments of communication versus health."
2009-0661,Health News Agenda-Building: Journalists Perceptions of the Role of Public Relations,Top Papers in Public Relations,,,,Paper,Health News Agenda-Building: Journalists Perceptions of the Role of Public Relations,Top Papers in Public Relations,"This study seeks to advance understanding of the agenda-building process. It uses a nationwide survey (N = 774) to examine how health journalists develop story ideas using public relations and non-public relations resources. It also explores how they rate and value expert source characteristics, and how they perceive the acceptability of using public relations materials in their stories. Results indicate that intermedia agenda-setting may be a stronger influence on agenda-building than are information subsidies. Data also show that journalists do rate characteristics associated with public relations traininggetting back to reporters quickly and quotabilityas important in expert sources. Also, journalists differ by their role orientations. Those who take the audience advocate role are more accepting of news releases than those who take a skeptic role. Future directions for agenda-building research are proposed."
2009-0662,Healthy Communication: Mere Communication Effect on Managing Chronic Health Problems,"Online Social Support, Information, and Health Communication",,,,Paper,Healthy Communication: Mere Communication Effect on Managing Chronic Health Problems,"Online Social Support, Information, and Health Communication","Effective management of chronic disease requires continuous health care and treatment to improve patients knowledge, skills, and confidence. In addition to professional health care and treatment, this study suggests that information and communication behavior among patients and their community will affect patients perceived affective and physical coping outcomes. While the majority of past research has focused on information seeking, this study pays attention to information giving behaviors. Computer-mediated communication, specifically blogs, has opened up new possibilities of information sharing among patients. Therefore, we propose two models to examine, first, the effects of communication behavior on coping outcomes among health problem solvers of chronic diseases, and second, the mediation processes. With a survey dataset of 201 chronic disease patients (e.g., cancer, HIV/AIDS, Lupus), we tested the proposed communication effects using structural equation modeling. Findings suggest that there are substantial and positive effects of information behaviors on coping strategies and outcomes in managing chronic diseases. Implications for patients and health care providers are discussed."

To address this apparent incongruity, an experiment was conducted in which participants were exposed to a mock news story about a violent crime committed by either a Black or White perpetrator who was a violent video game enthusiast. Participants then assessed the culpability of the perpetrator (the extent to which they were a bad person) and the culpability of violent video games (the extent to which games may have contributed to the crime). Results suggest the presence of negative racial stereotyping of Blacks at an automatic level, indicated by greater perceptions of media culpability for Whites than for Blacks, though this negative stereotyping was not inhibited at a more conscious level."
2009-0664,"Hegel, Habermas, and Community: The Public in the New Media Era",Keywords in Communication: Conceptualizing Publics in Public Relations,,,,Paper,"Hegel, Habermas, and Community: The Public in the New Media Era",Keywords in Communication: Conceptualizing Publics in Public Relations,"Recent developments of media technologies have raised age-old questions about the role of the public in community decision-making and whether mediated forms of communication can play a meaningful role in public dialog. The 20th century notion of public articulated by James Grunig and others in a situational theory of publics was grounded in the Chicago School of Philosophy, especially in the democratic notions of John Dewey and Herbert Blumer. However, the theory depends for its force upon deeper assumptions underlying the ideas of the Enlightenment itself. Those assumptions have been challenged by late 20th century thinkers and are under renewed attack by evidence that 21st century technologies have inverted our understanding of the role mediated communication plays in public decision making.

Such a broad critique from so many quarters seems to call for a fundamental reconceptualization or at least a reexamination of the notion of the public. It calls for a new understanding of the role of media in communities. It also suggests the need for a reexamination of the principles guiding our thinking about the approaches public relations professionals take in dealing with the ideal of the public.

This paper proposes to begin this reexamination by returning to a major philosopher responsible for one of the most influential critiques of the idea of the Enlightenment: G. F. W. Hegel. In his seminal work, The Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel meticulously lays out a detailed map of the journal of the mind in its quest to find its place in the material world. Hegel's landscape of the spirit offers a fascinating insight into the possibility for a new conceptualization of the public. It offers a new understanding of the forces that drive human thought and human choice. It offers the structure for a new way of thinking about how to communicate with individuals and groups in the era of interactive media, fragmentation, and social networking."

The Use of American Sign Language in Nickelodeon's Blue's Clues,Instructional and Entertainment Communication in the Home: Parental and Media Processes,"This content analysis examined Nickelodeons preschool television program Blues Clues for the use of American Sign Language (ASL). Two weeks of typical episodes were analyzed and compared to two special episodes highlighting ASL and featuring actress Marlee Matlin. The analysis revealed high usage of ASL in the special episodes (M=59.9 words/episode), but low usage in typical episodes (M = 8.75). ASL use in typical episodes was inconsistent both within and between episodes. 61.4% of signs were only used once per episode, and 57.9% of signs were used in more than one episode. Most signing was done by live-action characters (94.3%), and most signs represented abstract ideas (88.6%) rather than objects. The results are discussed in terms of possible implications for both hearing and hearing-impaired viewers in light of social learning/cognitive theory and the theory of attitude development."

It investigates socialization strategies in families that organize childrens involvement with media technologies, and the types of responses that children provide to such strategies. Specifically, it explores how children are socialized into thinking about prioritizing activities, when one of them involves media. Also, this study examines how availability or unavailability of time with media is morally constructed in face-to-face interactions, and what roles participants play in those constructions, paying special attention to processes of negotiation, authority, and power through directive trajectories.
Three trends of discourses around media emerge. First, when media use is framed as problematic, prioritizing certain activities for the sake of time seems to systematically entail postponing media use. Second, when the concept of media is ratified by parents, it becomes a threat or prize, even a privilege to be earned by children in order to be properly enjoyed. Third, even when children are rightfully engaged in media, parents often seem to be wary of their childrens ability to turn the technology off by themselves, and try to reinforce moral accountability."

In this study, we explore theoretical mechanisms related to information-processing differences caused by specialist and generalist media sources. When we have a chain of sources (websites and web agents) in online media, does specialization of one of them bias the processing of underlying information? Is specialization a cue that triggers the expertise heuristic and thereby promotes heuristic, rather than systematic, processing? If so, does it affect affective trust more than cognitive trust of media site and content? To address such questions, an experiment (N = 140) was conducted with an online shopping task. Participants showed greater trust in web site, web agent, and product descriptions when exposed to a specialist web agent than to a generalist web agent. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

The research employed a mixed fractional experimental design, using 97 adult participants recruited from the local community. Historical references in newspaper stories impacted the effectiveness of the stories, but their presence reduced credibility and newsworthiness perceptions for national stories. For local stories, the impact of historical references on these perceptions was attenuated. Overall, national stories without historical references were judged most credible and newsworthy. Story understanding was unaffected by the presence of historical references in both types of news stories."

However, in this paper, I provide a historical analysis of its application to domestic production competition, focusing on the earliest efforts made by the Hollywood film industry and the California state legislature to stem domestic runaway production to states such as North Carolina, Florida, and Texas in the 1970s and 80s. I contend that runaway production has historically served as a hegemonic discourse of economy and cultural authenticity for the Hollywood film industry, evolving to suit the political and economic conditions of the time, but always functioning to preserve Hollywoods status as a global media capital (Curtin, 2003), both abroad and at home."
2009-0670,Home is Where the Brand is: Childrens Television in a Postnetwork Era,The Consequences of Postnetwork Television Beyond Prime Time,,,,Paper,Home is Where the Brand is: Childrens Television in a Postnetwork Era,The Consequences of Postnetwork Television Beyond Prime Time,"In the current media environment, what it means to be a young television fan has shifted from a simple loyalty to particular programs to an investment in a multi-media brand atmosphere. Indeed, in the contemporary era of post-network television, new technologies, increased access to online activity in the form of user-generated content, and multi-media brand platforms that engage kids in websites and ancillary products, the social practice of watching television is even more complex. This paper illustrates some of these dynamics by focusing on youth brands such as Nickelodeon, Disney, Fox Kids, and Cartoon Network, which have all assiduously crafted their brand identity so that kids watching these networks affiliate more with the brand than with individual programming. Through examining specific youth programs, I argue that the shift from program loyalty to brand loyalty reflects another, broader cultural shift, in which children are understood not only as savvy consumers who make consumer choices but also as sophisticated practitioners of convergence culture."

Glocalization refers to the interface of the global and the local. After Hong Kong Disneylands lack of success within a year of its opening in 2005, Disney executives applied glocalization principles by attempting to cater to the local Chinese context. Four major glocalization changes were made: (1) reduction of prices; (2) adaptation to local visitors customs; (3) change of décors and settings; and (4) adaptation of labor practices. Ever since, Hong Kong Disneyland has proved successful: park attendance and revenues from growth have increased."

In order to reach as many patients and families as possible, hospice chaplains frequently find themselves in the position of proactively challenging stereotypes of religious professionals and engaging in careful self-presentation, particularly during early interactions with patients and their families. The current study involves interviews with 44 current and former hospice chaplains and journal entries kept by two hospice chaplains. The data from these interviews and journal entries reveal several strategies that chaplains use to handle the group stereotypes that hospice patients and their families often hold regarding religious professionals."

In particular, the research presented here represents an attempt to find an affective mechanism and consequences of a perceptual difference in evaluating media bias from the perspective of audiences, especially partisans. The study reveals that partisanship played a significant role in the perceptual difference of media bias in an important area of science communicationclimate change. News consumers anger perception was tested as a mediator in seeking an affective mechanism of hostile media perception. With regard to the social consequences, hostile media perception was a significant predictor of participants trust in the media, selective media use, and trust in newspaper coverage of global warming."

In addition to the message type of Blame or Attack, this study examines message components used to increase awareness (i.e., Message Sensation Value, MSV) and asks participants to evaluate arousal and hedonic valence of the message (i.e., positive, negative, or coactive), all of which have been shown to affect persuasiveness of the message. A 2 (Positivity Offset  low/high) X 2 (Negativity Bias  low/high) X 2 (Message Type  Attack/Blame) X 2 (MSV  low/high) x Message Replication (5) x Order repeated measures design was used. Findings suggest that High MSV Attack messages are superior to Low MSV and Blame messages in terms of persuasiveness and generating arousal and emotional responses capable of influencing information processing. In addition, intent not to smoke in the future was affected more by High MSV Attack messages. Overall findings suggest aversive activation may have a larger sway on attitudes and behaviors than appetitive activation."

Yet research on parody videos made by youth in the United States reveals that crafting what appears to be a bad video is often a way of negotiating and displaying ones technical and visual competencies. From certain perspectives these parody videos may look like the bad videos that are being parodied. This paper will analyze video parody and discuss the nuanced formalisms that may be used to show that a video maker is actually quite knowledgeable about the rules of good video making, and about certain technical subjects such as games. Formalisms examined include costuming, editing, and incorporation of gaming imagery. The paper explores how certain forms of parody are important in technically oriented cultures, and it argues that communicating technical competence through video is inherently relational, since its success depends upon distancing the self from the video displays of less technically-savvy video makers and prior video making selves as children. The paper will challenge the implicit assumption that it is possible to assess video makers abilities by evaluating a single video using obvious semiotic markers of video expertise. It will also show how a parody video may function as a visually interpellative move that calls forth viewers within an imagined community of interest whose participants share similar nostalgic interests in gaming and advanced-amateur video making."

Examining Relationships Between Technological Affordances & Sociocognitive Determinates on Affective and Behavioral Outcomes.,Game Studies Top Papers,,,,Paper,How Can Wii Learn From Video Games? Examining Relationships Between Technological Affordances & Sociocognitive Determinates on Affective and Behavioral Outcomes.,Game Studies Top Papers,"When the Nintendo Wii was released to the public in November 2006, video game play was changed. The unique motion sensing technology allowed game players to interact with the game environment using kinesthetic body motions that replicated real-world activities. When combined with the ability to customize game avatars, the Nintendo Wii has the potential to be a powerful learning tool. Social Cognitive Theory provides a theoretical model for how these technological affordances may contribute to learning through modeled behavior.
A 2x2 fully crossed, between-subjects experiment plus control group was designed to empirically test how the type of controller (motion controller vs. symbolic controller) and avatar customization (customized vs. uncustomized) contribute to cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses when playing the Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 video game.
A revised path model indicates that using the motion controller leads to better video game performance, in addition to better performance in a real-world putting task. Further, use of the motion controller leads to greater perceptions of golf-efficacy (as mediated by presence), and is positively correlated with liking of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 video game, which in turn leads to greater perceptions of liking of the game of golf. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

This study explored these dynamics within immigrant families, with particular focus on the leadership roles children of immigrants play as translators of media, language, and culture to help their parents locate resources in their new communities. Utilizing Livingstones domestic infrastructure (2002) concept, interviews with 43 parents and children in a new immigrant Latino community in Los Angeles revealed the key ways that children and their parents connect with and understand information about community resources and services. Understanding how childrens media connections link their families to community information resources that facilitate settlement and adaptation also has application in other urban centers as population diversity continues to increase worldwide."

We requested three lighting designers to take guidance from the websites to produce their own lighting design concepts. These design proposals formed the departure point for interviews and designers self-reflection, and revealed the designers experience of the websites based on the information and inspiration found, or wished for. The study was informed in part by Dervins Sense-Making Methodology."

Data came from large project on online interactive health system for low-income patients. This research analyzed baseline and four-month follow-up surveys assessing participants (N = 231) background characteristics and health outcomes, as well as disclosive messages they posted in the bulletin-board-type online groups during the four-month period. Data supported the positive associations between disclosure in online groups and health benefits at follow-up, mainly in a subset of active posters who wrote two or more disclosive messages. Specifically, insightful disclosure led to greater improvements in health self-efficacy, emotional well-being, and functional well-being, mediated by lowered breast cancer concerns. Negative emotional disclosure weakened the negative relations between concerns and functional well-being. The findings were discussed with regard to theoretical models explaining the mechanisms underlying the benefits of written disclosure."
2009-0680,How Does It Feel? Mediation and Imagination,Mediation and Emotion,,,,Paper,How Does It Feel? Mediation and Imagination,Mediation and Emotion,"Many analyses of the relationship between media and emotion are underpinned by an implicit theory of stimulus and response, as well as by a mimetic paradigm: media representations are thought to arouse viewers largely by activating or simulating a repertoire of pre-existing emotional reactions. While such a model may be appropriate to isolable cases of strong emotional responses to media, it suffers from two principal problems: it tells us little about the low-intensity, ambient emotional moods (such as boredom, indifference, contentment) experienced by individuals in everyday media-saturated environments, and it assumes that media-related emotional states are similar in kind to emotions that are elicited independently of media (with the later usually enjoying priority over the former). This paper attempts to address these problems - complicating the stimulus-response model and the mimetic conception of emotional response - by reanimating the concept of imagination in relation to media. Taking television as an example, it contends that mediation is both an effect of and a platform for productive, dynamic imaginative activity. This activity necessarily possesses important affective dimensions, extending viewers emotional repertoires and enabling the creation of new emotional registers and modes of exploration."

In doing so, portal users responses are presented in two different forms: individual postings and numeric approval ratings associated with each posting. In addition, the current study investigates how participants need for cognition (NFC: preference for and enjoyment of analytical thinking) might moderate the extent to which they utilize these cues with differing diagnostic values to infer the general opinion climate, as well as the influence of news media. It is predicted that those exposed to other readers reactions will modify their beliefs about public opinion and their estimates of media influence on public opinion accordingly. Also, we expect that high NFC individuals will rely more on overall approval ratings than individual postings in inferring public opinion and assessing media influence, whereas low NFC individuals will place greater weight on individual comments than summary statistics. Implications for the influence of presumed media influence model (Gunther & Storey, 2003) will be discussed."

An Examination of Interpersonal Communication Processes Between Medical Students and Patients With Disabilities,Healthcare Provider and Patient Communication,,,,Paper,How Do I Ask About Your Disability? An Examination of Interpersonal Communication Processes Between Medical Students and Patients With Disabilities,Healthcare Provider and Patient Communication,"This study examines interpersonal communication processes in the ways family medicine clerkship students ask standardized patient educators about visually apparent disability in videotaped interactions (N=142). Primary and secondary themes of asking about or avoiding disability were identified with regard to language, timing in asking, and whether they integrated disability with pain complaints. Seventy-four percent of the students asked about disability. Analysis of feedback immediately following the interactions revealed that more than half of the students who did not ask about disability spontaneously recognized they avoided disability language. Underlying attitudes, possibilities for integrating biomedical concerns with social-psychological impacts of disability, and reflections on learning are addressed. Implications for disability as relationship-centered healthcare and communication theory-building are included."

An Observation and a Survey on the Research Performed by Journalists Working for Daily Newspapers, Radio, Television, and Online",Journalism Studies Poster Session,"This paper reports how journalists integrate online research procedures into their overall research process and how they assess the Internet and search engines. The most extensive oberservation of journalists worldwide (n = 235) and a written survey of 601 journalists from newspapers, radio, television and online media provide the data base. The observation revealed that research actions account for half of the working time. Cross-checking research hardly takes place at all. Journalists use computer-aided research tools more frequently but not for as long as classic, non-computer-aided research tools. Search engines, in particular Google, dominate the source determination process and thereby have a decisive influence on the entire course of journalists research. The survey showed that a high level of journalistic attention focused on only a few Internet offerings. The surveyed journalists exhibit a pragmatic attitude towards the Internet and search engines as a research tool, even though they are aware of possible problems. Overall, the study shows that computer-aided research supplements but does not replace classic research. Instead, the Internet gains in significance for those tasks which it helps to fulfill more efficiently and opens up new possibilities. However, the increased self-referentiality in journalism and the Google-ization of research represent a cause for concern."

An Examination of a Temporary Parasocial Breakup,Reactions to Bad Things Happening,,,,Paper,How Do We React When Our Favorite Shows and Favorite Characters Are Taken Away? An Examination of a Temporary Parasocial Breakup,Reactions to Bad Things Happening,"This study examines viewers reactions to a parasocial breakup situation. The television writers strike in 2007 caused many popular television shows to be taken off the air for a limited but substantial amount of time. Individuals who had their favorite TV character and/or favorite TV show taken off the air because of the strike were asked about their parasocial relationships (PSRs) with their favorite characters, their general TV affinity and about the distress that was caused by the loss of their favorite character/TV show. Results show that those with stronger PSRs with their favorite television characters report greater distress when that character is no longer available for viewing and that those with greater television affinity report more distress when their favorite TV show is no longer available. Instrumental viewing was also found to predict greater distress while ritualistic viewing was not a significant predictor of distress."

The paper reviews the aspects of narrative theory that promote an understanding of what narrative theoretical concerns can contribute to such an understanding of the form, function, and rhetoric of these mass-mediated narratives, and promotes both historical and qualitative research with the genre to help understand this genres participatory aspects. The author sees a significant function of mystery narratives to be an engagement of the audience in narrative-creation process; this participatory function provides an intriguing power balance between author and audience and aids in its audience members appropriating this strategy within their everyday lives. As such, this paper stresses the need for communication scholars to study the creation, reception, and content of popular cross-medial genres such as mystery in both its old and new medial forms to better understand how narrative, genre, and media intersect to communicate common metaphors that are applied in various ways by authors and audience members alike, both in the way they approach or create new creative iterations of the genre and in they approach certain kinds of challenges in their everyday lives."

Applying the Hallin/Mancini Framework Outside the Western World,Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World,"With their book Comparing Media Systems Hallin and Mancini have filled an important gap in communications studies by providing a long-awaited conceptual framework that allows for a systematic classification of media systems. However, as the authors emphasize the framework of their study is confined to established democracies of the western world. This paper sets out to explore whether and to what extent the models specified by Hallin & Mancini can be applied to countries outside the scope of their analysis. Taking the constituent dimensions of the models as a starting point, the paper argues that even though global media markets and new communications technologies push for convergence across national and cultural boundaries local practices and country-specific constraints have brought about media systems that cannot be sufficiently captured by the existing models. This will be demonstrated by the problems arising when exporting public service broadcasting, different logics of parallelism and culture-specific norms of journalistic professionalism. The paper concludes by suggesting an expansion of the initial framework that incorporates categories that help to understand media systems outside established western democracies."
2009-0687,How Gender Affects Reading News: Androgyny as a Moderator of Cognitive Resources and Comprehension,Keywords in Information Systems: Attention (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,How Gender Affects Reading News: Androgyny as a Moderator of Cognitive Resources and Comprehension,Keywords in Information Systems: Attention (High Density),"This study explored how the structure of written news affects androgynous and gender-typed individuals differently in terms of cognition. Four different news stories were manipulated so that there was an inverted pyramid and chronological version of each. In a 2 (structure) x 2 (story) x (repetition) mixed design, 58 participants read four stories, each on a different topic. Dependent measures included availability of cognitive resources, cued recall, recognition and comprehension. Gender as a psychological trait was measured via the Bem Sex Role Inventory (Bem, 1974). Using a median split procedure, participants were identified as belonging to one of four categories: masculine; feminine; undifferentiated (low in both gender traits); and androgynous (high in both gender traits). There was a significant interaction between gender and story structure, such that androgynous individuals had the slowest reaction times, overall. By contrast, undifferentiated participants had the fastest reaction times and appeared most affected by story structure differences. The results are discussed in the context of a comprehensibility interpretation of the STRT measure (Britton et al., 1978; Britton et al. 1983). The findings suggest that androgynous individuals, identified in the psychological literature as more stable and achieving than people in other gender categories, spent more time constructing meaning during reading than subjects in other categories."

Motivational Activation and Use Influence Reactivity to Pictures of Risky Products,Keywords in Information Systems: Motivation (High Density),,,,Paper,How Good Is That Beer in the Window? Motivational Activation and Use Influence Reactivity to Pictures of Risky Products,Keywords in Information Systems: Motivation (High Density),"The study reported here examines how peoples affective responses to risky visual content (e.g. pictures of alcohol, beer, cigarettes and smoking paraphernalia, and condoms) compared to non-risky pictures (e.g soda pop, orange juice, pretzels) vary as a function of substance use and motivational activation. Limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) is used to guide predictions. Motivational activation measure (MAM) is used to identify participants by motivation type groups: risk takers, risk avoiders, inactives, and coactives.
Each participant viewed the 30 pictures of risky and non-risky products and rated each picture in terms of how arousing, how negative, and how positive it made them feel. The EMG data on orbicularis oculi and corrugator supercilli muscle groups were collected. Overall results suggest that both motivational type and use significantly modulate reactivity to risky pictures. As expected  heavy users were more coactive in their response to risky cues than light users. The light users responded positively to images of risky pictures. Risk takers initially showed no variability between light and heavy users, but overtime heavy users produced both more OO and more corrugator activation. Interestingly, the heavy user risk avoider group felt more positive overtime. The reactions of inactives and coactives were primarily driven by use."

A total of 567 first, second and third-generation French-Muslims were surveyed to ascertain the Muslim communitys perception of French language policies. Aside from revealing a decreased motivation to acculturate and increased resentment toward the dominant culture, the studys results demonstrate the importance of ethnolinguistic vitality in understanding the communitys overall refusal to completely adapt to the dominant French culture."

Abstract
When I began studying the emotional effects of the mass media in the late 1960s with Dolf Zillmann, using his theory of excitation transfer (Zillmann, 1972), we assessed such peripheral indices of emotion as heart rate and blood pressure, but the role of the brain in emotions was beyond our ability to measure. Since then, there have been huge developments in neurophysiological measurement through the availability of fMRI, among other procedures. LeDouxs (1996) two-component conceptualization of traumatic memories has helped illuminate why seemingly irrational long-term effects of scary movies are so prominent (Cantor, 2006). The discovery of mirror neurons (see Iacoboni & Dapretto, 2006) will no doubt also be helpful in understanding both empathetic and imitative processes in response to media. I wholeheartedly agree with Rene Weber and associates (2008) call to incorporate neurophysiological approaches into the study of communication."
2009-0691,How Persuasive Are Ads? Cognitive Dissonance and Political Advertisements,Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,How Persuasive Are Ads? Cognitive Dissonance and Political Advertisements,Political Communication Poster Session,"This paper examines persuasion in a political campaign environment by looking at exposure to a dissonant message about political identity and exposure to political advertisements. Respondents in an online experiment were randomly assigned to an implicit attitude test message that is consonant or dissonant with their expressed party affiliation, then viewed political advertisements that were consonant or dissonant with their party identification. The results demonstrate that short exposure to political advertising alone can create substantial persuasion, but when combined with party preference dissonance, respondents found dissonant party advertisements less persuasive and showed less favorable ratings of that opposing candidate. This suggests that when an attack on political identity is combined with exposure to the opposing partys advertisements, it creates greater resistance to its persuasive message."
2009-0692,"How Small is Very Small? Assessing Pluralism, Diversity, and Media Democratic Performance in a Small Country",Twenty Years of Free Media and the Public Sphere in Central Europe,,,,Paper,"How Small is Very Small? Assessing Pluralism, Diversity, and Media Democratic Performance in a Small Country",Twenty Years of Free Media and the Public Sphere in Central Europe,"This presentation is structured around the normative ideal that the function of news media is to support democratization, ensure that different opinions and voices are heard, and guarantee the freedom of speech. As contemporary practices reveal, media has many goals to aim at; however, very often, medias actual informational contribution does not meet the normative demands.
The article takes a small country perspective and examines how media pluralism and diversity debate is challenged by such an approach. It looks into media structures of the three Baltic countries and assesses the relationship between the size of news market and proclaimed policies as well as media performance there.
As will be demonstrated, very liberal regulation, ongoing structural changes (concentration of ownership, technological convergence, management of audience relations) in news market and weak tradition of professional journalism result in proliferation of market-oriented logic. In contemporary media, the process of journalism homogenization (or journalistic genre mixing, i.e. blurring boundaries between news, promotional writing and advertising), shifting quality of news, arrival of more sensational and more entertainment oriented reporting becomes a common practice.
As appears, this  so-called media marketization  process is nothing new. A common understanding in contemporary media studies is that convergence of media systems and homogenisation of journalism is becoming a worldwide trend. In small markets, however, the process of media marketization creates a dual impression. On the one hand, market-led model promoted in media regulation and existing policies in the three Baltic countries, also the emerging new possibilities and forms for funding of media products, result in media structural as well as content diversity. On the other hand, in such context, new skills are needed by the audience to be able to critically assess available information, make informed choices and become interpreters of what is credible and valuable  in general terms, to be media literate."

Specifically, students were asked to construct life-lines of people who have influenced their lives and helped them to understand the nature of societies and what makes societies better or worse. Several multi-faceted discourses emerged from these studies, and in classroom discussion of them, which this paper will identify. It will focus on how this experience did or did not lead students to new self-understandings, and how dominant social ideologies were resisted or reproduced."

In particular, it analyzes how countries use online means of communication to build and manage relationships with foreign publics and how influential a country's online initiatives are on foreign publics' perceptions of the country.
In examining these issues, this study analyzes Café USA, the online community run by the U.S. Embassy in the South Korean capital, Seoul, to reach out to that countys citizens. Café USA is part of the Embassys efforts to interact with the younger generation in South Korea, which is the worlds most wired country and which has a substantial population that is regarded to hold anti-U.S. sentiments. The online community initiative represents an important example of networked public diplomacy, as it enables two-way communication between U.S. Embassy officials and South Korean citizens through the Internet.
This study conducts in-depth interviews with U.S. diplomatic officials who have been involved in networked public diplomacy in South Korea. The study also conducts a survey of South Koreans who are registered online members of Café USA. So far, the author has conducted five in-depth interviews with U.S. diplomatic officials and a total of 51 South Korean members of Café USA participated in the survey."

Drawing examples from my own scholarship on victims rights activism, feminist activism, and the cultures of media training, this talk examines what feminist inquiry can offer to the constitution and analysis of the materialities of communication; in my case, these economies of materiality include the social infrastructures and textual artifacts that enable movements to deploy their conceptual grammars in the spheres of policy and media representation. Cross-disciplinary modes of feminist inquiry in anthropology, philosophy and post-colonial studies provide new ways of thinking about ---and doing---analysis of communication infrastructures that prioritizes the cultural work they do and an understanding of the conditions that enable their social constitution (and not only their technological dimensions). This includes a body of methodological innovations for studying documentary materials, their construction as cultural artifacts and the circuits of distribution, enabling feminist researchers to pay attention to the movements of communication in building and transforming institutions as a key practice of feminist methodology."

These students expressed that sometimes they had difficulty with the composition of the article, although they did not always say so in those words. Many students also mentioned that they believed that many of their counterparts experienced difficulty comprehending the article. Further exploration is warranted to learn how early college students begin to make sense of journal articles, written within particular discourse communities. These findings have relevance to assumptions made by educators about college students using these journal articles in their reading and writing assignments."

Lifes picture packages rely on certain familiar stereotypes or myths in American culture in order to justify U.S. involvement and its results in the Korean War. Two primary mythical themes are: Humanitarianism/Paternalism and Moral triumph against Communism. Using a photo story of a Korean orphan, the war was defined as a just war to save helpless South Korea from the aggression of evil Communism. The war was also depicted as a moral victory in a photo story of a regretful ex-guerilla who returned home thanks to the South Korean governments generosity.
Thus, Lifes photographs, relying as they do on mythical narratives and avoiding divergent subject matter, could steer readers toward a constructed reality of the war, while preventing readers from a more complete understanding."

The humiliation takes on many forms: It includes personal insults and harsh criticisms by judges, exposing the agony of defeat, the public airings of people's troubles and defects, making people survive by eating otherwise inedible foods, etc. The present study questions the underlying assumption held by the producers of reality shows that humiliation serves to enhance audience enjoyment. The study was designed to experimentally test the association between perceived humiliation in reality shows and the enjoyment from them. The design included a between-subject factor manipulating the type of humiliation (insult and degradation), a within subject factor manipulating the level of humiliation of the scenes (presented in either an escalating or decreasing order), and the measurement of enjoyment of the various scenes as a dependent variable. The findings were contrary to the theoretical expectations and the common assumptions: As humiliation increases enjoyment decreases. Furthermore, as humiliation increases displeasure increases. From a closer look at the data it seems that this relationship is not linear and it is only the intense humiliation that harms enjoyment."

Mediating Islam From the Halal Website to the Islamic Talk Show,Popular Communication beyond the Nation: from the Global to the Local,"Islam is going through a fundamental diffusion of religious knowledge and authority. Media technologies like the Web and satellite television are facilitating the emergence of a new breadth of Islam in the public sphere in Muslim societies and amongst Muslims in diaspora. Deeply influenced by the global and local dynamics of consumer culture, the proponents of this new Islam are more media-savvy and less dogmatic on how Islam should be mediated than their conservative counterparts. Unlike in the politically engaged Islam, the architects of this new trend are younger Muslims with more business skills than religious knowledge. From websites advertising the latest fashions in Islamic dress and others offering halal versions to non-Islamic foods such as the Italian Salami, the German Sausage or McDonalds burger to television shows encouraging Muslims to use their religion as a success formula for spiritual self-fulfillment and material achievement, the new economic liberalism of Islam is certainly modern in its mediation, but is its substance as liberal as the form?
This paper examines how the new religious media are constructing the image of the modern Muslim and what kind of religious identities and subjectivities emerge as a result of a purely material consumption that is religiously committed. My analysis is based on a textual analysis of a popular Islamic television show on Iqra, a 24-hour Saudi religious channel that prides itself in being the first Islamic entertainment television."

However, inducing feelings of hypocrisy can also result in boomerang effects, leading to a decreased likelihood of engaging the desired behavior. In the context of recycling, this study extends existing literature by ascertaining whether hypocrisy can be induced in an online survey rather than face-to-face, potentially making the method a useful mass-mediated social influence tool. Along the way, we examine excuse-making as a dissonance reducing mediator of the effects of feelings of hypocrisy as well as the potential of an efficacy enhancing message to increase the probability of achieving a desired behavioral outcome following a hypocrisy induction. Although we found no evidence that making people feel hypocritical influenced their behavioral intentions directly, our results suggest that people who are feeling hypocritical and who are feeling less efficacious are more likely to make excuses for their failure to act consistent with their attitudes, which then indirectly reduces intentions to engage in attitudinal-consistent behavior. This boomerang effect can be eliminated by combining a hypocrisy induction with an efficacy enhancing message."

Specially, it investigates the influence of two key components: interpersonal behavior and intergroup membership, on members evaluations of computer-mediated groups. Participants (N = 256) in 64 four-person groups interacted through synchronous computer chat. Sub-group assignments to minimal groups instilled significantly greater in-group vs. out-group identification. One member in each group was instructed to exhibit interpersonally likable or dislikable behavior. Analysis revealed that the black sheep effect failed to hold true in the actual group interactions. Confederates acting likably were more attractive than those acting dislikably regardless of their in-group or out-group status. Interpersonal behavior generally provided stronger effects on members evaluation in virtual groups than did intergroup dynamics."

This talk introduces a typology for classifying image and sound bites, those newsmaker depictions that may include audio only, audio and video, or video only, in the context of presidential election coverage. Crossing presentation modality (sound, image) with exemplar bite categories (gaffe, iconic moment) produces a 2x2 table that captures much of what media audiences see of candidates and other newsmakers, whether on television or via networked communication technologies. In the audiovisual environment of television, iconic image bites effectively function as key visuals. The presentation also distinguishes between social and factual forms of information and reviews why image bites are underappreciated in research for their persuasive value."

While the s-shaped curve is the dominant form most scholars assume for virtually any kind of diffusion, there are reasons to expect that in highly ICT-rich environments different shaped diffusion curves occur. This study expects convex r-curves because of: 1) heavy ICT use in dissemination, 2) visibility of the number of adopters and their status, 3) the innovation is ambiguous, 4) herd effects, 5) information cascades, and 6) reduced interpersonal communication and 7) in some cases mandated adoption. Six interconnected innovations in an automobile engineering environment of several thousand users are studied as they diffuse over time through email. Results show evidence supporting the hypothesized convex r-curves. Additional hypotheses are that who-to-whom email networks and semantic networks across email texts will show increasing structure (negentropy) over time. Evidence appears to support these hypotheses. A research question examined is whether there is a relationship between sentiment in email content over time and who-to-whom network change. After a drop in recommended ratios of positive to negative sentiment in email content a unit was terminated by management, unaware of the observed sentiment pattern. A method was developed to add a third dimension -- hierarchical level -- to typically two-dimensional network displays to enable observation of multi-level network connections affected by people who leave."

Social capital has been shown to affect this migration pattern (Tolbert, Irwin, Nucci, & Lyson, 2002). This paper details a web-based intervention aimed at increasing the social capital of rural youth. Researchers linked high-school aged students with rural community business and volunteer leaders through an online class to teach skills and provide the project with the necessary opportunity to build a web-based community information resource. Results show that the experience had a significant impact on the participant's social capital, increasing local career plans and volunteer and social networking efficacy. ICT literacy also significantly increased. This study provides evidence that the creation of web-based community information resources can lead to increased social capital in rural communities. Results of this study are valuable for researchers developing ICT solutions to address the flight of rural youth and the plight of rural communities."

They must deal with the identity labels used by others (paraplegics, arthritics) with which they may or may not identify. Furthermore, they predominantly use language, including labels, stereotypes, and subtle questions and imperatives, to negotiate the blurred boundaries they inhabit (I am not my arthritis, society must give equal access to differently abled people). Models of acculturation (e.g., Berrys taxonomy) can easily be adapted to describe this process and predict individual differences in identity, language, and ultimately response to the illness or disability."

In the present study, we examined whether such social identity contingencies would operate in virtual worlds, into which avatars are increasingly bringing virtual faces and bodies that embody race and ethnicity. Given that popular virtual worlds such as Second Life are often criticized for its ""White-bias"" or prevalence of White avatars, it is likely that racial minorities, when exposed to cues that signal ""White-dominance,"" may sense the environment to be potentially threatening to their racial identities. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment (N=60) in which Caucasian and non-Caucasian participants read profiles of avatars (showcased as Second Life Residents), which were designed to manipulate absence versus presence of diversity cues as conveyed via visual and numerical representation of race. Findings demonstrated that among non-Caucasian participants, those who read racially-diverse avatar profiles (diversity-cue-present), when compared with those who read Caucasian-only avatar profiles (diversity-cue-absent), expressed significantly higher levels of (1) sense of belonging to the virtual world, (2) intention to participate in the virtual world, and (3) willingness to reveal their racial identity through avatars."

In particular we studied the case of Fotolog, a popular photoblog application in Chile. The results presented here are based on data from 32 in-depth interviews administered to 14-19 year olds in Santiago, Chile. Our results suggest that, at least for some adolescents, photoblogs are an important constituent of their daily media consumption which help them to fulfil several of the developmental needs typical of their age. In particular, we found out that adolescents employ Fotolog as a mechanism to receive social validation, to gain social control, to achieve self-clarification, and to maintain social relationships, four of the most important functions of self-disclosure during adolescence."

Unfortunately, by perpetuating the myth of the stranger rapist and failing to create prevention programs that target men, universities have not adequately responded to campus rapes. Despite the call to create prevention programs that account for male audience members, there are few studies that specifically highlight the ways in which college men respond to sexual assault education. This study fills that void by highlighting the voices of college male students. Using open-ended questions and thematic analysis, the authors noted how the respondents in this study confirmed and contradicted earlier findings. After discussing the systematic nature of patriarchy on college campuses, the perspectives of male students are presented and analyzed. The authors conclude the essay by noting the heuristic value of this study and offering future directions for prevention educators and researchers. The findings of this study should be interesting for communication and gender studies teacher-scholars."

The medical diagnosis of TV inpatients is biased towards dramatic diseases like mood disorders and medical problems that are abundant with gore such as injuries. The mortality rate among TV inpatients is nearly nine times higher than that of inpatients in the real world. The results are discussed from the perspectives of media system dependency theory and cultivation theory."

This paper discusses these utterances in a specific institutional setting  political radio phone-in programs in Israel. The participants use these phrases in similar ways to earlier description. Yet, the I have a question also have institutional functions. Hosts use these utterances to manage the interaction and to get the exclusive floor during overlaps. This use is part of their institutional role, and constructs their identity as hosts. Callers use them at the beginning of their talk, usually as a story-prompt. However, when callers use the utterance, hosts can challenge them for reversing the institutional roles. Regular callers can use the request for question similarly to the hosts. The pre-questions in the Israeli radio phone-in programs are therefore an interactional practice to manage an interaction in an institutional setting."

The visual rhetoric of war transformed dramatically during the Vietnam war, and this essay attempts to assess the impact of photojournalism in spurring this transformation. Cara Finnegans notion of the image vernacular of a given historical period is employed in order to identify the different ways that wars were pictured from World War II to Vietnam, identifying the rise of a critical use of photographs to spur opposition to government war propaganda. In defense of this claim, the essay interprets important photo-essays as they reflected and influenced public understanding, and argues that the inventional resources of the photographer as visual narrator provoked popular reflection on the traumatic dimension of war. By challenging previous visual narratives of war and by offering ambivalent images of life on the ground, the photo-essays of Larry Burrows engaged in a visual rhetoric that encouraged identification with suffering Vietnamese civilians, challenged heteronormative modes of framing heroic sacrifice, and contributed a climate in which popular opinion shifted against the war."

Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,,,,Paper,Illuminating Blind Spots in Visual Perception: Combining Gestalt Principles and Eyetracking Patterns to Explain Perception of Online and Printed Media,What You See is What You Get? Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,"This paper discusses to what extent the classical approach of Gestalt principles can be applied to explain measurements of visual perception with eye-tracking. Gestalt principles can be seen as a model to interpret certain effects and results of visual perception, whereas eyetracking does give empirical access to physically measurable effects during visual perception. The empirical basis are two studies done with journalistic media: One study compared reading of newspapers in broadsheet and compact format, the second used multimodal presentations in online journalism as stimuli. Applying Gestalt principles as a frame for interpreting eyetracking data allows to address central questions about the reception of multimodal presentations which combine visuals like photos and graphics with written text: How do recipients build references between components of a multimodal stimulus? Which elements are referred to other elements and in which form? Does that influence the further processes of reception?

2009-0715,Image of the United States in Arab Blogsphere,The Internet and Politics,,,,Paper,Image of the United States in Arab Blogsphere,The Internet and Politics,"Arab media, especially Arab independent new satellite channels, started extending their communication space from the real to the virtual world to explore realms which lie beyond existing social, political and physical constrains to edify citizens away from government local media breaking all traditional taboos, exposing the hypocrisy of Arab political systems. As a result, new forms of citizen journalism emerged where audience became news producers in a sense that they started interpreting news provided over the Internet and start shaping/ reshaping them according to their ideologies and repost them.

It is not difficult to argue that new media in the Arab world started to operate on different terms than the state controlled media especially on sensitive and taboo issues like Islam and the West, Peace process, Pan Arabism, Nationalism, and the United States. The later, of course according to Alterman , a topic is considered sensitive topic to discuss since officially most Arab countries are close allies to the US, some countries are US partners in its alleged war on terrorism in the region. In that sense, government media cannot be considered a proper tool to measure Arab World attitude towards the US, however with the proliferation new media proliferation, one can test the image of the United States in Arab new media especially Arab blogs, news comments, and messageboard which are considered a free open forum for discussion."

These instances of violence brought to life memories of colonialism and of the Algerian War. The emeutes, seen as moments of vulnerability for the immigrant populations in France, reframed the relation between the Algerian Diasporas in France and the nation of emigration, Algeria.
Considering the unequal historical relation between France and Algeria can the post-colonial Algeria and its public spheres protect the Algerians residing outside the national borders? What is the role of the national media in advancing the interests of different diasporic groups at times of intense discrimination abroad?
One way to answer these questions is to look at discourses constructed by the mass media of the country of emigration at moments when the diasporic communities are in danger and to account for the role of these discourses in weakening or strengthening the ties between the diasporas and the national community. This paper looks particularly at the Algerian case, analyzing the narratives constructed by the French media during the 2005 emeutes and the responses formulated by Algerian newspapers, engaged in a dialogic relation with the French media. By exploring the discourses in the French and Algerian press on the causes, actors, and development of the emeutes, I hope to shed some light on the ways in which Algerian public sphere protects the rights of the Algerians in France."

Understanding how to support useful and necessary interactions while simultaneously allowing people to avoid unwanted interruptions and distractions is therefore a critical research challenge. This paper reports on a qualitative study of former instant messaging (IM) users that explores two questions: 1) are younger users more adept at multi-tasking and therefore less vulnerable to distraction than their older counterparts, and 2) was distraction a reason that former IM users quit and, if so, what problems led to these distractions? Results suggest that, in the long term, IM ultimately leaves people too vulnerable to interruptions and distractions from too many people, and users feel they have little control in avoiding these."

Issues of import to minority communities can have distinct shades of meaning from their significance to the dominant population. One such issue is immigration, a topic raging in this election season. Divisions within ethnic communities can further complicate coverage. How do networks that cater to these communities present controversial issues, and how do these representations articulate the nexus between power relations within emigre communities as well as with the majority populations? This work will explore the significance of immigrant issues stories aired in Telemundo and Univision national newscasts from April 2008 to July, 2008. The research will be based on a content analysis of the main US Spanish speaking channels with special emphasis in identifying any bias or lack of perspectives in these stories. The results will provide a window into coverage of an important topic during an election year."

Based on Orlikowski et al.s (1995) technology-use mediation activities, and Leonard-Bartons (1988) model, this multiple case study examined perceived implementation characteristics of integrated newsrooms and their relations to implementation strategies, mediation activities, processes, and innovation responses. It interviewed 96 managers and news workers as well as overtly observed 44 days in early adopters of digital TV newsrooms (FTV, EBC, TVBS, DA-AI) in Taiwan. Its findings showed that the implementation characteristics of integrated newsrooms (low transferability, high organizational complexity, high divisibility) set parameters for implementation strategies (sponsors/champions, user involvement, mutual adaptation of organization and technology, top management support, gradual implementation). To reduce negative innovation responses and smooth out digital transition, various mediation activities, especially training/evaluation, were found to be deployed intensively in overlapped establishment and reinforcement stages."

A Look at Uncharted Processes in Media Effects Research,,,,Paper,Implicit Associations Test: Just What is the IAT Measuring?,Above and Beyond? A Look at Uncharted Processes in Media Effects Research,"The study of attitudes has long relied on explicit measures of attitudes such as likert and semantic differential scales. Reliance on these measures has hindered our understanding of how attitudes influence message processing and message effects. More recent interest in implicit measures of attitudes has been spurred by the interesting in implicit social cognition research that emerged in the mid-1990s in social psychology. The implicit associations test (IAT) has emerged as the dominant measure of implicit attitudes. However, there are ambiguities as to exactly what the IAT is measuring. This paper will focus on recent research in my lab illustrating what the IAT measures and provides practical solutions for improving the quality of the data obtained using the IAT."

This paper uses discourse analysis to examine how twenty-five parents appearing on a reality television program about improving child wellbeing, ""Honey Were Killing the Kids,"" respond to an extreme threat to their face (Goffman, 1967): The programs nutrition expert presents parents with computer-generated projections, or visual hypothetical narratives, that show their children physically developing into obese, unhealthy adults; further she blames the parents. Parents engage in impression management (Goffman, 1959) through accounting; specifically they create excuses and apologies by using response cries (Goffman, 1981), non-conclusive verbs, verbal avowals of emotion (Buttny, 1993), and emotional displays (e.g., crying). This study contributes to our understanding of parental impression management (especially on reality TV), of narrative responses as a locus of identity work, and of the role of affect in accounting practices."
2009-0723,Improving Brand Attitudes and Choice Through Congruence in Communication Modalities:The Moderating Role of Processing Style,Keywords in Information Systems: Attention (High Density),,,,Paper,Improving Brand Attitudes and Choice Through Congruence in Communication Modalities:The Moderating Role of Processing Style,Keywords in Information Systems: Attention (High Density),"Previous research has shown that prior brand exposure (e.g., through advertising) can positively influence brand consideration, brand attitudes, and brand choice. In the present studies, the authors argue that the effects of prior brand exposure depend on the communication modality (visual vs. aural) in which exposure (i.e., advertising) takes place, and the modality in which evaluations and choices are made. In a series of four studies it was hypothesized and found that congruence in communication modalities has a positive effect on brand evaluation and brand choice, compared to incongruence in modalities. Perceptual fluency is proposed to be the underlying mechanism explaining these effects. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the effects of modality congruence are moderated by individuals processing style in such a way that the impact is stronger under conditions of data-driven, as opposed to conceptually-driven, processing. These results indicate that recipients responses depend on the interaction between the modality in which recipients are exposed to the brand in advertising and the modality in which recipients encounter the brand in a purchase situation."

This movement could be seen in actions ranging from prison riots to best-selling books by prisoners, armed actions aiming to dramatize the plight of prisoners to chart-topping record albums about the perils of incarceration. The black prisoner was at the center of this mobilization, the image of injustice and the symbolic figurehead of resistance. In this paper, I argue that such political and cultural mobilizations made the prison visible as a site of racist repression. Through articulating prison as an extension of slavery, such visibility produced a coalition of prisoners and their allies that was multiracial yet revolved around the black prisoner. Using the example of George Jackson, a prisoner well known as both an author and a revolutionary, I argue that the highly politicized cultural resonance of oppressed black manhood made the prison a salient site of constructing race."

A growing body of research, however, has suggested that sensation seeking can be understood as a joint function of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and the behavioral appetitive system. The current study seeks to investigate the relationship between risky health behaviors and sensation seeking as a joint function of BIS and BAS. Further, the current study seeks to investigate the content of the BAS. Specifically, the current study calls into question the existence of BAS as a meta-construct comprised of Reward Responsiveness, Drive, and Fun Seeking dimensions. Utilizing a sample of undergraduates from four universities (N = 963), several structural models are tested in which a relationship between components of the BAS and the BIS and risky health behavior is mediated by sensation seeking. Alternative models are tested as well. The data here suggest that sensation seeking is a joint product of countervailing motivational forces and that sensation seeking mediates the relationship between BIS/BAS and risky health behavior."

Using an experimental design, two interventions, an advertising literacy lesson and an ad break (a posted statement identifying advertising on a website), were evaluated for their effectiveness at increasing fourth grade childrens ability to identify the commercial sponsor of an advergame and detect the games persuasive intent. Results indicate that even a modest educational intervention made a difference in increasing childrens comprehension of the commercial sponsor and motive of the advergame. However, exposure to the ad break  even when preceded by an educational lesson about online advertising -- did not improve childrens comprehension."

Increasing the social networks of youth to include local community leaders may increase social capital and have an impact on how youth view their communities. This paper reports on an intervention involving the integration of the social networking website Facebook with a community-based social media website created by rural high school students. Students worked with local business and volunteer leaders in an effort to link local youth to community leaders through Facebook and the community-based social media website. Quantitative and qualitative data reflect the extent to which social capital was affected by the technological intervention, incorporating both ICT training and application of skills learned to create the integration mentioned above."

Two field experiments were designed to employ communication messages to increase employees use of stairways versus elevators in office buildings. Both used a pre-test/post-test design with a focused message intervention. Study One was implemented across six weeks; Study Two across three. Messages were oriented to point of choice decisions, and incorporated both cue-based messages, as well as employing strong arguments. Participants were observed at designated times in public areas making the decision to use the stairs or elevator.
Both studies substantially increased stair use during the intervention period, and this increase lasted into the final phase of observation when there were no messages presented. In both studies most workers continued to use the elevators rather than stairs, and surveys indicated that control and barrier beliefs were the source rather than normative or attitudes about the behavior itself."

Based on findings from several countries, two main factors affecting the extent of an incumbency bonus are presented: The distribution of power in a political system and changes in political journalism. To test these assumptions, a content analysis of five national elections in Denmark is conducted (4,592 news stories). It is shown that the more uneven power is distributed in a political system, the larger the incumbency bonus is. The results for the effects of a changing political journalism on the incumbency bonus are less clear but nevertheless point at a trade-off between non-substantial issue coverage and an incumbency bonus. It is concluded that the approach towards a more systematic comparison of research results from different countries is promising in explaining the antecedents and dynamics of bias in news coverage."

2009-0732,Indian Idol: Reality TV and the Making of Mobile Publics,Provincializing Media Studies,,,,Paper,Indian Idol: Reality TV and the Making of Mobile Publics,Provincializing Media Studies,"In summer of 2007, media coverage of Indian Idol focused on how people in northeast India cast aside decades-old separatist identities to mobilize support for Amit Paul, a finalist from the region. While some fans set up websites and blogs to rally support, others formed a fan club and roped in businessmen to distribute pre-paid mobile phone cards and manage 24-hour telephone centers for voting. Furthermore, with politicians getting involved and a state government appointing Amit Paul a brand ambassador of peace and communal harmony, this moment of fan expression soon took on an explicitly political character. However, this television public in northeast India did not have a lasting impact and disintegrated soon after Amit Paul was declared runner-up.

Situating this media event in relation to (a) the socio-historical context of identity politics in the northeast, and (b) relationship between media and political mobilization in postcolonial India, I argue that the dynamics of reality TV has led to the creation of mobile publics. Drawing on postcolonial understandings of publics, I use mobile publics as a heuristic for assessing new cultural and political possibilities that convergence between TV and new media technologies has engendered. This case study will set the stage for a critical examination of the relationship between media and the public sphere in postcolonial contexts."

Women refrain from using direct aggression during intra-sexual competition because they invest more into potential offspring than men and consequently experience greater reproductive costs from injury. Instead, women compete for mates through indirect means by socially denigrating rivals via gossip and enhancing their appearance in order to successfully compete with other women. An experimental design investigated indirect aggression among heterosexual women (N = 107) during intra-sexual competition. Participants were randomly assigned to one condition of a between subjects factorial design: 2 (primed sexual strategy: long-term/short-term) x 2 (intra-sexual competition: high/low). Participants responded to several proxy measures of indirect aggression during intra-sexual competition (willingness to communicate, and evaluations of the promiscuity of other women) as well as indirect forms of inter-sexual attraction (endorsement of cosmetic augmentations of physical appearance). Research questions test the influence of 2D:4D digit ratio asymmetry (a measure of in utero androgens, testosterone and estrogen, and genomic stress) on these proxy measures of indirect aggression and endorsement of cosmetic enhancements. Findings suggest that women communicate indirect aggression in a manner that negotiates the reproductive disadvantage of digit ratio asymmetry."
2009-0734,Indirect Ingratiation,Goal- and Message-Centered Approaches to Interpersonal Communication,,,,Paper,Indirect Ingratiation,Goal- and Message-Centered Approaches to Interpersonal Communication,"Most of the literature on impression management considers direct tactics such as mentioning personal achievements in order to self-promote and complimenting the other person in order to ingratiate. These direct tactics can backfire if the target recognizes the hidden motive behind them. Therefore, in many cases people use indirect impression management tactics. Cialdini and colleagues (1976) have shown that people tend to promote themselves indirectly by associating themselves with successful others or by magnifying the characteristics of others to whom they are already connected. The current research suggests that when the motive is ingratiation, instead of highlighting the success of another person who is close to the impression manager, the impression manager highlights the success of a person who is close to the evaluator. The four experiments of the current research established this effect and examined its consequences for the impression manager and for the evaluator."

Professionals' Perceptions of the Impact of the Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade Agreement on the Local Advertising Industry,Transforming Media Landscape: Ongoing Articulation Processes Among Audiences and Mass Media Industries in the Americas,"Advertising in Spanish has had a tremendous level of growth in the last decade. Although the demographic expansion of Spanish-speakers in the United States is an important contributor to this phenomenon, in reality the largest margin of growth has occurred in Latin America. Mexico alone has gone from not being in the top ten advertisers to occupying the sixth ranking worldwide, ahead of Brazil, France, Italy and Canada. Though there is a significant amount of research being conducted in the United States on the industry and Hispanic consumers, including my own analysis of the role of the media, the marketplace and policymakers in constituting this market-driven ethnicity, Central America and the Caribbean nations have been neglected. With the Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade Agreement, the landscape for the advertising industry in the signing Latin American countries is bound to change. Whereas the economic impact can be measured by the figures of advertising expenditure compared to agency ownership, the perception of those being affected cannot. This study addresses this by conducting in-depth interviews with advertisers from the region, thus providing necessary benchmark for future comparison."

Researched with reference to secondary historical sources, as well as to primary source texts from the newspapers coverage, the study shows how the citys pro-segregationist newspapers, the Times-Picayune and the States-Item, came to endorse the desegregation of the local school system. As the crisis developed at two levelsbetween the state and the federal government over Louisiana Gov. Jimmie Daviss threat to close the schools to prevent desegregation, and between the state and the City of New Orleans over the governors threat to close the schools against the will of the citys business communitythe two New Orleans newspapers found themselves caught between their loyalty to segregation and the citys need to exert its power of home-rule against the governor. The textual analysis presented that instead of leading the fight for or against desegregation, the newspapers relied on a detached objectivity to passively support the more pragmatic frame developed by two leading community organizations and intended to accommodate desegregation to preserve the citys business community."

Sixty parents completed 24-hour television diaries when their children were ages 1 and 4. At age 4, children completed a series of cognitive outcome measures and parents completed an executive functioning measure. Results indicated that high levels of exposure to programs designed for adults at both time points, and high levels of household television usage during preschool was associated with poorer executive functioning at age 4. Furthermore, high preschool exposure to programs designed for adults was associated with poorer cognitive outcomes at age 4. However, exposure to programs designed for young children at either time point had neither a positive nor negative association with preschool outcome measures. These results suggest that exposure to television content is an important factor in understanding the relation between media exposure and developmental outcomes."

We examined whether 92 12- to 24-month-old children (41 girls, 51 boys) learned words and problem-solving strategies from an educationally-focused DVD. Analysis of behavioral measures of word-learning revealed no effects of DVD viewing. None of the children demonstrated increased vocabulary knowledge related to viewing the DVD. An ANOVA of childrens problem-solving revealed a three-way interaction between time, age group, and media. The children in the older age group (18-24 months) who received a DVD were most likely to demonstrate an increase in performing a problem-solving action highlighted in the DVD. However, further analysis confirmed this result was related to statistical anomalies in the sample. These findings suggest children must develop certain representational skills before they can learn from a television screen."

Data collected from 401 female respondents aged 16 to 19 were used to test six different hypothesized Path Models using path analysis. As opposed to merely revalidating male-female differences (Park, 2005), six IOPI pathways were separately constructed to examine the plausible role that family (mother) and female peers play in propagating the thin ideal among girls. This study highlights the potential role that mothers, female peers, educators, female health campaign planners and policy makers can play to prevent girls from heading towards dangerous curves during adolescence."

If found and employed in the service of a change agent, opinion leaders can greatly increase the rate of information transfer in a population. Previous research has attempted to develop methods of locating opinion leaders, but the available methods are either cost prohibitive or ineffective. A new, self-report measurement technique was developed by Boster, Kotowski, and Andrews (2006), and was found to have high reliability and high validity. The measure has three components that identify the connector, persuader, and maven (CPM) properties found in opinion leaders. The measure was developed in a student sample, however, and needed to be validated with a non-student sample before being deployed in campaign settings. The present study investigates the scales in a nationally-representative, non-student sample, finding that the CPM scales possess equivalent psychometric properties in non-student samples as student samples. With data demonstrating the generalizability of the measures, and finding that about one out of 20 American adults has high levels of the three CPM properties, campaign designers can have more confidence in the measures application and can use national population norms to develop design criteria."

Yet, by some measures, we have done a poor job at fostering scientific habits of mind in schools. Recent research on informal games-based learning indicates that such technologies and the communities they evoke may be one viable alternative  not as a substitute for teachers and classrooms, but as an alternative to textbooks and science labs. This paper presents empirical evidence about the potential of games for fostering scientific habits of mind. Using codes based on AAAS benchmarks (1993), Chinn and Malhotras (2002) framework for evaluating inquiry tasks, and Kuhns (1991) epistemological framework, we examine the scientific habits of mind and dispositions that characterize online discussion forums of the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft. Eighty-six percent of the forum discussions were posts engaged in social knowledge construction rather than social banter. Over half of the posts evidenced systems based reasoning, one in ten evidenced model-based reasoning, and 65% displayed an evaluative epistemology in which knowledge is treated as an open-ended process of evaluation and argument."

This presentation considers an approach to exploring the authenticity of information through the lens of Dervins Sense-Making Methodology (SMM). If the nature of information is viewed as a process or product of dialogue, which begins with the dialogue between the observer/writer and his topic, then engaging information users in SMMs disciplined dialogue, when considering the authenticity of information, may enable them to assemble authentic and coherent narratives from disparate and even conflicting voices."

Researchers sought to understand differences among Justices in type of prompts given to lawyers at oral argument. In order to accomplish this, we categorized each prompt by a Justice as one of the following types: open-ended (who, what, when, where, why and how questions); disjunctive (question offers alternative possible answers); yes/no questions; leading questions (question itself suggests desired answer); rhetorical questions; and declarations or statements. These categories were derived from literature in interpersonal communication and legal studies.

This study extends previous cross-sectional research that has established that information seeking across a variety of sources is extensive, and is positively associated with engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors. We studied how active information seeking about cancer prevention influenced three healthy lifestyle behaviors (dieting, exercising, and eating fruits and vegetables) using a two-round nationally representative sample of adults ages 40-70 (n=1795), using propensity scoring to control for potential confounders including baseline behavior. The adjusted odds of dieting at time two were 1.52 [95% CI: 1.05 to 2.19] times higher for those who reported baseline seeking from media and interpersonal sources relative to non-seekers. Baseline seekers ate .44 [95% CI: 0.17, 0.70] more fruits and vegetables per day, and exercised 0.40 [95% CI: 0.19 to 0.61] more days per week at one-year follow-up, compared to non-seekers, controlling for potential confounders. The effects of seeking from media and friends and family on eating fruits and vegetables and exercising were independent of seeking from physicians. We can offer several explanations for why information seeking predicts healthy lifestyle behaviors one year later: people may be gaining information that motivates these behaviors; information sought teaches specific techniques to engage in these behaviors; in addition, the act of information seeking may reinforce a psychological commitment to dieting, eating fruits and vegetables, and exercising."

Infrared radiation is not visible to the human eye, however, humans and animals can sense infrared. Egyptians, in an art form now lost to us, could see heat with their hands. Rattlesnakes, vipers, and bats can still see infrared light today. This paper asks, how does the history and development of infrared imaging coincide with the transformation of human sensory perception, and how do these changes reflect upon the current political, cultural, and wartime practices? The paper will address these questions through a genealogy of the development of infrared imaging from 1800 through its current uses and representations in the U.S. military."
2009-0746,Injecting Values: The Influence of Ideology and Attribute Framing on HPV Vaccine Mandate Opinion,Persuasive Messages (High Density),,,,Paper,Injecting Values: The Influence of Ideology and Attribute Framing on HPV Vaccine Mandate Opinion,Persuasive Messages (High Density),"Attribute framing theory posits that positively framed information leads to more favorable evaluations than logically equivalent negatively framed information. A survey-based experiment (N= 637) tested whether attribute framing of HPV vaccine effectiveness (70% effective versus 30% ineffective) influenced ratings for perceived vaccine effectiveness and opinion on vaccine mandates for schoolgirls and whether ideology acted as a moderator. The study found that on average, the positive framing resulted in higher vaccine ratings and mandate support. Controlling for prior mandate opinion showed that liberal policy opinion was most influenced by the attribute framing, F(2,343)=4.37, p≤.01. When the framing emphasized vaccine effectiveness, liberals were more supportive of the HPV vaccine mandates and when the vaccine ineffectiveness was emphasized, they were less supportive of the vaccine mandate. The findings lend support to the idea that valence framing may have differential influence on liberals and conservatives policy opinions in cases where health policy is considered ideologically controversial."
2009-0747,Innovation or Legitimation? Consultancy Services and Functions in Political Communication,Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Innovation or Legitimation? Consultancy Services and Functions in Political Communication,Political Communication Poster Session,"Consultants in political communication offer a broad range of services and fulfill a variety of functions that are seldom compared with one another. Studies on campaigners or lobbyists tend to represent quite separate fields of research. A nationwide survey on consultants in Switzerland contributes to overcoming this blind spot by means of an inductive empirical research design, which allows us to question what services consultants actually perform and what functions they attribute to different services. The results show that lobbying, political PR, and (initiative, referenda and election) campaigns constitute the main areas of service. These service areas are associated with different functions. Lobbyists in particular define themselves as partisan players closely involved in political decision-making. In contrast, political PR and campaigning is understood more in terms of horizontal or vertical mediation. Campaigners mention pragmatic functions, such as the provision of an up-to-date infrastructure, most often. Overall, consultants highlight the ability to facilitate innovations through an independent outside perspective. Reputation is regarded as the most important criteria when it comes to the selection of a specific agency. This underlines the importance of impression management as a common challenge for consultants in different fields of political communication."

A Longitudinal Analysis of German Party Web Sites in the 2002 and 2005 National Elections,Political Campaigns Around the World (High Density),"Scholars have seldom tested the innovation and normalization paradigm of e-campaigning over time. Particularly outside the U.S., there is a lack of comparative analyses of candidate or party Web sites that deal with the concepts temporal validity and scope. The paper addresses this research gap through a longitudinal content and structural analysis of German party Web sites in the 2002 and 2005 National Elections. The results provide empirical evidence of a twofold development in e-campaigning that challenges past assumptions of the innovation and normalization framework. Specifically, the paper proposes two theoretical revisions: First, innovation and normalization do not represent mutually exclusive opposites of a scientific controversy, but rather signify a dynamic conceptual continuum of parallel stages in the evolution of e-campaigning. Second, this continuum is affected by the Web site dimension as well as by the status of the political actors being observed."
2009-0749,"In Search of a Niche: Differentiation Among Internet Search Engines, 1993-2000",Critical and Cultural Perspectives on ICTs,,,,Paper,"In Search of a Niche: Differentiation Among Internet Search Engines, 1993-2000",Critical and Cultural Perspectives on ICTs,"Search engines are the principal parties mediating information flows between online information providers and Internet users worldwide. As a result, search engines have an increasing impact on the distribution of, e.g., commercial, political, and health-related information. Currently, Google dominates the search engine industry, and scholars have expressed concerns regarding its all-too-powerful position as gatekeeper of the Web. A more differentiated search engine industry would be preferable, as societal influence would then be distributed over more actors. To explore circumstances that could facilitate more differentiation, this study reviews the competitive dynamics in the search engine industry from its inception, in 1993, to 2000. It particularly focuses on the period 1996-2000, which showed a sudden inflow of new, mostly specialized, search engines. We propose organization ecology, a theoretical approach neighbouring evolutionary economics, as a possible explanation for the observed market dynamics. Organization ecology argues that in concentrated markets, generalists are forced to focus on the market core, which inevitably goes at the cost of their more peripheral interests. This, in turn, creates opportunities for new firms to enter the market. To test this theory, we analyzed micro- and macro-level competitive processes in a population of 137 international search engines, measured for each quarter year, over seven years. Results suggest that the inflow of new search engines indeed coincided with (1) intensified competition between large generalists (e.g. Altavista, Infoseek, Hotbot), and (2) declining competitive pressure in the market periphery. As a result, conditions for new search engines to enter the market improved."

In this paper I discuss how teenagers with access to this media landscape are able to act and contribute to society with their own arguments and communication strategies. Is in this way that I was interested in revisiting past web impressions of social educational movements, as it was the case of the Chilean adolescent student movement in favor of the right to quality public education, in 2006. Their communication strategies and the ways they used for ensuring their voices would be hear at national media levels were critically influence. They finally achieve the abolition of the education law imposed in the dictatorship, and still in force after sixteen years of democracy.Inspired by a qualitative emergent approach, I was on the track of any trace left by the Chilean adolescents students on the web. More specifically, I followed in the footsteps of youth arguments and communication strategies employed in different media and technologies by the leaders of the student youth movement, as ways to address their educational discourse to the country and the government, and dispersed on the web. Detectable evidence that something has passed includes web logs, wikipedia, national and international online newspapers, You Tube, radio interviews, internet TV interviews and also outside the web support mobile phones."

The ICT utilization has particularly facilitated grassroots movement, empowering citizens. The current study examined seven different ICT applications regarding their utilities in the process of the Beef protest, a grassroots mass demonstration occurring in Korea 2008. Examination revealed that, while informational use of television was negatively associated with the extent of protest participation, the utilization of organizational websites, Internet portals, and mobile-phone as informational instruments positively predicted protest participation. Likewise, while mass media-affiliated websites were negatively associated with protest participation, Internet portals and mobile-phones were actively utilized as coordination tools in the process of protest. The results show the implication of highly converged ICTs on civic empowerment and creation of counter-public sphere."

This presentation will describe how CHESS has been able to buffer or prevent many of the psychosocial consequences of cancer diagnosis and treatment on patients and their families. One trial indicates that moderately complex versions may be more effective than fully-interactive ones. Another demonstrates that integrating a human cancer information mentor with CHESS is the most efficacious. And a third trial with lung cancer patients found life prolonged for several months, as compared to patients whose needs were only served by the Internet in general. Next steps include achieving broad dissemination within a large HMO, replicating and understanding the life-prolonging effects, and using a cell-phone based system to prevent cancer recurrence through lifestyle changes and self-management."

Two studies employed eye-tracking to observe online processing during video viewing. One-year-olds, 4-year-olds, and adults watched unedited segments of Sesame Street or segments with shots in random order. This manipulation was intended to disrupt integration of information across cuts. With unedited video, spread of fixations over the screen decreased with age, while viewers use of cuts increased. Four-year-olds and adults centered fixations following cuts, and adults centered fixations more often following cuts to new segments (unrelated) than following cuts between shots within a segment (related). With random-edit video, adults no longer differentiated related and unrelated cuts. Findings suggest a developmental trend in integration of information across cuts, crucial to understanding video. This study supports earlier research, suggesting growth of systematic video processing between 1 and 4 years and systematic attention strategies when adults watch video."

As part of this effort, this paper argues for an integral approach to the theoretical understanding of cultural Fusion Theory. We introduce a model of a non-sequentially growing interface in multidimensional cultural functioning. This growth model incorporates a stratified order perspective as a main ingredient to its theoretical construction, in a way that replicates the connection between ones hermeneutic horizon and decisions for cultural behavior. Additionally, this connection, analogous to and derived from the quantum theory of superposition, is used to extend and support the theory of cultural fusion. We argue that widely recognized adaptation models are based primarily on the functional model and are inadequate to understand multicultural decision making. Increased multicultural contact necessitates an investigation separate from brute behavior observations. Fusion theory can be a valuable tool for addressing multicultural functioning."

While few scholars would deny the human impact of technology, many linguistic treatments of technical knowledge and action focus on how objects of inquiry and basic human perception are principally constructed via cultural dynamics and sequential practices. Many linguistic studies are actually misinterpreted in ways that ignore their engagement with material things. Yet, other studies seem to reproduce an old dichotomy that separates signs from material consequences. Is there a way to resolve these tensions? Extrapolating from learning processes in science and technology, one approach might be to bring ideas about Peircian semiotics, embodied imagination (Rosebery et al. 2005), and residual reality (Keller 1992) into conversation. This approach may offer one way to understand how objects of inquiry are produced interactionally, but in ways that cannot be separated from certain material interactions with the world."

Educational claims associated with these media frequently include references to early social and emotional development, which may be facilitated via modeling of positive interactions with caregivers and peers. The present research examined the number and quality of social interactions depicted in a representative sample of 55 infant programs. Surprisingly few onscreen interactions were found overall, with caregiver-child and peer-to-peer interactions representing only 10% and 25% of total character appearances, respectively. Moreover, only a small portion of the interactions shown were high-quality (active interactions with caregivers, cooperative or parallel play with peers). Given an audience targeted during a crucial period of early social and emotional development, it is interesting that so little modeling of quality interactions is depicted despite claims suggesting otherwise."

Situational variables such as the richness and responsiveness of the dialogic environment affect the outcome of the communication encounter because they facilitate the users movement through time and space. By focusing on the concepts of interactive dialogue in the Sense-Making Methodology context, we can further investigate the role of information and communication in health behaviors at the individual and social level."

In many cases students who study abroad experience homesickness, discontentment, and/or are unsatisfied with their current situation. Research has shown that friendship formation plays a significant role in the study abroad experience and that international students form intriguing social networks. First, they have co-national friends from their own country. Second, they have other international friends. Third, they have friends from the host country. These unique friendship combinations can be further examined through a social network lens by assigning a strength to each; strong tie/best friend, medium tie/basic friend or weak tie/acquaintance. The goal of the current study is to identify what friendship characteristics lead to International students varying levels of homesickness, contentment, and satisfaction while living abroad. An exploratory survey was administered to 72 international students that examined the relationship between friendship networks, homesickness, contentment, and satisfaction. Findings suggest that the more friends one has from the host country the less homesick they are, the more content they are, and the more satisfied they are with life in general. Furthermore, findings also indicate the importance of strong tie friendships and varying friendship ties within a network, specifically with friends from the host country. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."

The analysis utilizes the quantitative data collected from 107 one-on-one interviews with undergraduate students at a university of a moderate-level ethnic diversity over a five-year period. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, results show that individuals whose existing networks of daily contacts, casual friends, and close friends are more integrated ethnically, are more associative toward ethnically dissimilar others in general, that individuals whose ethnic group is larger in size tend to be less associative toward members of smaller ethnic groups, and that the negative theoretical relationship between relative ingroup strength and associative behavior tends to be even stronger at more intimate levels of interethnic relationships."

This paper explores this question. The paper examines the three key variables influencing internal communication  trust, commitment, and satisfaction. The paper applies meta-analysis methodology. Key findings indicate that, initial success and enthusiasm in employees willingness to use ICTs for communication often waned and is met with the reality that ICTs are used by top management to maintain the existing organizational norms and preserve authority rather than empowers employees. Also, the paper offers advice or recommendations for the use of ICT in both co-located and dispersed virtual team and organizational environment."

However, the globalization of multi-vocal, multi-directional and multi-layered media flows have made redundant many established ways of thinking about international communication. This, combined with the internationalization of higher education, has contributed to a rethink on research and teaching of this field of study. Focusing on Asia, this paper will critique the epistemological limitations of the study of international communication, necessitated in part by the increasing importance of China and India in global communication and media discourses, arguing that these two ancient civilizations with modern geo-political aspirations can have profound implications on the teaching of international communication. The paper will highlight two key areas: an emphasis on comparative history of media and communication; and the role of religion and culture in international communication.

2009-0770,International Research Collaboration: Opportunities and Obstacles  Learnings from the United States,dentifying Trends and Practices in Public Relations: International Research Insights and Methodological Challenges,,,,Paper,International Research Collaboration: Opportunities and Obstacles  Learnings from the United States,Identifying Trends and Practices in Public Relations: International Research Insights and Methodological Challenges,"The second paper, based on a similar US survey of public relations (communications) practitioners, addresses the concept of equivalence as it applies to methodological challenges in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on a multi-national basis, by focusing on three issues: (1) variances in sample size, accessibility, and response rate; (2) variances in language and terminology, and (3) variances in the categorization of organizations.
Issue #1: Variances in sample size, accessibility, and response rate - The sample for the GAP study in the United States is all public relations/communications decision makers, i.e. those with top-level managerial responsibility in organizations having communications functions (excluding PR agencies). To reach this audience the Strategic Public Relations Center combined its pre-existing list from GAP IV with lists purchased from appropriate industry publications and other data sources, with the result being a 10,000 person database. Respondents were invited to participate either by hard copy questionnaire or web-based survey instrument. A 5% response rate (520 respondents) resulted. By comparison, a similar study conducted in Sweden achieved a response rate in excess of 40%. What are the key factors that contribute to such variances, and how can equivalence be established?
Issue #2: Variances in language and terminology  In all of the GAP studies the term public relations has been used interchangeably with the term communications, as is common practice in the profession in the United States. However, in some cultures, i.e. Romania, the term public relations carries a very negative connotation more akin to that of propaganda as that latter term is used in Western cultures. This may lead one to conclude that communications is a preferable term for use in multi-national research, but in lesser developed societies communications may be thought of in an entirely different context, i.e. telecommunications. How can one conduct multi-national research on a topic for which there is no common, unbiased, transnational nomenclature?
Issue #3: Variances in the categorization of organizations  In the GAP studies organizations are categorized as being either: public companies that are then divided into sub-categories based on their gross revenues; private companies that are then divided into sub-categories based on their gross revenues; not-for-profit agencies, and governmental agencies. In Europe the typical categories are: joint stock company (i.e. owned by multiple owners and quoted on a stock market); private company (i.e. owned by a small number of owners and not quoted on a stock market); government owned organizations or institutions; and non-profit organization. In China the corporate categories are: state-owned enterprises; private companies; and collectively-owned enterprises, with all three possibly being publicly or privately owned. How does the team of researchers draw appropriate parallels and avoid inappropriate comparisons when common, precisely defined categorical distinctions are lacking?"

The Internet Requests for Comments (RFC) process, which began in 1969, offers a documentary record of technical decision-making for the Internet that now includes over 5000 texts. This paper presents findings from research mining this discourse for the ways in which technical decision-makers dealt (and deal) with legal and policy issues.
It will provide a framework for thinking about interactions between technical and legal decision-making for electronic communication, provide exemplars of each of the multiple ways in which these types of decision-making interact, look at what law-makers can learn about policy issues from technical thinkers and vice versa, and explore interactions between the evolution of the decision-making discourse and the development of formal policy-making procedures and institutions for the Internet and other technological systems."

This paper argues that in the context of concentrated disadvantage, previous forms of social contact, including the telephone and face-to-face communication, compelled spatial and temporal costs to communication not generally experienced in settings with less social inequality. The Internet reduces the transaction costs of communication, within local space as much as it does across distant space, and in turn, undermines contextual constraints on collective efficacy. This paper is based on the results of a three-year naturalistic experiment that examined the use of the Internet for communication at the neighborhood level. The analysis includes a modeling of the ecological characteristics associated with neighborhoods that adopted the Internet as a means of local information exchange, and a comparison of the content of electronic messages exchanged within areas of advantage and those of extreme disadvantage."
2009-0774,"Internet Use, Cynicism, and Skepticism in Young Citizens' Attitudes Towards Political Decision Making","Cynicism, Efficacy, and Social Capital",,,,Paper,"Internet Use, Cynicism, and Skepticism in Young Citizens' Attitudes Towards Political Decision Making","Cynicism, Efficacy, and Social Capital","This study has two purposes: one is to examine the role of Internet use in young citizens political decision making; the other is to investigate cynicism and skepticism in young citizens attitude towards political decision making.
A Web survey (n=580) of college students at a public university indicates that internet use for political information positively associates with young citizens political involvement. Cynicism and skepticism in citizens attitude towards politics are distinct constructs and have different roles in political decision making. Political skepticism is different from cynicism in that skepticism may motivate people to seek political information from the Internet to confirm or disconfirm their doubts, leading to higher levels of political involvement.
This study has extended the current research on the Internet use and political decision making. The findings of the study calls for a need to further investigate the role of the Internet in political decision making."

We believe this concept can assist scholars who are studying the use of media in organizational settingssettings in which participants increasingly use media to enhance or restrict accessibility, to unobtrusively monitor and influence interactions, and to participate in multiple simultaneous interactions, that is, to multicommunicate."

Further, the game has garnered legions of fans, from the average sports fan to children to the casual observer. As Aden (1995) argued, baseball, as the saying goes, is Americas game (p. 20). Scholars have explored the symbolic power of baseball (see Aden, 1999; Trujillo, 1992; Trujillo, 1994), yet few have explored the ways that fans of baseball express their fandom. This study was designed to fill this void, by exploring the ways in which baseball fans at the Steve Raven Memorial Stadium, the stadium of a mid-sized Midwestern University, communicate. In essence, this investigation seeks to answer the question of how baseball fans express their fandom. To explore the communicative practices of baseball fans, I have employed ethnographic methods to directly observe how fans talk the game of baseball and express their own fandom."

The second aim was to clarify the role of nonverbal cues and visual anonymity in the CMC-interpersonal attraction relationship. Eighty-one unacquainted cross-gender dyads were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: a face-to-face, a visual CMC (i.e., CMC with a webcam), or a text-only CMC condition. Content analysis of the verbal interactions revealed that text-only CMC interactants liked each other more than face-to-face interactants. However, there was no difference in liking between text-only CMC and visual CMC. Depth of self-disclosure and question asking mediated the CMC-liking relationship. Again, there was no difference between the text-only and visual CMC conditions, suggesting that it is not the visual anonimity of CMC that accounts for the higher levels of interpersonal attraction in CMC."

Media, Migration, and Public Beliefs","Keywords: Conceptualisations, Naming, and Meanings of Ethnicity, Race, and Diaspora","This paper presents an analysis of data regarding peoples knowledge of and beliefs about migration into the Republic of Ireland. The data in question has been generated through an interviewer-administered survey conducted with participants primarily in the west, mid-west and south of the country. The findings address such topical issues as common knowledge and popular beliefs regarding: numbers and nationalities entering Ireland; reasons for inward migration; welfare entitlements of asylum seekers and peoples perceptions about the relative ease with which diverse groups integrate. Our findings will be interpreted taking into account participants age, education, religiosity, occupation and contact with immigrants. Popular beliefs will be contextualised by comparison to information from other data sources. Following on from our earlier work regarding media coverage of asylum seekers and refugees in Ireland, the findings will also address the question of where people source their information regarding immigration from and will examine the relationship between knowledge, belief and information sources. Given our wider concerns as to the degree to which the mainstream mass media in Ireland constitutes a public sphere, we have undertaken our analysis in the context of the long-standing debates within media and communication studies focused on how media content shapes public perceptions and beliefs about socially contentious issues."

Structural equation modeling indicated the model provided good fit to the data. Overall, the findings present a complex portrait of forgiveness as an interactional process. Results reveal that forgiveness communication forms (i.e., direct, indirect, and conditional) are differentially affected by offense- and offender-related variables. Whereas direct forgiveness was most strongly predicted by offender response (e.g., apology, remorse), indirect and conditional forgiveness were most strongly predicted by offense attributes (e.g., severity, blameworthiness). Several paths in the model concerning the effects of offense attributes and forgiveness communication on proximal and distal relational outcomes were also supported. Notably, offense severity, blameworthiness, and conditional forgiveness positively predicted relational damage from transgressions. Direct forgiveness, in contrast, negatively predicted relational damage. Nearly identical paths were supported for ongoing negative affect, which is the degree to which negative emotionality from transgressions persists after forgiveness has been communicated to an offender. Finally, relational damage from transgressions was a robust negative predictor of current relational satisfaction."

This paper discusses the promise these innovations hold for participatory media and highlights their potentials for local communities. As advertising-supported media institutions come under increasing strain from outdated business models, the promise of locally-supported, technologically-enabled local journalism is even more compelling. This analysis details policy interventions and reforms necessary to support the widespread uptake of these new technologies. By fleshing out strategies for communities to tap into the underutilized potential of Intranet technologies, we aim to address a growing crisis in the loss of local news productiona crucial underpinning for a vibrant culture and democratic governance."
2009-0781,Introduction: The Role of Public Service Media in the Digital Environment,Public Service Media: Protecting the Public Interest in the Digital Environment,,,,Paper,Introduction: The Role of Public Service Media in the Digital Environment,Public Service Media: Protecting the Public Interest in the Digital Environment,"The role of public service on the internet is disputed. Opponents argue that the internet allows for a free market place of ideas (e.g. low market entry barriers; forms of civic journalism). Thus, public service is not seen as necessary anymore. In contrast, advocates of PSM emphasize the significance of non-commercial publicly funded media beyond traditional broadcasting. Not only do they argue that most traditional justifications for public service still apply but that new problems requiring regulation are emerging. The main claim put forward here is that answers to the question of whether PSM are necessary are innately normative. By confronting justifications for PSM with the realities of the digital environment, this presentation not only adds to our theoretical knowledge about PSM. In addition, it allows us for identifying different ways to protect the public interest in the digital environment and different options to institutionalize PSM."

It compares the national coverage with some past research looking at coverage of local media coverage of survivors (specifically in the cities to which they relocated after the hurricane). The study finds that the two national newspapers and the Atlanta newspaper treat the survivors mostly as victims while the Houston newspaper has an equal number of survivor as victim and survivor as intruder frames.

I argue that these proposed consumer applications embody the logic of individualized security and self-responsibility characteristic of neoliberal political rationality, and reveal how competence with digital technologies has become a fundamental component of our notions of citizenship and self-identity. Responsible, tech-savvy citizens are expected to not only own and make use of a wide range of digital technologies in their everyday life practices, but also to secure, manage, and optimize their devices and personal data. Ultimately, consumer applications are serving an important legitimation function for the much more widespread and effectual institutional uses of biometric surveillance technologies."
2009-0784,Investigative Journalism in China,The Well-Being of Investigative Journalism,,,,Paper,Investigative Journalism in China,The Well-Being of Investigative Journalism,"The situation of investigative journalism in China is a precarious one. There are serious pressures from both the party-state and advertisers that have reduced the opportunities for this kind of journalism. On the other hand, investigative journalism proved a very important tool in the economic development of some newspapers, and has both been integrated into their organisational structure and provided what may be termed a professional ideology for journalists. As the pressures on news organisations have grown, they have been forced to respond. Some, notably television but also many newspapers, have more or less abandoned investigative journalism. Others attempt to retain the practice, but adopt a very cautious strategy. In some cases, however, the market position of the newspaper and the self-identity of the journalists mean that they retain a strong commitment to investigative journalism. In this, they are aided by the development of the internet, which provides a good source for stories, an arena in which it is possible to publish material that could not appear in the traditional media, and a way of ensuring that sensational stories gain a wider audience. On the other hand, even those newspapers that pride themselves on maintaining their commitment to this kind of journalism have developed strategies to minimise the negative political and economic consequences of their activity. The article concludes that while investigative journalism in China faces a difficult future, it is very far from entirely defunct."

Exploring the Determinants of Change in Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior in Entertainment Education",Persuasive Messages (High Density),"This study examined how three constructs  involvement with a specific character, involvement with the narrative more generally (Green & Brocks construct of transportation) and viewers emotional reaction to the narrative  work together to produce entertainment education effects. A pretest/posttest survey measured the effects of exposure to a six week lymphoma storyline on regular viewers of a popular television drama, Desperate Housewives. Following Moyer-Guse (2008), we combined liking, perceived similarity, wishful identification, and parasocial interaction into a single construct of involvement with a specific character, Lynette. Transportation was the best predictor of knowledge, attitudes and behavior, followed by viewers emotional reaction. Although character involvement has long been hailed as an important direct predictor of entertainment education effects, a structural equation model indicates that character involvement may be most important for its ability to produce transportation and emotion which, in turn, were directly related to changes in viewers knowledge, attitudes and behavior."

Apple, with its synergistic business measures, seeks to shape all aspects of iPhone users mobile experiences, whether related to hardware, software, content, or service. As Apple attempts to globalize its US success, the iPhone case in China displays many contradictory stories of this ICT-media conglomerates globalization endeavors. This paper presents Apples achievement and disappointment in China side by side, reveals both the creativity of Chinese iPhone users and the limits of their agency, and relativizes the structural obstacles facing Apple that come from the Chinese bureaucratic capitalist party-state and its field surrogate, China Mobile. To make sense of these contradictory stories, we need to bridge the gap between political economic analyses and critical cultural studies and to interpret resistance in light of the power imbalance intensified by media convergence and corporate synergy on the structural level."

The Rhetorical Struggle for the NEA,"Media Policy, Media Systems, and Democracy","In the field of public policy, market-based keywords increasingly dominate how American policy-makers and analysts define problems, processes, and possible solutions. Deborah Stone has organized a framework for understanding and deconstructing this trend, and she identifies several goals that result from a market paradigm. This paper concerns the application of one of those goals, efficiency, to a specific public policy, federal funding of the arts in the United States. The case discussed in this research occurred on March 13, 1997. The Chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, Jane Alexander, testified before the U.S. Congress, arguing for the continued (and increased) funding of the NEA. The paper investigates if and how the National Endowment for the Arts, via Chairwoman Jane Alexander and supportive Congressmen, advocated funding the Endowment by invoking an efficiency argument that was grounded in market-based reasoning. The paper provides a historical account of the use of economics to advocate funding the arts and the implications of that strategy. It then quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes the rhetoric of NEA advocates during the hearing to determine if the discourse challenged the markets primacy in policy making."

We interviewed 134 7 and 10 year old children about the nature of television advertisements and examples of non-spot advertising, using open-ended questions and pictorial prompts (following Owen, Auty & Lewis, 2007). Children demonstrated a significantly more sophisticated understanding of television advertising in comparison to all five examples of non-spot advertising. Children appear to have very limited knowledge of what these alternative marketing tactics involve and consequently lack the cognitive skills to critically evaluate them. Non-spot advertising appears to pose a new challenge for children."
2009-0790,Is Consumerism Still Problematic for Television Producers?,Communication Approaches to the Study of Consumer Culture,,,,Paper,Is Consumerism Still Problematic for Television Producers?,Communication Approaches to the Study of Consumer Culture,"Historically, scholars have assumed that consumerism has smacked of crassness, and audiences have acknowledged that advertising is the price paid for free media content. Media producers have had to negotiate an awkward position; they must provide a receptive environment for advertising messages, while at the same time maintain credibility by generating distance from overt commercialism. In the last 10-15 years, consumer messages have been interwoven with program content, begging the question: As traditional divides between advertising and content dissolve, is consumerism still problematic for media producers? Reality TV has been at the vanguard of integrating advertising messages into content, so it is a ripe genre in which explore this question. I will report briefly on two case studies of Reality TV programs that suggest the answer is yes. Both invoke concepts of authenticity as a means of mitigating the negative taint of blatant consumerism."

(2007) tested humility cues as a potential intervening variable that moderates the relationship between source expertise and the evaluation of the source and message in three countries: the U.S., Singapore, and Japan. Results showed that humility has a main impact on source evaluation across countries, although its interaction with source expertise was statistically insignificant.
This evidence, however, is inconclusive for at least three reasons. First, the induction check items for humility were missing and hence it is uncertain whether it was humility or a similar yet disparate construct (i.e., self-deprecation) that produced the obtained findings. Second, the humility cues were made to induce not only humility but also perception of similarity with the source. Thus, it remains unclear whether the documented findings were due to the induction of humility or perceived similarity. Third, a less rigorous measurement invariance test was performed; different sets of items were used to compare cultural tendencies on a given construct.
This present study replicated the Lapinski et al.s (2007) experiment by improving on these three potential limitations. Results were inconsistent with the previous findings; the main effect for humility on source evaluation was statistically insignificant. The findings also indicate that the supposed humility cues did induce humility rather than self-deprecation. Importantly, a positive evaluation of source resulted when the source was perceived as humble. Participants rated the source unfavorably when perceived as self-deprecating."

Europe is the new front line in this battle for the `hearts and minds' of Muslims and, it is argued, violations of certain human rights are necessary in the name of defending liberal freedoms. This paper explores the paths that liberals take towards an illiberal politics of counter-terrorism and the role that notions of 'Islamism' play. It is argued that the liberal analysis fails to comprehend the complex dynamics of Islamism in Europe - these are explored in some detail, including consideration of groups such as Hizb ut-Tahrir and the writings of Ed Husain and Tariq Ramadan. It is concluded that members of a new generation of European Muslims are creating a globalised Islamic identity that is distanced from the ethnic cultures of their parents, a process that is more likely to lead to new forms of democratic activism than to political violence  unless diverted from this course by counter-productive policies."

Issue identities are therefore a contextually emergent trait. This paper presents a study in which semantic network analysis was used to identify multiple issue identities of the organic foods issue network in the United States. The study also found a boundary zone of overlap between the policy and media areas of the issue network, containing the core concepts of organic foods used to define the issue identity. The ability to locate these core concepts in an issue domain is important to researchers, professional communicators and policy makers, and merits further study in other issue networks."

Discussion of ""virtual reality"" environments or interaction within ""virtual communities"" suggest an assumption that there is something essentially false about such spaces and people's ability to experience true relationships in a computer-generated environment. As the internet has become more embedded in everyday life, the question of what is real in mediated online relationships raises discussion about how people experience truth or truthful interactions in a world increasingly mediated through distanced work in virtual meeting space to leisure time spent in Second Life. A discourse of ""cyber-philosophy,"" led by scholars such as Derrida, Heim, Hayles and Gunkel, has emerged reflecting on what is authentic reality in digitally created environments. This paper will explore core arguments made by these scholars in relation to the question: what is real, and what is true in an age of new media and digital environments?"

Neutral Reporting and Epistemic Political Efficacy,"Cynicism, Efficacy, and Social Capital","This experiment tests effects on audiences of passive, neutral reporting of contradictory factual claims. Exposure to such reporting is found to affect a new self-efficacy construct developed in this study called epistemic political efficacy (EPE), which taps confidence in one's own ability to assess factual political claims. Measurement of EPE is found to be reliable and valid, and effects of neutral reporting on it are found to be conditional on prior interest in the issues under dispute. Implications of this effect and of EPE are discussed. Self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1982) is used as a foundation for arguing that these short-term effects may accumulate over time. Furthermore, just as traditional measures of political efficacy, which emphasize confidence to affect politics, are important for outcomes related to political action (Craig, 1979), EPE may be important for outcomes related to political understanding, opinion formation, and information seeking. EPE offers an alternative explanation for why some citizens tune out of politics and why others tune in in ways that actively disregard factual reality. EPE's apparent malleability offers the hope that specific changes in journalistic practices could improve citizen engagement in both amount and quality."

Rural children who had Internet access at home were more likely to Web surf for materials that already interested them. Rural children who used the Internet more frequently were more likely to chat with other people online. Rural children who wanted to preserve their roots more were less likely to desire an urbanized family in the future. And, unexpectedly, rural children who identified more with others online were less likely to desire an urbanized family. The implications of these results are discussed as well as the need for further research."

Based on ethnographic research the paper tries to understand the complex interplay between the genre idiosyncrasy, audiences and the labour relations in travel guidebook publishing as a model and distinct case of digitalization in creative/cultural industries. Combining political economy with cultural studies, genre analysis with social theory, it has been particularly endeavoured to grasp what are the implications and paradoxes of the convergence between creative labour of professional travel writers or itinerant experts and the co-creative amateur labour of a multitude of readers or tourists with typewriters within the confines of guidebook genre culture."

To explore the relationship between podcasts use and its levels of gratifications among college students, this study investigated students motivations, behaviors and attitudes in uses with respect to podcasts as the medium. Based on a survey sample of 636 college students at a Midwestern university, this study found that students may have six motivations for podcasts: 1) Voyeurism/Social interaction/Companionship, 2) Entertainment/Relaxation/Arousal, 3) Education/Information, 4) Pastime/Escape, 5) Habit, and 6) Convenience. Of the six identified motivations, Education/Information clearly showed that podcasts have become widely used among students as an appealing medium for their school work. Moreover, as similar as the cellular phone study, this study identified a Fashion motivation for podcasts use. Lastly, this study found and discussed noticeable differences and similarities between podcasts and television regarding users motivations, the interrelationships among motivations, and the predictive relationships between motivations and behavioral/attitudinal aspects of using the medium."

What Can Diaries Tell Us About Media Use?",Multitasking in Daily Media Use: Theoretical Approaches and Empirical Explorations,"The pace of life has not only attracted attention in social science but also in the public discourse. There is a wide use of terms like time squeeze or time poverty of the working population in our days. Moreover, time poverty has become a status symbol we demonstrate by doing more things at the same time, like talking on the phone while sitting in a restaurant or running through the park, working on the plane while travelling to a conference or checking e-mails while listening to music. Making use of time saving strategies has already been the topic of Staffan B. Linder (1970) in his famous book The Harried Leisure Class. More than twenty years later Robinson and Godbey (1999) again described forms of time deepening: attempting to speed up a given activity, substituting a leisure activity which can be done more quickly for one that takes longer, doing more than one activity at once or undertaking a leisure activity with more precise regard to time.
Some of these strategies which are supposed to save time are also of great interest in media research. Media researchers have been paying great attention to the phenomenon of simultaneous media use for some years, especially with focus on tv watching. Meanwhile people have a multitude of options concerning media activities. At the same time the discussion about the quality of media reception has become a major topic as well. Additionally, the discussion of the so called always on-phenomenon have raised questions concerning an adequate measurement of parallel media use.
Using the diary method the attempt is to illustrate first the opportunities and restrictions of this kind of data collection and second to discuss alternative ways of measuring how people make use of more choices in a still expanding media environment.

Nevertheless, 35% of American adults represents an enormous number of people and the bulk of users of social networks. This presentation dives into the demographics of teen and adult social network users and looks at how youth use of social networks compares to use by adults, both in frequency, but also in purpose and behavior. The Pew Internet and American Life Project study finds that youth and adults use the sites primarily for maintenance of offline social relationships and that younger users are more acutely concerned about their privacy on online social networks."

Exploring BIRGing and CORFing Behaviors in the Context of Video Game Play.",Game Studies High Density Paper Session,"The human tendencies to bask in reflected glory (BIRG) and cut off reflected failure (CORF) have been primarily examined in the context of high-stakes competitive events such as political elections and sports team affiliations. Among the explanations for BIRGing and CORFing are self-enhancement and self-protection motivations, respectively. While it is easy to disassociate the self from others when the self is not involved in the outcome of a competitive event, the question remains: is it possible for us distance ourselves from our own actions? The dual-role of video game players as both a gamer and an avatar sets up a scenario where it is possible for individuals to distance themselves from their own representations and own actions. Given that our avatars are so closely tied to our own selves, would CORFing be less likely in online game play? Alternatively, if a video game player were to CORF, they would be engaging in self-protection, indicating that there is more at stake during avatar-mediated game-play than simply winning or losing. A 2x2 experiment (N = 94) was conducted to examine if winning or losing in a staged videogame bowling tournament and performing below-average or above-average on an unrelated trivia task would demonstrate BIRGing or CORFing tendencies. Results indicated strong BIRGing and CORFing behaviors in the context of video game play. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Carey's Chicago School: Drafting a Usable Past,"Revisiting Interwar Communication Research: Dewey, Lippmann, and the Chicago School","In developing his ""cultural approach to communication,"" James Carey turned to intellectual history to illustrate what he called ""the fundamental divide among communications scholars."" He was, in the 1970s, an insurgent, fighting to break the monopoly held by the fields long-dominant behavioral science approach. What he did was to narrate an alternative history centered on Charles Horton Cooley, John Dewey and the Chicago School of sociology--identified by Carey as a rich tradition of thinking about communication that was, however, swept aside by the emerging ""effects"" tradition in the late 1930s and quickly obliterated from the fields memory. Carey had recast that ""fundamental divide"" in historical terms, with his particular version of the Chicago School asked to stand in for interpretive communication research. Dewey, Cooley and Park furnished Carey with an eminently usable past, displaced and recoverable""buried treasure,"" to borrow Kurt Danzigers term."

2009-0805,Journalism and Public Interest,Key Concepts in News and Journalism: Objectivity and its Adjacent Concepts,,,,Paper,Journalism and Public Interest,Key Concepts in News and Journalism: Objectivity and its Adjacent Concepts,"Public Interest has become a key concept in Journalism used for the defence of the intrusion of Privacy. An examination of journalists codes of practice from a range of countries reveals that all use the notion of public interest in instructing their members when it is permissible to intrude into a persons private affairs. However, all such codes fail to define the term public interest, and instead merely instruct in what areas of activity the defence is most likely to be applicable, for example, areas of national security, corruption, and so on. The paper set outs, therefore, to empirically examine what journalists, regulators and the general public consider the concept of public interest to involve, indeed, have them attempt a definition of public interest.

The paper will draw upon the interviews made with 22 senior media personnel and regulators, plus 22 general population focus groups and 3 nationally representative surveys. Although reference will be made to the focus groups and the surveys, the paper in the main will concentrate on the interviews with media personnel and regulators.

The central finding to be presented is that media personnel and regulators could not provide a definition of the public interest, and hence could not in any systematic fashion mount a defence for the intrusion of privacy. What, in fact, appeared to be working was an appeal to practice based on cultural assumptions of taste. Thus the paper will question the value of the concept of public interest in understanding journalistic practice."

Objectivity used to be a prized status within journalism. In war corresponding the principles of detachment was a key element in the social construction or formation of identity. Today the idea or ethos of journalistic objectivity has evolved into one of responsible engagement  in which a moral stance is adopted and where accurate reporting demands determining responsibility. Critics argue though, that responsible engagement is highly selective, lacks critical independence and performs a disservice to the public. The categories of objectivity, neutrality, detachment, have to be re-examined as the cultural forms of war corresponding and the ideological framework of journalism in general, changes. Using examples from recent wars and conflicts and from the International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, this paper analyses the engagement and commitment of war correspondents from their assignment to a story to their appearance at The Hague."

Participation in an action-research project run during the 2007 Australian Federal Election, youdecide 2007, allowed the authors to gain first-hand insights into the progress of citizen-led news media in Australia, but also allowed us to develop an account of what the work of facilitating citizen journalism involves. These insights are important to understanding the future of professional journalism and journalism education, as more mainstream media organizations move to accommodate and harness user-created content. The paper considers the relevance of citizen journalism projects as forms of R&D for understanding news production and distribution in participatory media cultures, and the importance of grounded case studies for moving beyond normative debates about new media and the future of journalism."

Using the case study of the publication of the Winograd Commission Report on the 2006 war between Israel and Hizbullah, and integrating different theoretical frameworks for understanding mediatized rituals and the memory work of journalism, the paper analyzes the complex web of interactions between journalists and other social players, between competing news outlets, and among the different cultural roles of journalism. The analysis shows that while the Israeli news media built the publication of the report as a crucial historical event and worked to fill in some of the missing pieces of a successful collective ritual, it also constructed it as a doomed-to-fail, and ultimately unsatisfying, ritual. This dialectical construction allowed the Israeli news media to reconcile its conflicting roles as news provider and ritual agent; repair its own failures in covering the second Lebanon War; and position itself as better qualified than the commission to both investigate and remember the war. The paper also demonstrates how competing media players advanced different reparative narratives, collaborated with different social and political players, and invoked the memory of the war in ways which served these different interpretations."

the content of 15 prominent, broad reaching media (newspaper and magazines as well as TV-news,
radio news and online news) since 1990. Based on extensive data concerning the selection and presentation
of news, this presentation describes a significant change of selection criteria in German
journalism and a differentiation of the ways events and topics are presented in mass media .First
findings may be subsumed to a central trend: The entertaining quality of news and their individual
relevance for the audience have become more decisive for their selection and presentation. This is
obvious by means of different variables: Events which can be characterized as dramatic, negative
and person-related have become more important in news selection. As political topics lose their
prominent status, other topics, such as lifestyle, health, science, economy and sports, have gained
importance. Visualisation by means of photos, graphs, illustrations and videos increasingly shapes
the presentation of news in all media types."

by 15 interviews with experienced managing editors as well as by observing their newsrooms, in
order to analyze the processes of communication, coordination and decision-making. Both change
and stability become obvious in different spheres of journalism:
1. Organization of the newsroom: Coordinating editorial work at a newsdesk is a new phenomenon
in German journalism. New ways of labor division oscillate between individualization and specialization
on the one hand and team work and rotating functions in the newsroom on the other
hand.
2. Institutional circumstances: Journalists identify technological changes, increasing economic
pressure and changing expectations of the audience as decisive parameters for the changes of
their working conditions.
3. Decision criteria: Today, editors explain their publishing decisions concerning the selection and
presentation of news as well as the selection of sources and strategies of gaining information
more often with economic or technologic circumstances.
4. Working routines: Communication and coordination hold decisive parts of the journalists work,
which is increasingly affected by technical duties."
2009-0811,Journalistic Roles and Levels of Analysis,Role Remodel: New Directions for Journalistic Role Conception Research,,,,Paper,Journalistic Roles and Levels of Analysis,Role Remodel: New Directions for Journalistic Role Conception Research,"Most research on journalists perceptions of their roles has been conducted at the individual level in various surveys of journalists in the U.S. and elsewhere. A few studies have attempted to correlate these individual perceptions with the actual news content (or descriptions of it) that journalists produce. These studies have generally found weak correlations at best. The author, based on his decades of research on American journalists, speculates that a chief reason for these weak correlations is the level of analysis used. The author suggests that using the organizational level of analysis, rather than the individual level, would result in stronger correlations between journalistic role orientations and the kind of news coverage produced. This presentation reviews some of the previous studies of journalists role perceptions and argues for employing an organizational level of analysis. It also comments on the difficulties of measurement of journalistic role orientations in news content."

Some of these studies have added indigenous roles derived from the cultural and historical circumstances of the locations these journalists work in. This presentation will discuss findings of studies in select African and Asian countries, conducted by this author, that have used this approach. The goal will be comparative; but, more importantly, it will also be to discuss how journalists in these countries may overlap, extend, or possibly contradict the roles considered intuitive in Western democracies, particularly in the United States, and how the cultural and historical backgrounds of the international journalists may inform these role conceptions. In view of the currency of the topic of journalism education (witness the 2007 UNESCO and WJEC recommendations) around the world, the presentation will also consider the implications of the role conceptions for journalism education."
2009-0813,Journalists as Actors in Social Dramas of Apology,Titillating News,,,,Paper,Journalists as Actors in Social Dramas of Apology,Titillating News,"During the last decades, the abundance of apologies made by public actors has lent credence to the claim that we are living in the ""age of apology"". The extensive coverage of these gestures by the press in many cases aroused heated public struggles over the norm transgressed, the appropriateness of the verbal compensation, and the transgressors future in the public arena. This paper analyzes the reasons for the interest taken by journalists in covering and generating apology discourse, the active role played by them at each stage of what I term social dramas of apology (SDA), and the professional implications stemming from their involvement. The study analyzes 559 SDA that emerged in Israeli public discourse from 1997-2004. The findings suggest that journalists are responsible for both shaking up the social/political order and for restoring equilibrium to it. Their active involvement takes various forms. Journalists (1) frame actions as transgressions, (2) play the role of instigator, or, alternately, the arbitrator, and (3) help the public, in the last stage of the drama, to determine whether transgressors should be incorporated back into the social structure. Lastly, it is suggested that journalists active participation in SDA entails some challenging ethical implications."

It explores the issue through empirical work carried out at the site of the UK Parliament at Westminster. Findings are based on semi-structured interviews with 60 Members of Parliament [MPs] and 20 national political journalists.
The research initially confirmed many of the observations of earlier studies in the field. UK journalist-source relations still resemble Gans (1979) original tug-of-war description of an ever-shifting power balance between the two sides. Such interactions, in turn, are reflected in more compliant or adversarial news coverage. Of greater interest here, the interviews also revealed that such relations have come to play a significant role in the micro-level politics of the political sphere itself. This is because reporter-politician relations and objectives have become institutionalised, intense and subject to a form of mediated reflexivity. Consequently, politicians have come to incorporate such reporter interactions into their daily thinking and behaviour. As such, journalists are seen as more than a simple means of message promotion to the public. They also act, often inadvertently, as information intermediaries and sources for politicians trying to gauge daily developments within their own political arena."

During this task, their facial expressions were recorded and tracked using a web-camera supported with facial tracking software. Facial features were extracted from the video, and the input data was compared against performance output data such as error (i.e. dropped screws, incorrect alignment of part numbers, unfinished wooden boards) and the time it took to finish each wooden board. Using machine learning algorithms, we were able to train and build models that predict behavior and performance. Results show that trained classifiers were able to make predictions and classifications at three levels: 1) Instantaneous errors can be predicted two seconds before they occur with an overall accuracy of 88.7%, 2) Phases of learning and mastery can be classified with an overall accuracy of 66.5%, 3) Overall performance quality of a subject, whether the subject will be a fast learner, and whether the subject will fatigue quickly can be predicted using only the first seven minutes of facial data with respective overall accuracies at 90.9%, 97.7% and 72.7%."

Millions of dollars have been spent on campaign advertising by candidates, parties, and independent groups, which may be the electorates only source of information. These ads often contain cues including information aligning a candidate with a party or group. Relying on a unique combination of a survey/experiment and a natural experiment, this paper examines how state Supreme Court advertisements from the 2007 Pennsylvania Supreme Court election cued an electorate to vote along party lines. Results show that exposure to a candidates ads increases vote for that candidate when the voter is of the same party as the candidate. This relationship is mediated through knowledge gained from the ads."

The encounters of people, places, things and technologies, and their interaction and interpenetration in the city lead to unforeseen constellations and a porosity that allows  and even imposes  juxtapositions of difference. In studying the convergence of different people, ideas and practices in the cosmopolis, we face the inevitable task of redefining difference and the meanings attached to it, especially those that conceptually and methodologically direct us towards binaries, oppositions, and bounded positions. In the city, creativity, communication and conflict are often shaped around the points of contact and in urban transitivity. This paper looks at various occasions where urban dwellers engage in close encounters  especially in their media and communication practices  and asks whether the city reveals possibilities for a definition and a politics of difference, which is not about Otherness, strangeness and suspicion but about co-existence, communication and negotiation."

We routinely distinguish the artificial experiences of game play from the real world that exists outside such computer-generated fantasies. We often differentiate the designer bodies of avatars from the real person who manipulates the digital strings. And when push comes to shove, when things in the virtual environment get confused or exceedingly complicated, we often make reference to and seek to return to the relatively safe and well-defined world of what is now called in a curious recursive gesture ""real reality."" This paper investigates the nature of the real as it is situated in and played with by computer games. The objective is not to engage in mere speculation about the nature of reality but to provide the field of game studies with a more realistic and sophisticated understanding of the real."

In 1960, Hispanics were only 5 percent of Dade Countys population. By the year 2000, they accounted for 57.3 percent of the population, and Cubans remaining a slight majority over other Latino groups. And as the Hispanic population within the United States continues to grow, Miami represents an important case study for understanding how forces working externally and internally to news organizationssweeping demographic change, shifts in political power, transformations in media economics and organizational restructuring, among other hypothesized variablescan affect content. How has The Herald chosen to interpret the issues for its dramatically metamorphosing publics? How has this coverage changed over time, in terms of trends and patterns? What were the critical moments for content change? Superficially, one would expect coverage of issues of import to the nascent Cuban-American community to increase, as that group swelled both in terms of numbers and political power. But the nuances of such change deserve careful examination, something not the subject of previous scholarly research. What was happening within the organization, at the same time massive changes were occurring in the greater Miami area? This paper presents a content analysis of Herald coverage of Cuba, Cubans, and issues of import to the Cuban community, from 1959-2007 in order to present an instance of institutional and organizational transformation that can serve in comparison as other communities continue to experience change."

From a discursive point of view, organizational change is the process of constructing and sharing new meanings and interpretations of organizational activities. It is because these activities are language-dependent that they can be redefined and altered. The aim of this paper is twofold, first to provide a review and critique of the existing literature on discourse and organizational change and to explore developments in the field. Prominent themes and approaches are distinguished and compared. Second, leaders and members discourse on strategic change is analyzed in order to illustrate empirically how actors are constructing the rationale behind strategic change initiatives in tree different business organizations. In a concluding section, the contribution of discourse studies to the literature on communication during organizational change is discussed as well as ensuing advice to practitioners planning, leading and living change."

Specifically, the paper explores how Uyghur leadership in exile organizes political dissent around gendered key symbols and to what effect. Uyghurs are Turkic-speaking groups from northwestern China and one of the official 56 nationalities in China. Due to political problems, Uyghurs have emigrated to countries in Central Asia, in Europe, and North America and have set up several exile organizations, with the World Uyghur Congress being the umbrella organization and Rabiya Kadeers its President. The (re)presentation and positioning of Rebiya Kadeer as Mother of Uyghurs is central to the constitution of a Uyghur diasporic identity. Through an analysis of imposed stereotypes related to minorities in China and Uyghurs in particular as well as websites by Uyghur exile organizations and a personal interview with Rebiya Kadeer, this paper demonstrates the intersections between gender and political advocacy. Overall, the paper illustrates how the leadership of a diasporic group affirmed but also challenged received gender scripts for a political emancipation project."

Matthes and Kohring have recently proposed a method that improves the reliability and validity of media frames. This method attempts to derive categories of analysis from the four functions that Entman assign to a framing: to define a problem, to determine the cause, to make moral judgments and to suggest a solution. In line with their approach, I would like to suggest alternative categories that might be more open to a systematic analysis: actors, labels, actions (verbs), places and related semantic field. Among the words resulting from this analysis, the most significant, in terms of frequency, connotations and interconnection should be selected and organized into meaningful clusters of keywords. These clusters will then be interpreted as frames.
An application of this method is proposed. Finally I briefly discuss the contributions and limits of this study."

In this essay, we configure a taxonomy of definitions and discussions of theory through a cross-disciplinary perspective, by reflecting on the different views on theory in the discipline of communication in the broader context of views on theory at the intersection of social sciences and humanities. We argue that a preeminent tendency, theory as puzzle-solving, with its varieties science and investigation, is based on a subject-object schism, on the preexistence of the object to the subject and the primacy of the object over the subject. We also argue that a counteracting tendency, theory as puzzle-making, with its varieties interpretation and inquiry, is based on a subject-object communion, on the creation of any object by subjects and the dependence of any object on subjects."
2009-0825,Keywords in Interaction: Grammatical and Interactional Projections of Discourse Markers,Top Four Papers From the Language & Social Interaction Division,,,,Paper,Keywords in Interaction: Grammatical and Interactional Projections of Discourse Markers,Top Four Papers From the Language & Social Interaction Division,"The present study investigates the phenomenon of projection in relation to the grammaticization (Hopper 1987) of keywords -- Hebrew discourse markers -- in interaction. It is based on investigation of a variety of Hebrew discourse markers, but here I illustrate only with respect to tov (okay, fine, lit. good).

I show that tov exhibits dialogical grammaticization patterns involving interactional structures which have crystallized into grammatical ones. As a result, interactional projection has come to involve also syntactic projection.

Discourse markers project a particular type of social action -- frame shifting -- which speakers continually engage in throughout interaction, and which speakers often announce, in other words, project. There is a particular type of first parts employed to project frame shifts -- longer metalingual constructions which have often grammaticized into discourse markers (Maschler 2002, in press). I suggest that discourse markers have grammaticized out of such first parts which strongly project other social actions to come.

Discourse markers are shown, then, to be involved in two parallel crystallizations -- one concerned with actions, the other with structure. On the one hand, they comprise a crystallization of an interactional structure into a single move. On the other hand, they comprise a crystallization of a frequently employed metalingual utterance (announcing a particular frame shift) into a fixed utterance (e.g., ze tov it [is] good > tov okay, fine), often involving phenomena of automatization, bonding within the phrase, reduction of form, and semantic loss."
2009-0826,Keywords in the Demonization of Soft Power,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,,,,Paper,Keywords in the Demonization of Soft Power,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,"Towards the end of the twentieth century American sociologist Leon Mayhew impugned public relations as applying persuasion and influence, inexorably altering the shape of public opinion and thus the public sphere. The influence of public relations created a New Public, which, unlike Habermas mythical public of the Enlightenment, was incapable of differentiating real and fabricated information. Consequently, this New Public was unable to form genuine opinions or interpret public policy. Two of Mayhews theories have the capacity to influence post-structural public relations; the rhetoric of presentation and the redemption of tokens of influence. This panel proposal explains Mayhews argument and provides an introduction to the relevance of his work as the field of public relations struggles with the keywords of globalization, regionalization and localization along with its own social relationships to communities, tribes and the news media in the early twenty first century.
In the late twentieth century Leon Mayhew, a U.S. sociologist, set out to prove that public relations1 exerts enormous persuasion and influence upon the mass public of western culture, and that the consequent rationalization erodes the social organization of public opinion (Mayhew, 1997, p. ix). Mayhews New Public is caught up in a modernity surrounded by sociopolitical and economic products and services which it is unable to differentiate, thus placing it in harms way; a position that is manipulated by public relations intent on delivering maximized profits to sociopolitical and economic clients. The communicators most reviled by Mayhew are public relations counsellors, advertisers, and marketers, all representing client-based communication as consumable product, and seeking immunity from any redemption of tokens most often associated with solidarity between client and consumer. By imagining historical mass publics in a particular way, Mayhew at once is able to imagine his own New Public in which mass opinion is cogniscent of the aims and goals of public relations working on behalf of clients, refusing thus to be persuaded and influenced."

The focus of this paper is to examine the perceived usability of Web sites, a key issue related to form and function. Participants viewed nine Web sites representing three vacation locales. Each locale had three versions of a Web site associated with it, each varying in degree of usability. Findings indicated that users didnt always distinguish between visual and content criteria. In terms of visual representations, users most often mentioned colors and graphics (including photos) as elements that draw them to a Web site and encourage use. Furthermore, there was inconsistency with regard to usability. Participants rated the Web sites considered lowest in usability (based on expert ranking utilizing usability literature) as the most usable sites."

More specifically, it is a case study of the well-known browsing saga in Borders Bookstore Singapore, which has been debated in The Straits Times, online, and elsewhere for almost a decade. What triggered the browsing saga at Borders? Why are so many Singaporeans worked up about an act that seems so mundane? The major task of this article is answering these questions. In this pursuit, I consider various explanations for why rogue consumers abused Borders browsing policies. I also analyze three discourses surrounding the browsing saga. Interestingly, all three discourses reveal different types of island-ness anxiety embodied by various social groups in Singapore. At the heart of these anxieties are questions concerning Singapores place in the global world and Singaporeans place in their country."

However, little is known about the specific content of certain television shows and stations that parents find acceptable for their children to view. By drawing on in-depth interviews with parents, this study examined how parents who are actively meditating their childrens television usage determine what is appropriate content for their children to watch and also how they view the other parents who they see as helping create the undesirable media effects on children by not mediating their own childrens television use. A framework is developed for the process each parent may undergo in determining appropriate content for their children. The four main overarching themes (and their underlying factors) for which parents consider when going through the determination process are as follows: (1) characteristics of the child, (2) previous knowledge of the programming, (3) characteristics of the television show, and (4) information from outside influences, such as online blogs or talking with other parents. However, the perception of the influence of television was a prerequisite to how parents then managed these overarching themes. Further implications and limitations are discussed."

Results supported the basic tenets of the CMM, as news surveillance motivation interacted with attention to increase elaboration and therefore learning. Two other variables were tested as potential context-specific replacements for news surveillance: health motivation and cancer worry. Health motivation was unrelated to learning whereas cancer worry and learning had an inverse curvilinear (U-shaped) relationship. Participants with low and high cancer worry faired better on learning questions than their moderate worry counterparts. The results support and extend the CMM as well as validate past research suggesting a connection between attention and cancer information gain."

Just as earlier, parental education interacts with media use to produce knowledge gaps. There are also new gaps created by the in-home presence of new media, and parental political participation. Results are discussed in terms of adolescent socialization processes."

Results showed that the workers did not focus only on gathering resources driven by domain-focused keywords but also needed resources to help them answer situated questions. Results will be analyzed using SMMs analytics as a potential basis for knowledge system design. It is assumed that results can inform and inspire the design of more user-oriented knowledge management systems."

Since 2006, ERMs global knowledge sharing program and practices have been informed by Dervins Sense-Making Methodology (SMM). SMM has guided ERM leaders to review initial assumptions about knowledge and knowledge transfer defined as focusing on expert knowledge or best practices to include two-way exchange of ideas, experience, insights, comments, and work examples. With SMM in mind, ERM has introduced online tools (e.g., blogs, wikis) on its knowledge sharing platform. This paper shares a case study of how SMM has informed the design of a Safety Moment Blog  a critical tool to promote a safety culture for all employees  and discusses in what way SMM has been applied and could be better applied to avoid pretend dialogue and build common understanding among 3500 employees."
2009-0834,"Knowledge Management Technology, Information Visibility, and the Social Construction of Expertise",Organizational Communication Technology and Knowledge Management: Multiple Approaches,,,,Paper,"Knowledge Management Technology, Information Visibility, and the Social Construction of Expertise",Organizational Communication Technology and Knowledge Management: Multiple Approaches,"This paper advances the perspective that when new technologies make information about who knows what visible to team members for whom it was once invisible, a forum is created in which expertise is socially constructed and strategically reformulated by reflexive actors. To illustrate this perspective, we draw on data from an ethnographic study of computer technicians who contributed information to a knowledge management system known as an Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) technology. Our findings show that when technicians who had not previously worked together were organized into a functional team, knowledge about who knew what remained invisible due to decisions made about how to divide and assign work. When technicians began to enter information about their jobs into the newly implemented ITSM, this information became, for the first time, easily visible for all other team members. This visible information was used as a proxy for people to make attributions about who was an expert, and experts were continually assigned more jobs of the kinds similar to the ones they documented in the technology. However, most technicians did not want to be known as experts in the areas to which others were attributing them expertise, so they began to game the system by entering information into the ITSM that would help them to be seen as experts in areas they wanted to claim expertise. We discuss implications of these findings for theory about technology-enabled knowledge sharing in organizations."
2009-0835,Knowledge Sharing Errors in Groups,Communication and Organizational Knowledge: Issues for Theory and Practice,,,,Paper,Knowledge Sharing Errors in Groups,Communication and Organizational Knowledge: Issues for Theory and Practice,"Working in groups can be difficult. Group members must decide who knows what, coordinate who will do what, share knowledge and accomplish their individual and collective tasks. Research indicates that groups do not often handle these tasks as well as they should, and as a result, almost always perform worse than what would be expected based on the sum of all members' individual knowledge and abilities. This presentation explores the sources, processes and outcomes of knowledge sharing-related process losses in groups. We will present a conceptual framework for understanding knowledge sharing errors in groups that builds on previous research on group cognition and transactive memory, and will use the framework to discuss the steps that groups can take to reduce the likelihood of knowledge sharing errors."

One of the most entrenched news routines, the inverted pyramid, continues to persist in both print and online news. This study explored the cognitive processing and subjective evaluation of written news when structured either as an inverted pyramid or a chronological presentation. In a 2 (structure) x 2 (story) mixed design, participants read two inverted pyramid and two chronological news stories, each on a different topic. Dependent measures included availability of cognitive resources while reading, cued recall, recognition accuracy and text comprehension. Secondary task reaction times (STRTs), which measure attention and use of cognitive resources, were slower for chronological stories, possibly because they require more construction of meaning than inverted pyramid stories. A marginally significant difference favoring the inverted pyramid structure was observed on the text comprehension measure. These results are discussed in the context of potential new interpretations of STRT for text messages, which likely involve more effortful processing than broadcast messages, the common stimuli in most media experiments."

New Keywords for Understanding Cross-Cultural Success and Failure of Media Content,Local-Global Tensions in News and Entertainment,"This paper addresses the question of when and how cultural differences between media producers and audiences negatively influence the success of media exports. It proposes the Lacuna and Universal Model that provides a terminology and a theoretical classification of various phenomena, explaining why particular media content may or may not be appreciated internationally. It puts forward the term Lacuna for possible reasons for the cross-cultural failure of media content, and it argues that media content is not successful with audiences outside its culture of production when audiences perceive a mismatch between their own cultural baggage and that of the producer. Depending on what elements of the cultural baggage do not match, this paper introduces the terms Content Lacuna, Capital Lacuna, and Production Lacuna. Furthermore, it puts forward the term Universal for possible reasons for the international success of media content. Specifically, it proposes the terms Content Universal, Audience Created Universal, and Company Created Universal for content attributes or circumstances as a result of which content is successful despite possible cultural differences. For each category of Lacuna and Universal, this paper provides examples that have been identified through in-depth interviews with representatives of some of the largest western media companies and their Asian subsidiaries and affiliates. Interviewees were asked to describe why they thought certain western media was or was not successful with audiences in China, India, and Japan. The analysis of the interviews also allows for a comparison across countries and media types with regard to cultural barriers."

This line of research has been predominantly conducted in Western cultures, especially in the United States, indicating that older adults are underrepresented, marginalized, or stereotypically portrayed in television programming. This pattern of negative characterizations has been further explored cross-culturally, especially in cultures where an explicit age related cultural value of filial piety or elder respect is upheld. New data will be presented revealing similar patterns of negative stereotyping of older adults in the Western cultural context."

There is little research on how such representations are communicatively constructed. In this keyword presentation we discuss some possibilities for how interpersonal communication defines, diffuses, and perpetuates social identities. We will present data from interactive mixed-sex dyads who discussed controversial issues, later ranked one another on influence, and rated one another on status. Research suggests that low status people are more likely to use first-person singular pronouns (I, me) than high status people. We will use the actor-partner interdependence model to test whether: 1) pronoun use is associated with status in dyads, 2) whether the use of these words is interdependent such that the more one actor uses personal pronouns, the less the partner uses, 3) whether this interdependence accounts for status distinctions, and finally 4) whether personal pronoun use is independent of tentative language."

Communication scholars use the SEM in different approaches, which possibly result in contradicting outcomes in estimating structural relationships between variables. Since different approaches may lead to different conclusions about the same model with the same data, it is necessary to acknowledge the influence of SEM techniques on the results of analyses. Thus, the current study aims to examine how the SEM techniques are differentiated and whether and how these techniques affect the results of analyses. Its findings suggest that the two-step latent composite modeling provides more efficiency in estimating structural models than the hybrid approaches and more reliability of scales than the one-step modeling by separating measurement issues from the estimation of relationships between constructs."

Through a social support framework, the author explores what types of support messages are expressed by the forums users and how these messages may contribute to the development of social capital. Univision Online caters to Latinos, and Spanish-dominant Latinos in particular; therefore this study describes how Latino Internet users are engaging in computer-mediated communication (CMC) within a very specific online community. Immigration-related social support messages expressed in the immigration forum can contribute to community building and the development of migrant-specific social capital. The resource and information sharing occurring within Univision Online is an example of a powerful, and often ignored, strand in the fabric of social relations that can influence migration and mobilization among Latino immigrants. Latinos currently access the Internet less than other ethnic groups, but high levels of engagement with the Univision Online portal may signify a growing interest in CMC among this population."

It draws upon interviews with participants, memoirs, archival documents, and news media content. It argues that debates about the CNN Effect are useful for refocusing research efforts on the relationships between mass media, government policy, and foreign affairs, but that to appreciate these relationships the scope of media analysis and types of effects must be broadened. Western media coverage, including but not limited to television, may have had a greater impact on the Latvian independence movement it covered than US or Western foreign policy. The paper addresses the limitations of the CNN Effect thesis, examines the character of Western media coverage of Latvia, looks at media and Western foreign policy, and finally examines Latvian concern for Western media and efforts to address foreign audiences through mass media."

Discourse analysis was used to analyze interviews of sixteen individuals involved in the creation of this center. Five dominant Discourses emerged: autonomy, relatedness, self-awareness, communication as a skill, and the leader as a visionary. These both echo and differ from the findings of Allan and colleagues (2006). The implications of these Discourses are discussed as are notable discursive absences. The research offers alternative perspectives on the discursive construction of academic leadership specifically and leadership more generally. Directions for future research are offered."

2009-0845,Learning by Doing and the Heresy of Building Trust,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,,,,Paper,Learning by Doing and the Heresy of Building Trust,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,"Building trust has become a central area of interest for public relations (Ledingham & Bruning, 1998; Rawlins, 2006; Moloney 2005; Bentele, 2005), yet little discussion has been carried out over how public relations professionals can actually do this suggested building. Especially in cases where the relationship between an organization and its stakeholders has not been well maintained or suffers from misunderstanding, building trust seems impossible. Though many public relations practitioners seem to know how trust can be created in practice, we are lacking theories describing the forces at play and the process of trust formation.
Social theorists and political scientists have spent many decades pondering the formation of trust, and the paper suggests that public relations could learn from them. Those social theorists with empirical data on the topic could contribute best. Putnam and Nanellis (1993) case study on different decades of trust formation in Italy shed light on how trust is formed and what prohibits it from forming. They suggest that what matters is not how people feel in general, but what they do over and over again. They emphasized the importance of collaboration: a weak and un-civic-minded society would only foster a corrupt government and lead to a cycle of poverty and distrust, whereas a society with strong civic traditions and a participating population contributed to high generalized trust and made government as well as economy successful. The secret lay in the social networks that generalized trust and trustworthiness among people.
Contrary to the idea of building trust, Putnam saw trust as a by-product of collaboration. In fact, where the aim is to build trust, the opposite may result. Clubs and associations served as learning grounds for democracy; the social networks formed in associations generalized trust across society at large (Putnam & Nanetti, 1993). In a way what he described was learning by doing: building a relationship of trust required personal involvement and collaboration, and building trust was not possible without being involved in the actual exchange."

Their characteristics affect regulatory outcomes and understanding these regulatory organizations adds to our knowledge about the way media regulation works. Yet the structures and procedures of press councils as well as their relationship to environments mark a largely unexplored subject. Based on new institutionalism in organization theory, this paper examines the way press councils respond to their institutional environments. For this paper I compared four European press councils by performing a qualitative analysis of internal documents and qualitative interviews. Results indicate that press councils are not determined by their institutional environments but are able to strategically respond to them and thus to manage their legitimacy. While press councils conform to the cultural-cognitive pillar of institutions, they respond with a broad range of strategies to regulative pressures and normative expectations."

Given the role of state ideological apparatus, the Peoples Daily has assumed its responsibility in the very process of attempting to legitimate a social order. A content analysis of the peasant narratives in this party organ from 1997 to 2006 reveals that its peasant narratives show a remarkable consistency with the official policy agenda and three cores ruptures underlying this rural transition are discernibleproduct surplus, peasant burden and land use. A discourse analysis further identifies the dominant ideological packages underneath its portrayal of three key subgroups in this rural transitiona benevolent government, village cadres as altruistic patriarchs and the upstarts characterized by an exclusive reliance on technology. By reducing, essentializing and fixing these images, the party organ operates to symbolically fix boundaries and maintain the symbolic order with a view to consensus-building and state legitimation."

Indian womanhood has been transformed in media narratives from a coy and submissive persona to a bold assertive, and sexualized/eroticized personality after the globalization and liberalization of Indian economy. This research reflects on how audiences (especially members of religious minority communities) interact with media messages that diametrically opose their values and culture. The author seeks to understand how young women balance the tension between media messages and their religious ideology and how does this struggle inform their identity and aspirations for the future. This research proposes that interacoins between media narratives and identity of young Muslim women should be seen within the context of rising consumerism and job insecurity in transformed Indian economy."

This presentation traces the rise of that belief and argues for a new historical analysis of the politics of attention. The talk returns first to the 1930s, where it outlines the ubiquitous fear that mass media might create the sort of mass men then coming to power in Nazi Germany. Such fears depended on a Freudian model of the self and a sender-message-receiver model of communication. The presentation then shows how Bauhaus refugees working in New York and Chicago drew on Gestalt psychology to develop an immersive, multi-screen aesthetic that they hoped would help create democratic personalities. The talk concludes by arguing that this turn represents a tap root of contemporary multimedia aesthetics and a powerful lens with which to explore the politics of attention today."

Simpson murder trial, and the potential inaccuracy of audience measurement systems. Drawing on trade and business press coverage, as well as analyses of broadcast and online texts, I consider how network decision makers and the soaps creative staffs have struggled to revitalize the soap genre across this period. In particular, I explore changes in storytelling, casting, production models, and transmedia distribution and promotion to analyze how these programs and their viewers have responded to the genres imperiled state. Ultimately, I argue that just as no one cause explains the declines in the soaps popularity neither will a single new effort be able to reinvigorate this once immensely popular form."
2009-0852,"Liminalities, Borders, Bodies: Gay Identities And Representational Strategies In Contemporary Spain.",Global Sexualities,,,,Extended Abstract,"Liminalities, Borders, Bodies: Gay Identities And Representational Strategies In Contemporary Spain.",Global Sexualities,"This paper aims to analyse how social-cultural discourses are inscribed in and transformed by our bodies and our body practices, and how discourses on hegemony and resistance become embodied and politic. Bodies, as locus where discourses and counterdiscourses cross and are inscribed, are also dynamic instances where personal itineraries (Esteban, 2004) and particular narratives are developed. In particular, through bodies we aim to analyse etic and emic social discourses on such aspects as sexual and gender dimorphism, identities, sexual practice and desire, sexual dissidence, power, ideology and transgression. By considering intersections between bodies, ideology, sexuality, identity, gender and consumption, we want to provide a critical approach to the historical and cultural conformation of the sex/gender/ sexual practice system and approach the body from a personal, a social and a political perspective. We will also take into account the processes of commodification of bodies.

The analysis, based in intensive fieldwork carried out in three Spanish cities, of explicitly sexualized places basically the gay scene- and the representational strategies displayed in the Spanish Gay Parades (identity politics) are privileged fields for studying how, parting from the so-called sexual orientation, personal and social identities are and have historically been- deeply embodied. Bodies then become frontiers, limits, symbolic locus that incorporate complex identities and discursive practices, personal and political. Identities and discourses that refer us to fundamental classificatory categories such as sex, gender, identity, sexuality."

While his initial writing on the Lippmann-Dewey exchange was insightful, over time he came to a position that interpreted Lippmann as an anti-democrat rather than--as this paper argues the Lippmann texts clearly indicate--a subtle thinker concerned with how to integrate expertise into a functioning democracy. The paper ends with speculation about what it was about the political and cultural climate of the 80s that may have led Carey to his misreading."

At the same time, they frequently engage in risky sexual behavior, which makes them vulnerable to HIV/STDs infection. To be able to design culturally appropriate health promoting interventions, more knowledge about the factors that influence their sexual behavior is needed. Therefore, this paper reports on a qualitative study that aims to increase our understandings of the influences on Turkish and Moroccan adolescent male sexuality within a broader interest in HIV/STD prevention. Seven focus groups with 29 Moroccan and 20 Turkish boys, aged between 14 and 18 years, were conducted. Analysis of the data highlighted several factors that may hinder condom use, such as lack of knowledge, lack of perceived risk, peer norms, lack of parent-adolescent communication about sexuality, and lack of self-efficacy toward buying condoms. Results also show some significant differences between the Turkish and Moroccan study participants. Turkish adolescents are more conservative toward sexuality, they stick more strongly to cultural traditions and they have less knowledge about HIV/STDs than Moroccan adolescents. Moroccan adolescents experiment more frequently with sex. Therefore, they may be at higher risk of getting infected with HIV/STDs. The findings of our study provide a fertile starting point for designing culturally appropriate and effective health education programs in the field of safe sex promotion for ethnic minority adolescents."

This gap is addressed with a three component communication framework: interaction-focused reasoning about a future with diabetes, unwillingness to talk about diabetes, and the supportive communication practices of person-centeredness and mutual learning. Individuals (n=175) with Types 1 or 2 diabetes completed a questionnaire on their conversations about diabetes. Two forms of reasoning were related to diabetes outcomes; reasoning that self-care could influence complications and that complications are inevitable predicted diabetes distress, empowerment, and life satisfaction. Fear of disclosure and supportive communication practices also predicted these diabetes outcomes, with all communication components accounting for 15-21% of the variance in diabetes outcomes. The findings show the relevance of particular communication practices for diabetes self-management."

Using data gathered from 18,484 respondents spread among 27 metro areas large and small, this study examined key distinctions between online-only newspaper readers and those who read both print and online. We found that hybrid users were more satisfied with their local newspapers Web sites, and used them more purposefully to seek everyday information. For practitioners as well as media researchers, these findings raise new questions about the perceived utility of online news sites, the economics of local newspaper readership, and the active nature of seemingly passive traditional media users."

In this paper I present the results of ethnographic interviews and participant observations made in Nairobi in 2007-2008 with the aim to map and describe practices of production of news imagery mainly from a photographers point-of-view. As international photo agencies (AP, AFP, Reuters and others) are part of todays large media conglomerates, the photographers working for them can be seen as important agents of cultural globalization, forging links between here and there, allowing readers to sit comfortably at their kitchen tables or at their computer reading the news while experiencing being there at least in some sense. But the same is also true for more locally based photographers, who are also involved in managing meaning across varying social and geographical spaces. The research project examines the organizational contexts within which professional photojournalists work, touching upon the institutions as well as the distribution system, and key agents managing and controlling access to that system. By centering the research on media production in Africa, it has the potential to investigate both local and international relations in todays increasingly (but unevenly) global media system."

In the mobile city game Frequency 1550 teams -of four students each- step into the games world. With help of the Internet, smart phones and GPS technology, Amsterdam changes into a medieval playground, the year 1550. Results of an analysis of the game as a narrative environment show that the game evokes a mixture of receiving (spectator), constructing (director) and participating in (actor) the story of medieval Amsterdam. Moreover, evaluation of the learning effects reveals that students who played Frequency 1550 acquired significantly more historical knowledge than the students who attended a regular lesson series. A newly designed mobile gaming and learning platform (Games Atelier) is presented, which is based on the technology and the evaluation of Frequency 1550."

Locative technologies have been described as being primarily aleatory, however we argue that they may serve the opposite purpose, causing people to navigate the cityand their social relationsmore intentionally. Based on Simmels theory of sociability, we argue that a critical social component of navigating through the city is managing interactions (potential and actual) with other citizens. We argue that such technologies contribute to the management of interactions (by helping us avoid some or seek out others), therefore mitigating the aleatory effects of navigating an urban environment: Those aleatory effects that include the potential for casual, random encounters and meetings. Therefore, through existing examples of LBMGs, we suggest that these ICTs potentially promote increased social management and might limit social interaction."

The converging technologies and markets that make this possible present a major regulatory quandary, because national regulatory authorities seek to maintain mutual exclusivity between regulated telecommunications services and largely unregulated information services.

Many emerging services do not easily fit into one or the other regulatory classification, nor can the Federal Communications Commission determine the appropriate classification by extrapolating from the regulatory model applied to existing or discontinued services. By failing to specify what model applies to services appearing on cellphone screens, the FCC has failed to remove regulatory uncertainty. Cellular telephone service providers may infer that any convergent service eventually will qualify for the unregulated information service safe harbor despite plausible arguments that government oversight remains essential to achieve consumer protection, fair trade, and other safeguards.

This paper will examine the regulatory status of wireless carrier-delivered video content with an eye toward determining the necessary scope and nature of government oversight. The paper reports on instances where the FCC deemed it necessary to promote video programming competition and subscriber access to wired cable television content, and concludes that wireless subscribers deserve similar efforts in light of wireless carriers incentives and abilities to blunt competition. The paper concludes that NRAs must balance the carriers interests in finding new revenue centers to pay for next generation network upgrades with subscribers interests in maximizing their freedom to use handsets they own."

This study showed that individuals who were lonely or did not have good social skills could develop strong compulsive Internet use behaviors and end up running into negative life outcomes (e.g., harming other significant activities such as work, classes, or significant relationships), instead of relieving their original problems. Such augmented negative outcomes were expected to isolate individuals from healthy social activities and lead them into more loneliness. Even though previous research suggested that social use of the Internet (i.e., social networking sites and instant messaging) could be more problematic than entertainment use (i.e. downloading files), the current study showed that the former did not show stronger associations in the key paths leading to compulsive Internet use than the latter."
2009-0862,Lonely adopters?: An exploratory study of early adopters of mobile television and their mobile phone appropriation,Mobile2.0: Beyond Voice?,,,,Paper,Lonely adopters?: An exploratory study of early adopters of mobile television and their mobile phone appropriation,Mobile2.0: Beyond Voice?,"Combining two of the most successful media technologies in 20th century, mobile television was long considered as a predetermined success, and its breakthrough attended at the latest for the Olympic Games 2008. Instead, observers witnessed repeated launch failures. While these have been dismissed as either ongoing technological problems or strategic quarrels between supply-side actors, suspicion arises whether the real problem is not a lack of demand.
To give a user-sided perspective on how the innovation may finally get out of the starting blocks, our study turns to the early adopters of mobile TV  supposedly the gatekeepers of innovation. Who are these forerunners without followers? How have they integrated the innovation into the routines and places of their everyday life? Which social and symbolical meanings do they attribute to it and how do they communicate it to their environment?
These questions are considered within the framework of an integrative appropriation model, based on approaches from an adoption-oriented perspective (Theory of Planned Behavior, Technology Acceptance Model, Diffusion Theory) and from an appropriation-oriented background (Frame analysis, Domestication research, Uses-and-Gratifications). It permits considering individual users mobile TV appropriation in the larger context of their appropriation of the mobile telephone and of their classical television use. It has been operationalized to a standardized scale of mobile phone appropriation.
To get a representative picture of the early adopters, we have realized a telephone survey in Germany in may 2007 among a randomized sample of 1.001 users of the mobile TV offer proposed by the network operator Vodafone (based on 3G transmission).
The sample partially conforms to the classical image of opinion leaders  young and financially well-off  but diverges namely with a low educational level. Despite assessing themselves as opinion leaders, they lament problems in communicating the innovation to their environment, which keeps qualifying it as an irrelevant gimmick.
A cluster analysis reveals a rather heterogeneous appropriation between five groups: The information junkies (n=126) who mainly use mobile TV to stay informed  even for distraction  and limit their use on news channels. The always connected (n=173), whose motive is a fear to miss important events, but how strongly reject using mobile TV for diversion. The members of the third cluster (n=155) are entertainment seekers, most likely to watch fictional programs and to watch in company of others. Finally, the all-rounders (n=214) use mobile TV for all of the mentioned reasons and excel by their use of traditional TV. The fifth cluster (n=189) consists of sparse users  watching traditional TV to the lowest extend.
In summary, the early adopters of mobile TV appear as little innovative: Not only are the determining motives very close to those of classical TV, but the amount of classical TV use also appears as a good predictor for mobile TV use intensity. To convince future adopters, the innovation may have to be geared towards more innovative and interactive uses of audiovisual media as known from the Internet, and away from old-fashioned TV."

Stigma, identity negotiation, and disclosure are connoted differently in various disciplines. This paper examines how communication research constructs and uses these ideas uniquely. Stigma and disclosure have been defined in  amongst other disciplines  performance studies, social psychology, sociology, psychology, and public health literature. Mostly, these concepts are reduced to abstract, individualistic, or limited terms. Stigma, for instance, is rarely seen as a social barrier with material implications: it is personal and, as such, can be overcome by the individual. Further, constructs such as racial background, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status become implicitly imbedded in this term. Disclosure is drastically reduced in scope to verbal means. In communication research, stigma is understood as a social construction that impacts disclosure and identity negotiation. Often, as communication researchers, this nuance holds powerful implications for the populations and processes studied. In the case of HIV-positive individuals, the role of stigma and the choice and process of disclosure are integral parts of identity negotiation in interpersonal and health communication."

Hoggart. From 1971 to 1980 Tracey was at the Centre for Mass
Communication Research at Leicester, first as a doctoral student and
then as a Research Fellow. It was the heyday of the Centre, with the
likes of Murdock, Golding, Croll, Hartman, Cumberbatch, Elliot,
McCron. It was here, also, that he began working with David Morrison.

It was, he suggests, a seminal moment from which much could be
learned, both in terms of theorizing media and society, but also
about the stuff of developing research. It was this latter lesson
which he took to the Broadcasting research Unit which he was asked to
start in 1981. The BRU began life sharing a room with a guy doing
press cuttings, but grew into what was easily the most visible media
research think tank in Britain. At the BRU Tracey worked closely with
Richard Hoggart, Chairman of the BRU. He was also fortunate to have
working at the BRU a small but extremely gifted group researchers
such as David Morrison, David Docherty, Stephen Barnett and Manuel
Alvarado.
Between 1971 and 1988, when he went to the University of Colorado, he
had the privilege, sometimes bruising but always fascinating, of
working to, and learning from, the most important figure in mass
communications research in Britain, Jim Halloran, and the most
prominent public intellectual of his time, Richard Hoggart. He
wishes he could do it all over again."

Several hypotheses regarding the importance of gender and relationships were tested by combining a large survey dataset with unobtrusive behavioral data from a year of play. Consistent with expectations, males played for achievement-oriented reasons and were more aggressive, especially within romantic relationships where both partners played. Female players in such relationships had higher general life happiness than their male counterparts. Female players were more likely to play for social reasons. Contrary to popular stereotypes and current hypotheses, it was the female players who played the most. Female players were also healthier than male players or females in the general population. The several findings have implications for gender theory and communication-oriented methods in games and online researchmost notably for the use of self-reported time spent, which was systematically incorrect and different by gender."

The MEDIAPPRO survey of 11 to 18 year-old pupils, carried out in eight European countries (including Estonia) in autumn 2005, various sources from the EU Kids Online Data Repository and the data of a questionnaire survey of 11 to 18 year-old pupils, carried out in comprehensive schools in three cities of Estonia in autumn 2007 (N=713) provide the empirical basis for analysing the extent of pupils engagement in creative online activities. The findings allow postulating that online content creation is more frequently practiced in countries with a high and even Internet usage across different socio-demographic groups. Activeness in producing content online is related to childrens age, computer and Internet skills as well as mediation and support by peers. Estonia is an exceptional country in Europe due to the combination of high Internet usage and only a mediocre level of content creation by children."

Abstract
Given the prevalence of video in digital media, using algorithms to analyze facial expressions in real-time is inevitable. Previously, scholars have relied on human coders to measure observable movements on the face and intrusive devices such as electromyograms to detect latent muscular movements. Recent advances in computer vision software has demonstrated that automatic facial analysis using computer vision is cost effective, unobtrusive, robust, and accurate as an alternative to human coders. This technology also enables the detection of subtle and dynamic micro-movements which may otherwise have been missed by the human eye. In this talk, we review previous work using facial movements to predict mental states. Moreover we present data from four new experiments: predicting emotion, intent to purchase products, fatigue errors, and poor driving behavior. We discuss implications for theoretical models of emotions and the implications of predicting behaviors using computer vision."

At the same time, politicians allegedly receive less attention and are more often depicted in a valenced way. Furthermore, those commentating on politicians' actions are supposedly predominantly conservative. Analysing data from a content analysis of 4,592 news stories from news coverage of five Danish national elections, this study investigates whether the assumed changes do take place. Journalists and media pundits today appear more often on camera and politicians less often. Finally, media pundits more often have a conservative than a liberal political background. However, these trends are not linear. Possible reasons for the dynamics and effects on the public are discussed."

Transportation, Empathy, and Self-Thoughts",Narrative Persuasion,"Two recent developments in psychology have refocused communication research attention on how empathy and affect come into play in our understanding of media audiences: Transportation and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Transportation and the IRI both include a mix of perspective-taking, fantasy imagining, and the tendency to put ourselves in others places.
The present study explores how transportation and empathy are related by examining the relationship between transportation and empathy. We analyze audience members thoughts in reaction to media content, and how those thoughts relate to those characteristics which are considered to be the defining characteristics of transportation and empathy so that we can map how self-thoughts relate to transportation and empathy."

Trust becomes a key concept, when organizations aim to deal with public displays of emotion. The paper suggests that publics with negative emotions and distrust toward the organization can be described as hateholders, whereas those feeling trust and even love could be described as faith-holders. These emotional publics may arise around specific issues and be of short duration, yet even short protest and proclamations may become significant when such communication is stored for good in the virtual collective memory, the internet: whereas demonstrations, boycotts and outbursts 10 years ago often were covered in the news as mere sound bites, modern technology has turned this around by making information more permanent. Even rumors and hearsay may hinder organizational reputation and even stock value, as they spread around in the virtual arena. Search engines may bring up old controversies and present extreme points of view or even untrue reports at par with factual information. To conclude, the paper proposes the concepts of faith-holder and hateholder to describe the new kinds of relationships organizations today face, and discusses how organizations should navigate the changing waters of stakeholder emotions."

Ted Haggard, then President of National Association of Evangelicals, disclosed his near life-long struggle with same-sex attraction. This public event gave momentary visibility to men and women who lie at the periphery of both American and Christian cultures, namely gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals who self-identify as evangelical Christians. While evangelical spirituality grounds the identity of some Christian believers, it has also fostered their alienation within these communities because of their sexuality. This paper presents results of a phenomenological study centered on tensions between consciousness as a person of faith (Christian identity) and the expression of that identity in spiritual contexts (Christian community). Through in-depth interviews, I attempt to identify (a) tensions LGBT evangelical Christians experience/identify between their faith and sexuality, (b) challenges they experience in expressing identity within their faith traditions and/or communities, and (c) ways participants negotiate spiritual identity and community in light of these tensions."

The analysis focuses on the social discourses embedded in the representations and how they contribute to establish what is acceptable from powerful women."

On that occasion, Magnum Photos sent out twelve of its member photographers to document each of the Eastern and Southern European countries that had been granted access into the EU. The outcome was Euro Visions, a traveling exhibition which traveled across Europe and was actively inscribed in the political celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome that took place in Brussels in 2007. As a world-leading institution and brand of visual production, Magnum Photos is implicated in the development and circulation of globalizing and increasingly generic styles of visual communication. In Euro Visions, this reliance on genericity was especially evident in regard to some of the key visual resources  which I termed typing and juxtaposition  that the photographers used to portray countries of which they had very little prior knowledge. With ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews at the Warsaw and Brussels exhibitions and at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, as well as a semiotic analysis of the exhibitions images and arrangements, this presentation offers a critical perspective on the ways in which Magnum Photos contributes to (re)producing key  generic and, hence, problematic  resources for the transnational visual communication of cultural identities."

However, it is not fully justified to assert that minorities' usage of nonmainstream news sources may result in a divided society without first finding out more about why they turn away from mainstream news sources. This exploratory study examines the factors underlying Singapore Muslims use of nonmainstream news sources. Focus groups revealed that media skepticism, identification with Muslim community, perceived insufficient coverage and desired news perspective are possible reasons why Singaporean Muslims turn to nonmainstream news. A follow-up national CATI found that only identification with Muslim community and total number of news sources used significantly predicted the use of nonmainstream news. Interestingly, greater identification with Muslim community was associated with greater use of mainstream news sources and lower use of nonmainstream media. The implications of the findings are discussed."

These studies have also paid less attention to the cross-cultural perspective of social networking sites than they did on the single cultural base.
This paper explores MySpace and Cyworld in terms of cross-cultural aspects of media management by analyzing annual reports of each company and trade journals. Each of them is a representative social networking site in the US or South Korea, and each is owned by Big Money. Consequently Cyworld and MySpace make profits differently by reflecting their respective cultural backgrounds and have acted as digital centerpieces to create synergy with other subsidiary companies."

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending is a new online alternative to requesting and receiving loans, providing a natural experiment for examining how language can be used in an online environment to persuade and build trust. We examined how the language in 9,695 loan requests at P2P lending site Prosper.com affected lending behavior. Although borrowers often provide justifications or humanizing personal details these verbal indicators did not increase funding by lenders. Instead, word count, quantifiers and prepositions significantly predicted increased loan success. The results are discussed in terms of Elaboration Likelihood Model and Uncertainty Reduction Theory, and practices on how borrowers can optimize the persuasiveness of self-presentations in these contexts are presented."

This paper examines the autonomy of journalistic practice subject to the dual structure of the journalistic field by presenting a case study of the Southern Metro Daily, one of the most famous Chinese papers for its audacity and wisdom of speaking for the underprivileged through investigative journalism.

Using a nationally representative telephone survey of 1,015 adults conducted in 2007, findings from structural equation modeling analysis indicate that mass media attention has direct and indirect effects on public perception of nanotechnology, as mediated by elaborative processing and interpersonal discussion of scientific issues. This suggests that thinking about news and integrating information from diverse others promote better understanding of the scientific world and may provide a more sophisticated cognitive structure for public to form opinion about nanotechnology than factual scientific knowledge. This study also reveals an informational pathway and a heuristic pathway through which the mass media directly and indirectly exert its influence on public perceptions of nanotechnology."

In this paper, we explore whether such effects may be viewed more clearly through the lens of partisan heuristics, or information shortcuts enabled by the association of particular comedy sources with certain perspectives on American politics. Specifically, we test hypotheses concerning whether message-consistent persuasive effects from exposure to a political comedy stimulus taken from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart are moderated by viewers partisan identification. Our results, based on laboratory experimental data (N=323), are consistent with the notion that in cognitive terms: comedians such as Jon Stewart can provide source cues similar to those associated with more traditional political figures and pundits. In other words, they suggest that comedy programs like The Daily Show can help viewers form opinions consistent with their partisan predispositions and thus make sense of the political world. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for research on the effects of political comedy on attitudes and opinion formation, as well as on political knowledge and learning."

Traditionally, sweeping contracts that spread risks across a range of musical products and categories have been used to addresses the uncertainties of lawsuits, international music norms, emerging technologies, sales, and artist maturation. This paper will argue that by positioning televisual texts as their primary products, music industry stakeholders are better able to negotiate these discursive factors. Examining the international implications of this development, this paper will explore how reality music television texts operate as constructs that both limit and distort the realities of musical careers in favor of the export of cultural norms and the stabilizing of industrial brands. Also considered, will be ways that this process may constrain the potential of cultural products as a space for cross-cultural, and revolutionary expression."

Efforts to mitigate community risks are drawn from a number of organizational stakeholders ranging from emergency managers, non-governmental organizations (NGOS), and private enterprise. A consistent challenge among these risk communities is the perplexity of managing knowledge at multiple levels (personal, organizational, but especially at the system or inter-organizational level). It is at this level where risk management requires exceptional effort from participating stakeholders, especially in overcoming tendencies toward territoriality and knowledge as a propriety resource. This paper explores a community-community infrastructure model that delineates processes of inter-organizational collaboration of risk management organizations. Based on perspectives of social informatics, knowledge ecologies, and communities of practice, and influenced by theories grounded in resource dependency and boundary spanning, this paper intends to offer a different viewpoint for how organizations can collaborate to manage knowledge about risks and crises."

These Location Based Services (LBS) are a prime example of the direction that mobility is taking (Nokia, 2008). Bennett and Crowe (2005), in a report to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, address LBS privacy and policy implications, but note that the kind of convergence necessary to arouse concern about the surveillance potential for children, mobile workers and citizens was only just beginning. In three short years, from this report until today, with Nokias N-Gage, Apples iPhone, and RIMs Blackberry, the frontier of convergence of mobile technologies, tracking software, organizational systems, standards setting and public policy is upon us. At a time when proponents and critics suggest that LBS technologies are on the brink of ubiquity via integration with cell phones and other hand-held devices, not only is it crucial that academics take up this kind of data mobility, but also that there is a more general public engagement with the social, ethical, and legal dimensions of LBS. There is, in fact, a politics of mobile data.
The aim of this paper is to critically engage with the convergence of mobile telephony with location-based services, in order to tease out the complexity of this relationship, and its potential for altering the telecommunications landscape in Canada. Using case studies of two of Canadas largest wireless carriers offering LBS services, Bell Canada and Rogers, I focus on the concept of mobility and the simultanaety of fixity and flow. This work not only highlights the politics of mobile data, but also contributes more generally to theorizing mobility within communications studies. Mobility has been taken up extensively within sociology and geography, and while communications has focused on mobile devices, the focus tends to be on the device and the user, rather than on the movement itself. This paper thus helps fill this gap in the literature."

Although the 1990s version shared some similarities with its antecedents it differed from them in important ways too. In terms of commonalties the popularity and success of Riverdance and Irishness in general tapped into long standing correlations of the Irish with authentic folk traditions (however ill defined these concepts might be). That Irishness remains equated with these ideas is remarkable considering the Celtic Tiger changes during the past two and a half decades that transformed Ireland from a traditional agrarian to a high tech urban culture. Despite these dramatic changes Irish music and dance in the 1990s were seen as key routes through which white Americans in particular could tap into these authentic folk experiences. This Irish music and dance craze extends well beyond the US of course to far-flung places throughout the world. However the US variant contains an element absent in global versions, that is, a close connection to whiteness in particular and race in general as Irish operates as not always subtle code for white in a culture perpetually preoccupied with issues of race. By exploring the racial implications of Riverdance and the broader cultural resurgence of Irishness in the US during the 1990s one can begin to trace the initial stages of a new chapter in a much older American story, one in which issues of identity and race dominate."

At the same time, research has shown that news media organizations are highly dependent on official political actors for the construction of news. The purpose of this study is to analyze the nature of official dominance and manifestations of news media independence in routine political press coverage in Sweden. Building upon three related theories of news media behavior  the indexing hypotheses, the dynamics of event-driven news, and the rule of product substitution  a set of hypotheses is derived and tested using a content analysis of 835 news stories published in Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet during a 15-week period in 2008. While official actors dominate news coverage both in terms of source use and story initiation, evidence for a rule of product substitution is found."
2009-0886,Marking the Division of Labor: Division of Meanings in Organizational Groups,tergroup Communication in Organizations and Institutions (Age and Aging),,,,Paper,Marking the Division of Labor: Division of Meanings in Organizational Groups,Intergroup Communication in Organizations and Institutions (Age and Aging),"This paper investigates a paradox posited in Durkheim's (1933) assessment of the division of labor, namely its benefits to production and solidarity. Because the division of labor aims to increase organizational efficiency, a paradox arises when employees solidarity within divisions comes at the expense of overall systemic productivity across divisions (Flache, 2002). In-group dynamics (within each division) enable unique contextual meanings to arise and define the local environment which may erode inter-group dynamics (across divisions) and larger system goals. Such division of meanings within the division of labor stems from members developing a shared perspective (Goffman, 1967). We illustrate the paradoxical relationship between production and solidarity with excerpts from employees of a municipality where divisions are physically and socially defined. Employees voice their solidarity within given departments, while physically and functionally distant departments exhibit social distance in the meanings they attribute to system-wide/organizational artifacts (e-mail) and events (a holiday party). This division of meanings that inadvertently arise between such divisions of labor may come to destabilize larger organizational processes, for example an organizations efforts to implement and use a new the email system."
2009-0887,Mars and Venus in Virtual Space: Postfeminist Humor and the Internet,"Feminist Voices, Histories, and Cross-Cultural Interactions",,,,Paper,Mars and Venus in Virtual Space: Postfeminist Humor and the Internet,"Feminist Voices, Histories, and Cross-Cultural Interactions","This paper explores the ideological assumptions encoded in contemporary Internet humor about gender. Based on a grounded analysis of 150 popular texts, we identified five major themes in online humor about gender: Three traditional themes of Sex, Marriage and Blondes and two post-feminist themes that focus on gender differences, individualism and empowerment, which we titled Mars and Venus and Girl Power. While seemingly new themes and formats, a close analysis of the post-feminist humorous texts leads us to argue that these are symptoms of backlash where old sexist themes are packed in innovative ways. Moreover, the battles of the sexes frame dominating these new texts, does not allow any resolution or meeting between the essentially different genders. Whereas sexist and post-feminist notions are dominant in popular online humor, critical feminist texts are almost utterly absent from it. What is also missing is any concern for the public sphere, or issues of race, class, or nationality. Thus, popular Internet humor serves as a sophisticated and powerful mechanism for the naturalization of universal stereotypes about gender differences."

In this paper we describe an approach to using culturally sensitive mass media messages to change the beliefs and behavior of African-American adolescents at risk for HIV. This approach exploits the potential that mass media messages have, not only to reach a large segment of the adolescent population and thereby supporting normative change, but also to engage the most at-risk segments of this group to change their behavior. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach with results from an ongoing HIV-prevention trial directed to African-American adolescents in two medium sized cities in the US."

Shils and Daniel Bell in the vanguard. Criticisms drew on an accumulation of evidence from social science studies about the continuing significance of informal social relationships in modern society. This paper traces the varying definitions of ""mass"" back to their origins and to their underlying assumptions about the nature of changes attending industrialization and and advances in communication technology that made possible rapid transmission of a uniform content to a geographically dispersed audience. Much of the criticism of the concept of mass strikes us as misdirected, on the one side, at conservatives who fear the masses and, on the other, at the disdain felt mostly, but not exclusively, by neo-Marxist intellectuals toward the culture of the market place. When mass behavior is sociologically rather than ideologically defined, as it should be, its increasingly important role in contemporary life becomes unavoidably clear."

Simultaneously, tracking software recorded their mouse clicks and keyboard input automatically.

Data revealed a range of sophistication in childrens mathematical strategies during gameplay. Moreover, consistent with research on classroom mathematics, those children who used more sophisticated strategies often did not apply them immediately. Rather, they engaged in cycles of problem solving that began with less sophisticated strategies and progressed to more sophisticated approaches when necessary.

Comparisons among observation, interview, and online tracking data showed these strategies could be detected via data mining too. Tracking data showed consistent patterns of online responses reflecting each strategy, and clusters of errors at points when childrens strategies broke down and they shifted to new strategies. However, in the absence of in-person observations, some areas of mathematical content were better represented by tracking data than others. Implications will be discussed regarding childrens mathematical reasoning in applied contexts, the role of prior knowledge in playing educational games, and the use of data mining for assessment in educational research and practice."

Consequently, diversified principles and practices have emerged. Few studies, however, have captured such diversity in the absence of effective measuring and accurate mapping methods. To measure development journalism effectively, this paper proposed a three-prong approach: (a) actor, (b) source, and (c) orientation. To map development journalism accurately, this paper proposed a three-pro approach: (a) pro-process, (b) pro-participation, and (c) pro-government. And to demonstrate how these two approaches work, this paper offered a case study of comparative content analysis of poverty coverage."
2009-0893,Measuring Instant Messaging: Chatting vs. Being Signed In,"lf Presentation, Representation, and Affiliation",,,,Paper,Measuring Instant Messaging: Chatting vs. Being Signed In,"Self Presentation, Representation, and Affiliation","Instant messengers (IMers) support social relationships by bringing people together virtually, even though they may be physically apart. Users of IMers typically spend a lot of time signed in without actually chatting. From a dialectical perspective, we argue that this mere act of being signed in is already meaningful for users. As long as users are signed in, there is a continuous potential for interaction with their online buddies. It is possible that the experience of this continuous potential for interaction (symbolized by a list of buddies who are always out there) generates a sense of symbolic proximity to ones network, even when not actually chatting.
An exploratory survey study (N=121) was set up in which both a measure of the time spent signed in and a measure of the time spent chatting were related to a set of different attitudinal and behavioural measures, once with controls for other measures (partial correlations) and once without (correlations). The results indicate that the more time people spend signed in (independent of the time they spend chatting), the more important their IMer is, the more they experience symbolic proximity through it, the more they appreciate the IMer for being available to others and for making others available, the less sociable they are, and the more problematic their IMer use is. These relationships were not found for the time spent chatting (independent of the time spent signed in). Therefore the results support the conceptual notion that being signed in constitutes meaningful behavior."

Technological developments that have led to a blossoming of cable, satellite, and Internet news outlets encourage news providers to cater to segmented rather than mass audiences. The increasing number of news programs and formats on television has precipitated a steady migration of audiences toward these new options and away from the network news programs and printed newspapers. These developments have led the American National Election Study (ANES) to try new ways of measuring news exposure. In addition, the ANES has introduced measures designed to assess how citizens use the political information to which they are exposed. Measures of Need for Closure and Need for Cognition may provide researchers with the ability to predict what partisans will seek and use from news and other information sources. We will discuss how measures of psychological predispositions are related to news exposure and examine how improved measures of news exposure predict political knowledge and other important criterion variables."

When holding such an assumption, the question as to what factors lead to the accomplishment of one's goals becomes a central issue. The purpose of this paper was to address this question in the context of mediated interpersonal communication. From the perspective of Read and Miller's (1989 Miller & Read, 1991) interpersonalism approach to communication planning, media affordances are argued to serve as plan furthering resources. Specifically, the media affordance of information control is argued to be a key resource in this process. The results of two-part empirical investigation largely support the arguments for this role. Future research and the implications for the role of information control and other media affordances are discussed."

We use public opinion data gathered in late 2004 and content analytic data to test a variant of the basic agenda setting hypothesis. We find that the number of mentions of French firms in the French press is positively related with the ease with which the public can form an opinion (in other words, assign a reputation) regarding that firm. We also find that a firms characteristics, specifically, the existence of a retail identity is related to the ease with which opinions are formed regarding a company. Finally, we uncover evidence regarding the similarity of business news reporting across business and mainstream newspapers. This indicator of content homogeneity might have important civic implications in France and beyond."

The authors explore how cultural hierarchy is affected by specific features of these societies and their respective journalistic and cultural production fields.
The four countries show significant differences in journalistic attention to high and popular art forms. Throughout the period of study, the New York Times, and, to a slightly lesser extent, French elite newspapers generally devote more attention to popular art forms than their Dutch and German counterparts. In accounting for cross-national differences in the coverage given to popular culture, field level factors like market structure and relationship with local industries seem more important than more remote societal factors such as national cultural repertoires, the level of societal openness and social heterogeneity"

The present study analyzes some ways in which the ritual concept has been used to interpret media products or processes; our purpose is to identify those elements of continuity and rupture in rapport with the basics interpretations and theories of anthropology. We want to show that the capacity of journalistic discourse of ritualizing certain public events open up a new field, and a new logic in anthropological research: it suggest media function as a ritualizing agent, which builds symbolic spaces of action and thinking through mediated communication. The mission of such an approach would be that of showing how symbolic thinking is constructed at a global level (or, at least, more encompassing than that of the multiple local knowledge), by means of complex media (as compared to the body and to the uttered language), through the syncretism of symbolic often heterogeneous systems, in the absence of space and cultural proximity, through the efforts of actors (political actors and journalists) whose social and ideological positions are radically different from those of the usual (for anthropologists) religious specialists."
2009-0900,Media Attention Dynamics in Complex Societies: A Conceptual Framework,Expanding the Study of Agenda Setting,,,,Paper,Media Attention Dynamics in Complex Societies: A Conceptual Framework,Expanding the Study of Agenda Setting,"Studies have shown that issue attention in the mass media is not steady and does not necessar-ily correspond to objective real world criteria. Furthermore, it often follows inherently dy-namic waves of ups and downs, which are highly nonlinear and in most cases unpredictable. Existing frameworks for studying media attention dynamics comprise models of issue atten-tion cycles like proposed by Luhmann and Downs in the 1970s combined with theories of news selection and agenda-building. These approaches succeed in retracing issue careers and isolating numerous factors, which could explain their characteristics. However, the interplay of these factors and the mechanisms, which could produce the observed discourse dynamics have not yet been sufficiently analyzed. The paper proposes to advance the existing ap-proaches by embedding them into the interdisciplinary perspective of complexity theory. Concepts like nonlinearity, emergence, self-organization and feedback are introduced, and their use for studying dynamics of mass mediated risk discourses is made clear. Additionally, the paper also shows that methods of the complexity perspective, respectively agent-based modeling and simulation, can be meaningfully applied to analyze the underlying mechanisms of issue attention. It concludes by proposing a basic design for an agent-based model of media attention dynamics."

To what extent, however, do audiences engage with these commercial appeals? This paper draws from a large audience research study of four makeover television shows: The Biggest Loser, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Starting Over, and What Not to Wear. We asked regular viewers of the shows whether they remembered advertised or placed products from the shows, whether they had purchased any of these, and whether they had bought books and DVDs associated with the shows. Most respondents said that they did not buy products advertised or featured on these shows, and they were highly critical of clumsy product placement. Nor did they buy the show's related media very often; sometimes they critiqued the shows for withholding information in order to make people buy the book or DVD. For all the legitimate concerns about escalating commercialism of reality television, there may be cause for optimism concerning viewers' actual buying behavior, even if they do not reject consumerism per se. Only by engaging with audiences of media forms such as makeover television can we begin to assess the impact of advertising and product placement on viewers."
2009-0902,"Media, Authenticity, and Religion Søren Kierkegaard as Media Critic",Reconceptualizing Communication History,,,,Paper,"Media, Authenticity, and Religion Søren Kierkegaard as Media Critic",Reconceptualizing Communication History,"Abstract


In this paper Søren Kierkegaards Two ages is analysed as an example of early modern media criticism. Existentialist thinkers like Nietzsche, Jaspers, Heidegger and Sartre have dealt with the authenticity of the self, and the ideal of staying true to the uniqueness of ones own being in spite of societal or cultural obstacles. Sartre, for example, noted that his time and culture was too artificial to allow for authenticity of the self. Media has often been seen as a part of the increasingly artificial landscape of modern society. For Kierkegaard, however, the criticism of media had a clearly religious dimension. From a different angle than John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville  who both considered the problem of the public sphere and the press in the 19th century as tyranny of the masses  Kierkegaard disliked the press because it offered a shortcut to forming own opinions by presenting ready-made thoughts and shallow entertainment instead of helping people in facing reality. The media offered escape from reality into fiction, from your own experiences into someone elses and as a consequence, was a threat to religious life. He saw media as an intervening agency, blocking peoples way to true experiences, authenticity and, ultimately, God."
2009-0903,Media Choice in Social Networks,Evolving Perspectives on Media Choice,,,,Paper,Media Choice in Social Networks,Evolving Perspectives on Media Choice,"The choice of mass media devices and specific content is interrelated with social networks in two distinct ways. On one hand media choice by an individual person is influenced by the social context. On the other hand the media use of an individual recipient determines to a certain extent friendship choices. The focus of this contribution lies on the first process. However empirical tests necessarily have to take both processes into account to control for each other. It is argued that socially determined media choices can only be analyzed with a longitudinal analysis of social networks. The empirical setting therefore includes four panel waves of 36 social groups (school classes; N = 895). Results of an actor oriented model show significant effects for both hypothesized selection and influence processes. The discussion of the result includes a comparison of different media devices and contents.

This paper addresses this deficit and aims to outline these concepts' potential for a philosophy of science and societal diagnosis.
By reconstructing the use of these terms in current academic discourse it will become obvious that they themselves are parts of academic struggle and debate. Accounting for the use of Media Culture in communication studies this requires the necessity to define the term and the idea of Media Culture in a more systematic way and to argue in detail why it is an instructive approach. In order to avoid a static understanding of Media Culture and to emphasise its procedural character, the concept of ""Mediatization"" is introduced. Mediatization addresses the change of media and related practices of communication on macro as well as on the micro level. This demands to examine communication as mediated forms of social practises. These are currently shaped by such fundamental developments like individualization, globalization and marketization of social spheres. In conceptualizing Media Culture and Mediatization against this background this paper will contribute theoretically and empirically to the development of critical media analysis."

In this paper, I present findings from quantitative content analysis of a constructed week of the top two network newscasts in Mexico, Costa Rica, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In Chile I analyze the top four newscasts, so that two commercial and two ""public"" media outlets are included. I measured the class, race, and gender of journalists on the newscasts and the figures featured in the news. Early findings confirm the lack of content diversity criticized in critical essays on Latin American news, with little-to-no variation due to primary versus secondary ratings leadership among commercial newscasts. I also found little country-level differences among the commercial newscasts. As expected, and pending more analysis, there is variation between private commercial (oligopoly) ownership and ""public"" ownership (found in Chile only), although the differences are not as large as some theorists might predict."

In comparison to previous research, we tested media effects in a two-wave panel survey controlling for prior stereotypes and policy opinions. As a result, we found that exposure to TV news and political round-table discussions exerted a causal effect on stereotype activation. However, these media induced stereotypes did not translate to policy opinions. More importantly, exposure to tabloid news elicited stereotypical thoughts about ethnic minorities among readers who process media information less systematically. Similarly, relative to all other media users, low-involvement tabloid users preferred more punitive measures in the treatment of ethnic minorities. Thus, among low-involvement users, tabloids activated group-related stereotypes of ethnic minorities on which recipients relied when forming policy opinions."

In this environment, social scientists are being challenged to write and format their work as applied research with expectations from clinicians, the press, and others that results can be distilled into actionable and digestible sound bites. Social science, however, relies on a rich history of hypothesis testing and theory building that does not necessary lend itself well to this type of interpretation. This presentation will discuss the dilemma of fitting social science research about media effects into the world of applied medical science and the compromises and opportunities that academic researchers face as their work is interpreted and utilized in ways they may not have initially intended."

In particular, we examined the effects of two types of frames (enemy vs. dialogue partner) and two types of story focus (policy vs. personal), while controlling for peoples familiarity with and favorability to the leaders and their countries. Conducting a between-subjects experiment, we found that the enemy and dialogue partner frames of Ahmadinejad and Kim had a significant impact on peoples perceptions of the leaders as a threat to the United States and as being open to dialogue with the United States. Moreover, the impact of the enemy frame depended on whether news stories focused on policies of the leaders or their personal traits and political maneuvering. The influence of the enemy frame was stronger when the frame was used in a story focusing on personal traits of the leaders than on policies of the leaders. Our study offers important empirical evidence regarding how media frames influence audiences perceptions of foreign leaders. Implications of the study are discussed in terms of the media coverage of international issues."

In this way, framing is considered to be a two-step process, where media frames prime, or activate some knowledge, thus making attitude change more likely (Entman, 2004; Zaller, 1992). According to Iyengar and Kinder (1987), through this frame priming, the press influences the standards by which policies are judged. This study presents findings on the impact of the framing of terrorist events on attitudes regarding fear of terrorism, Muslims, civil liberties, and counter terrorism policies. We report on the results of an experiment in which subjects were presented actual televised news coverage of the 2005 London bombings framed either as perpetrated by domestic or international terrorists. We examine the interaction of these two frames with attitudes towards Muslims and restrictions upon civil liberties and consider the implications for both reporting and counterterrorism strategies by governments. We find that framing incidents as domestic or ""homegrown"" in nature raises more fear and concern which leads to support for restricting civil liberties of Muslims, and in some cases general feelings of negativity toward Muslims. We also find support for the hydraulic effect of framing where the domestic manipulation has a strong enough impact to repress party identification in attitude formation."
2009-0910,Media Habits,Media Selection,,,,Paper,Media Habits,Media Selection,"To what extent is media consumption behavior a matter of habit rather than continuing and active self-instruction? On a physiological level, control over repeated behaviors gradually shifts from cortical regions to the cerebrum as environmental stimuli replace expected behavioral outcomes as the proximal determinants of behavior. Social psychology research confirms that nonconscious habits and conscious intentions act together to guide media behavior and suggests that over half of media behaviors are habitual. Habitual, automatic media consumption acts are repeated behaviors that take place in stable circumstances with limited awareness, attention, control, or intentionality. This challenges a common assumption of mass communication research that media selections are determined by active and conscious thought processes. While an early uses and gratifications model included habits, later empirical studies confounded conscious and habitual processes and thus obscured the impact of habits on media selections. To the contrary, research inspired by Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior established habits and conscious expected outcomes as co-determinants of media consumption. From this analysis, habits emerge as automatic thought processes that are powerful predictors of media behavior. Habits offer a rival hypothesis to theories of media attendance that are based on attitudes, beliefs, gratifications sought, and other conscious, media-related cognitions. A new model of media selection behavior is proposed in which active and conscious media selections gradually become habitual, at which point habits and conscious intentions jointly determine media consumption behaviors."

Drawing on a survey of 1195 television viewers, we found that genre (special interest versus general interest), program evaluation, and the programs informational value positively affect brand memory, attitudes and behavior. These results support theories on spill over and media gratifications. The effect of genre on viewers behavior was partially mediated by the programs perceived informational value. This study shows the importance of context factors in audience responses to brand placement and shows the underlying mechanisms."

However, less is known about its effects in our ethnic communities, including among Mexican-heritage youth who are in the fastest growing minority group and at elevated risk for substance use compared to other groups. For these youth, Spanish language media provide an option that may not have the same level of deleterious effects as that found for mainstream media consumption. In addition to language usage, parent-child communication plays a critical role in childrens media consumption. Using cross-sectional data (N=1,243), the present study examined the hypothesis that social cognitive processes mediated the relationship between media exposure and Mexican-heritage youth alcohol use and that media language preference and parent-child communication about alcohol use moderated the relationship. The results supported the predictions that the relationship between media exposure and alcohol use was mediated by social cognitive components and that the relationship was moderated by parent-child communication. However, contrary to expectations, the results did not support the hypothesis that exposure to Spanish language media served as a protective factor for alcohol use. Practical implications, research limitations, and future directions are discussed."

Currently, many educators fear sharing or publishing curriculum materials that incorporate copyrighted materials due to their deep misunderstanding of copyright and fair use. In developing the Code, media literacy scholars found that media literacy educators want to create learning experiences where learners can make transformative uses of copyrighted materials in their own academic and creative work. In particular, samples of student work must be shared as a means to elucidate aspects of how media literacy concepts inform the teaching and learning process."

It has a warm and positive feel to it and is something to which stakeholders are happy to sign up to in one way, shape or form. The sub-textual message inferred by the term CSR is that corporations are socially responsible. The question asked here is, are they? How is it perceived by key stakeholders such as journalists? This paper will explore the extent to which public relations practitioners CSR discourse is perceived and ultimately adopted by media practitioners. The paper discusses findings from research into journalists perceptions of media messages as well as their utilisation. The discussion will revolve around how the media view organisations engagement with CSR through one or more of five possible orientations: Conformist, Cynic, Realist, Optimist and Strategic Idealist. These theoretical constructs are explained and their utility and usefulness as tools of practical analysis explored through application.

That corporations can act irresponsibly is not something easily refuted. CSI and CSR are politically infused language based terms that surround and are about the roles of business, corporations and the politics and discourse of the workplace. The language used is soothing, calming and designed to ameliorate dissenting points of view. It is about building consent. One term cannot be conceived without the other, they are intertwined, belong to and are about each other. It is suggested in the paper that CSI and CSR are part and parcel of the fabric of the ideal of a free, democratic, stakeholding, capitalist economy and society. As such, they are issues that require monitoring and the engagement of active citizenship (see Marshall, 1963). Despite being open to positive news coverage media reports of CSR issues are often negative in tone and the tension inherent to the Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI) and CSR dualism is alluded to within the discussion. The paper concludes with a consideration of theory development in relation to the research findings.

2009-0915,Media Pluralism by Default: The Case of Moldova,The Complexities of Watchdogging,,,,Paper,Media Pluralism by Default: The Case of Moldova,The Complexities of Watchdogging,"This article shows how Moldovas weak political state, anemic economy, and cultural fragmentation are interestingly key contributors to the countrys media pluralism. Print and broadcast journalists from Moldovan-language and Russian-language media in Moldova represent a variety of views, ranging from independent coverage to advocacy journalism, according to several national and international monitoring groups. Yet the country has endured governmental, financial, and ethnic instability during the 17 years since its independence from the Soviet Union. This analysis shows how such instability can fuel media diversity, rather than quash it. The findings expand what is known about media pluralism by demonstrating how it can grow in seemingly inhospitable environments."

It discusses and explains the type and frequencies of their contacts, the circumstances and locations of their interaction, and routines that characterize their meetings. This includes both formal and non-formal newsgathering methods, rules and customs, and the outcome of their interactions. Furthermore, the paper discusses peculiar socio-cultural traits of Japanese society and the extent to which these characteristics affect reporters newsgathering methods, their dependency on political sources, and decision-making within and between newsrooms. The paper focuses particularly on aspects of group behavior that affect the contacts reporters have with high-echelon political leaders--including the prime minister, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, and leaders of political parties and party factions-- who, in turn, shape the content of mainstream political journalism. It discusses the structure and focus of political news, and the language and methods information sources use to disseminate information and put their desired spin on events that take place in the polity. Moreover, this paper illustrates how the nuances and tone of language used by Diet members and officials shape the countrys political culture, as well as the ways non-Japanese perceive Japans views of world events."
2009-0917,Media Preferences and Democracy: Refining the 'Relative Entertainment Preference' Hypothesis,Political News: Antecedents and Consequences of Use,,,,Paper,Media Preferences and Democracy: Refining the 'Relative Entertainment Preference' Hypothesis,Political News: Antecedents and Consequences of Use,"This paper extends the work of Markus Prior connecting media choice and relative preferences for entertainment to voter turnout. Prior's analyses found that individuals who both preferred entertaining content to news and had either cable or Internet access were less likely to vote than were other citizens. As an update to his work, this paper uses more recent Pew surveys to test alternative measures of entertainment preferences and to update the Internet access findings for the broadband age. As a theoretical extension, this paper looks at turnout differences among those with finer content preferences. Specifically, people who prefer hard news are compared to those choosing entertaining news (e.g., entertainment, sports, and arts). The results indicate that there is value in considering Relative Entertaining News Preference in addition toor even instead ofrelative entertainment preferences alone."
2009-0918,Media Primes and Their Effects on Bicultural Individuals,Keywords in Information Systems: Priming (High Density),,,,Paper,Media Primes and Their Effects on Bicultural Individuals,Keywords in Information Systems: Priming (High Density),"The current study extends previous research by using more quotidian media primes in the form of television commercials to establish the threshold of cultural priming. It also examines if attitudinal and perceptual dispositions can be activated by media content along with the respective cultural dispositions of independence and interdependence. Results indicate that, in contrast with previous studies, causal attribution of behavior was not affected by media priming. Some support for priming effects on perception that is consistent with existing research was found. Participants exposed to the media messages that activate a cultural orientation that is more typically Western made more references to focal objects in a subsequent recollection task of a picture while those presented media messages that activate a cultural orientation that is more typically Asian reported relatively higher scores on the interdependent self-construal measure. However, taken together, the findings suggest that media priming effects on culturally-linked perception and cognition are a fairly weak phenomenon, at least in the context of this study, given that partial support was found for only two out of the four pairs of hypotheses posed."
2009-0919,Media Ratings: To See or Not To See?,Regulating and Mediating Children's Media Use,,,,Paper,Media Ratings: To See or Not To See?,Regulating and Mediating Children's Media Use,"To inform parents about and protect children and adolescents against violent or otherwise harmful media content, media-rating systems are used in many countries. Generally speaking, these systems consist of age pictograms and content warning pictograms for media productions (television programs, movies, DVDs and games). An experimental study was conducted to investigate whether these pictograms, in contrast to their purpose, have an appealing effect on children and adolescents.
In the experiment, 332 elementary school students and 337 high school students were exposed to ten covers of DVDs or games. The participants were asked to judge the attractiveness of the DVDs and games. Participants were randomly assigned to either a DVD or game condition. Then, in two age categories (9-11 years and 13-15 years) they were randomly assigned to eight groups. These groups were based on the presence or absence of an age pictogram (no age classification, all ages, 12 years, or 16 years) and on the presence or absence of a combination of three warning pictograms (violence, sexuality, and abusive language).
The results show that the pictograms did not increase the attractiveness of the games and DVDs for children and adolescents. They nevertheless seemed to pay some attention to the pictograms. The appreciation of the elementary school students showed a negative influence of the warning pictograms and the high school students preferred media products with the pictogram 12 years above media products for all ages."

It further explores how such differences can be accounted by various socioeconomic and cultural factors. Using a comparative framework to conceptualize the impact of different factors on media contents, results in this study reveal the diverse extent of sensational portrayals of suicide stories across three societies, as well as the discrepant reporting styles between general and tabloid-style papers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and between party media and city newspapers in Mainland China. The results are discussed with reference to sensationalism, media culture, and various contributing factors posited by the comparative conceptual framework."
2009-0921,Media Representations of Appalachian Poverty: Culture or Capital; Corruption or Coal?,Media Representations,,,,Paper,Media Representations of Appalachian Poverty: Culture or Capital; Corruption or Coal?,Media Representations,"By some scholarly accounts, for much of the 20th century and still today, the media has contributed to a stereotyping of Appalachia that has defined the region as backwards and its people as intellectually challenged, morally destitute, and culturally inferior. These characterizations entail assorted problems, including that they can serve as a convenient explanation for some of the poverty in the region. In a somewhat collective sense, since the early 1970s many Appalachian scholars have confronted this stereotyping. Amidst these efforts, however, limited work exists that truly quantifies the extent to which people living in Appalachia remain victims of widespread media stereotyping. In relation to this matter, this research offers a systematic content analysis of how major U.S. newspapers portray poverty in Appalachia. It focuses on cultural versus structural depictions of poverty, both of which have received particular attention in academic literature about Appalachia. Furthermore, for comparative purposes this research examines portrayals of poverty in other place-based contexts, particularly areas that, like parts of Appalachia, have historically had relatively high poverty rates. The inclusion of these control groups is done as a means to determine if media stereotyping of Appalachian poverty is not only systemic, but if it is more common than in relation to other locations and people. The overall analysis included both a quantitative and qualitative examination of content. It concluded that links between Appalachia, culture, and poverty not only persist in the media, but are of a nature that many people would undoubtedly find offensive."
2009-0922,Media Studies and the Global South: The Arab World and Latin America as Axis of Theory,Provincializing Media Studies,,,,Paper,Media Studies and the Global South: The Arab World and Latin America as Axis of Theory,Provincializing Media Studies,"My struggle to develop meaningful approaches to global media studies beyond the field's Eurocentric premises has profoundly influenced my project Reality Television and Arab Politics: Contention in Public Life (Cambridge University Press, forthcoming, 2009). This presentation draws on that work to contribute to provincializing media studies. Examining a series of controversies that first erupted in 2003 in various Arab countries over format-adapted reality TV shows, I attempt to map out forces that shape Arab public life. My central argument is that the pan-Arab reality TV wars are best understood as a social laboratory where rival visions of modernity are elaborated. Modernization theory has little to offer to that endeavor. More illuminating to contemporary Arab culture is the tiempos mixtos framework of Nestor García-Canclini, Jesús Martín-Barbero and others who grappled with the dynamics and dilemmas of Latin American modernities. But helpful as they are, applying these ideas in the Arab world mutatis mutandis would reiterate modernization theory's ethnocentrism. Based on my experience with Reality Television and Arab Politics, I critically discuss the promises and perils of ""South-to-South"" theoretical articulations for empirically-based projects in media studies."
2009-0923,Media Systems and Political Systems: Dimensions of Comparison,"Media Policy, Media Systems, and Democracy",,,,Paper,Media Systems and Political Systems: Dimensions of Comparison,"Media Policy, Media Systems, and Democracy","In social science the interdependency between media systems and political systems is commonly undoubted. Yet, empirical knowledge about the relationship between both systems is rare. A deeper understanding can be gained by international comparison of media systems and political systems form a macro perspective using aggregated data. The quantitative study presented in this paper, offers a concept for international comparison based on four keywords: freedom, diversity, centrality, and tradition. These keywords serve as dimensions for comparison of both media systems and political systems. The methodological approach is tested using a sample of seven countries from around the world: China, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Russia, and USA. In combination with a pragmatic use of systems theory as theoretical framework, the dimensions allow deeper insights in the interdependency of the relationship between media systems and political systems. In sum, the research project offers a concept for further international comparisons on macro level."

Members orient towards the fact that locations are public, so that a location-aware community makes a particular sort of public space. Issues of co-proximity are one feature that is particularly relevant for such communities, since perceived co-proximities at a distance enact the possibility of a co-present encounter. They therefore entail potential risks and threats, such as the stalking of one member by another.
We have studied such a case in a mobile location-aware community of Japanese players engaged in a collection game called Mogi. Mogi shows the tensions associated with the interweaving of virtual and real locations and places (such as the home), and how the problem is constituted and treated collectively on the spot, within the location-aware community itself."

Taking into account Brazils recent democratization process, the author analyzes mediated deliberation on the national referendum for banning firearm and ammunition sales that took place in this country in 2005. The following indicators are explored: (a) participant accessibility and characterization; (b) use of arguments; (c) reciprocity and responsiveness; and (d) reflexivity and reversibility of opinions. It is argued that normative principles of deliberation add to controversy frame studies by helping understand how contending interlocutors may exchange their arguments, reflect about their opinions, and improve disputed reasons, and eventually review their position  in situations where no consensus or general agreements are expected."

In this paper we provide an additional explanationone that recognizes the major political role currently played by the media. Specifically, we argue that the characteristics of a countrys mass media as well as the citizens news exposure combine to influence different dimensions of political support: from the diffuse, abstract level of support for democracy as an ideal form of government, to the more specific, concrete level of support for regime institutions (e.g., political parties). Instead of assuming additive effects of media ownership (public or private), media environment (pluralistic or restrictive), and news exposure on political support, we propose an interactive model, which we test using both aggregate- and individual-level data from the World Values Survey. In general, the data support the existence of interactive effects between a countrys media system and peoples media use when explaining variation in levels of political support. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories about media systems and public opinion."
2009-0927,Mediating Mechanisms in Narrative Persuasion: The Importance of Identification,Narrative Persuasion,,,,Paper,Mediating Mechanisms in Narrative Persuasion: The Importance of Identification,Narrative Persuasion,"This study investigates whether dimensions of narrative engagement mediate between reading a story and its persuasive effects. The first experiment (n = 152) was aimed at manipulating the level of narrative engagement by disrupting reading. Results showed that engagement dimensions the feeling of being in the narrative world, attentional focus on the story and empathy with the main character were indeed decreased by disruption, but there were no corresponding effects on attitudes. The second experiment (n = 120) was aimed at manipulating the level of the engagement-dimension identification with story characters by a manipulation of the story perspective. The same story was told from the perspective of one of the two characters who held opposing attitudes. Results showed that both identification with story characters and attitudes were affected by the perspective of the story. Mediation analysis showed that identification with one of the characters mediated in these persuasive effects. The results of these two experiments indicate that identification may be a more important mechanism of narrative persuasion than other dimensions of narrative engagement."
2009-0928,"Mediation, Emotions, and the Dispositions for Ethical Action",Mediation and Emotion,,,,Paper,"Mediation, Emotions, and the Dispositions for Ethical Action",Mediation and Emotion,"A broad concept of mediation (Silverstone, Martin-Barbero) makes it well-suited to focus the ethical questions raised by medias role in everyday life. But the idea that emotions supplement cognitive rationality derives from a narrow Enlightenment view of rationality that ignored earlier Aristotelian approaches. Within neo-Aristotelian ethics the problem of media-related emotions is transformed because reasoning and emotion are discussed only within the context of action  what dispositions (virtues) can stably orient our actions towards ends that comprise part of what is good for man? This paper will develop that perspective in relation to the difficulties in Silverstones discussion of media hospitality and how approaches closer to neo-Aristotelian formulations (Honneth, Ricoeur) can extend our understanding of emotions role in stabilising hospitable dispositions in/through media by linking them to conditions of action."
2009-0929,"Mediation, Symbolic Power, and the Emotions of Recognition",Mediation and Emotion,,,,Paper,"Mediation, Symbolic Power, and the Emotions of Recognition",Mediation and Emotion,"This paper argues for a link between emotions and mediation. Drawing on Silverstones understanding of mediation as a dialectical  yet asymmetrically structured  process involving the circulation of meaning (1999; 2005) and Raymond Williams critical analysis of mediation as both intermediary and disguise of power (1977) which the researcher must uncover, this paper examines how the moral emotions of recognition (Honneth 1995 and 2007) such as anger, resentment and shame are implicated in the process of mediation. The paper observes that such emotions arise when peoples personal experiences and self identities clash with their mediated representations resulting in what Honneth calls disrespect (2007). The paper argues that because anger and shame often arise as a result of asymmetrical social relations, research on mediated emotions inevitably constitutes an analysis of symbolic power and the asymmetrical relationships inherent in the process of mediation (who has the power to represent whom). In this sense the mediated emotions of shame and anger can be understood both as the consequence of mediation and also as constituting evidence of media power."
2009-0930,Mediatization of Political Decision-Making Processes,Mediatization as an Integrative Concept for Political Communication Research,,,,Paper,Mediatization of Political Decision-Making Processes,Mediatization as an Integrative Concept for Political Communication Research,"The fourth paper is concerned with the consequences of mediated political communication for the rules and routines of political decision-making (e.g. institutions) in European democracies. It starts out from the widely held assumption of governance research that non-hierarchical forms of decision making  that is bargaining and negotiation  have become predominant in democratic multi-level governance settings. In a second step the preconditions of institutional stability and change are being clarified. By applying the political science framework of New Institutionalism one can expect that the stability of a political institution depends on two factors: performance and support. In the third step I will argue that the media might influence the performance aspect of political negotiations by affecting the behavior of actors within the network, and the support aspect by influencing public opinion towards negotiations. Empirical research is based on case studies from Germany and Switzerland. It combines a comprehensive content analysis of media coverage with online surveys, document analysis and expert interviews. Results indicate that bargained decision-making is highly visible in German and Swiss media. The coverage is mostly negative in both countries. Experimental studies demonstrate that this kind of coverage causes negative effects on public confidence in political institutions. Finally it is shown that the mere presence of the media alters the behavior of participants in negotiation networks. Thus compromise-seeking is becoming much more complicated in mediatized democracies."
2009-0931,Mediatization of Political Organizations,Mediatization as an Integrative Concept for Political Communication Research,,,,Paper,Mediatization of Political Organizations,Mediatization as an Integrative Concept for Political Communication Research,"The third paper discusses the concept of mediatization on the level of political organizations. The concept is concretized as a reaction of political organizations to their perception of an increased importance of the media and of best practice models in communication. Mediatization implies changes in organizational structure (rules and resources for communication) and behavior (amount and form of communication). This definition of mediatization on an organizational level allows the development of indicators for empirical research and seems to be more appropriate than concepts of a simple adaptation of political actors to the needs of the mass media. The paper summarizes case studies on structural changes within traditional and large party organizations in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and the UK. The studies have focused on the national party central offices out of election campaigns, analyzed party documents and interviewed party representatives from October 2006 to January 2007. The main conclusion is that mediatization on the level of party organizations take place, but not to the expected extent when reviewing the academic literature. Processes of mediatization are slowed down by loosely-coupled forms of party organizations (especially internal federalism), which degree is dependent on the country specific context. Therefore, from the organizations point of view, mediatization leads to conflicts between the requirements of a ""professional"" media communication (for instance on speed) and internal factions (for instance on participation or at least consultation)."
2009-0932,Mediatization of Political Reality,Mediatization as an Integrative Concept for Political Communication Research,,,,Paper,Mediatization of Political Reality,Mediatization as an Integrative Concept for Political Communication Research,"This second paper approaches mediatization from a symbolic interactionist perspective. It asks how political reality is defined and constructed by the news media, and expects this construction process to be guided by media-specific frames and formats that influence readers political worldviews. The study investigates across four decades and four Western countries whether media content of political affairs is governed by a media logic or political logic. Its goals are threefold: to map Western political news cultures according to their media-centeredness, to link these news cultures to structural features of the political and media systems, and to draw conclusions about democracy-related news performance. Findings indicate that media coverage of political affairs today is governed more by media logic than it was in previous decades. Findings also indicate that the extent to which political news coverage is characterized by media logic is dependent on media commercialism, professional and institutional autonomy of journalists, and the countrys political communication culture. The inclusion of democracy-related content categories such as diversity of sources, range of topics, passive vs activated citizen perspective, or dialogic structure of arguments allows for conclusions about the relationship between mediatization and democracy-related news standards."
2009-0933,Mediatization of Politics: A Conceptual Framework,Mediatization as an Integrative Concept for Political Communication Research,,,,Paper,Mediatization of Politics: A Conceptual Framework,Mediatization as an Integrative Concept for Political Communication Research,"This opening paper conceptualizes the mediatization of politics as a four-dimensional framework. The first dimension is concerned with the degree to which the media constitute a dominant and influential source of information on politics and society. To the extent that the media constitute the dominant source of information and channel of communication, politics has become mediated. The second dimension is concerned with the degree to which the media are independent from political institutions in terms of how the media are governed. The third dimension is concerned with the degree to which media content mainly is governed by media logic as opposed to a political logic. The fourth dimension is concerned with the degree to which political actors  most importantly, parties and candidates  mainly are governed by media logic or a political logic. Aside from developing the above-mentioned four-dimensional conceptualization of the mediatization of politics, the paper will focus on the first dimension and analyze the distinction between mediated politics and mediatized politics, and develop an understanding of how the mediation of politics functions as a precondition for the further mediatization of politics. One of the conclusions will be that while the mediation of politics does not equal the mediatization of politics, the mediatization of politics cannot be understood without a thorough understanding of the mediation of politics and hence the medias role in creating the pseudo-environment (Lippman, 1922) or fantasy worlds (Nimmo & Combs, 1983) that people rely upon when forming their attitudes and opinions."

An examination of media coverage on this issue was executed using media transparency framework (Tsetsura, 2005), and revealed the following findings. First, at the national level, most media hold supportive attitudes toward ENGOs, except for one media outlet that is affiliated with the party media − Peoples Daily. Second, at the local level, analysis showed that the media provided overly supportive coverage for the company, which can be attributed to potential influence of the company on the local media. The results of this case study once again demonstrated that the lack of media transparency is manifested more often at the local level than at the national. The study offered theoretical and practical implications of the findings and recommendations for future research."

Two theoretical models for the effect of media usage on perceived opinion diversity  mediated opinion distribution model and social projection model  were discussed and tested. Path analysis revealed results consistent with the social projection model by showing that both the positive effect of exposure to media of pluralistic content on perceived opinion diversity and the negative effect of exposure to media of monopolistic content on perceived opinion diversity are mediated by its influence on extremity of own opinions."

This study was designed to systematically describe sources of uncertainty across the transplant trajectory. We interviewed 38 pre-transplant (n = 8) and post-transplant (n = 30) patients (16 men, 22 women). Participants reported medical, personal, and social forms of uncertainty. Prior to receiving a transplant, participants reported experiencing medical uncertainty related to (a) having insufficient information about their diagnosis, (b) complex decisions about going on the waiting list, (c) unknown organ availability, and (d) unclear expectations regarding medical procedures and outcomes. They reported that the medical uncertainty they experienced after the transplant was related to (a) complex medication regimens and (b) the unpredictability of their future health. Prior to receiving a transplant, participants may experience personal uncertainty related to (a) finding meaning in life despite illness, (b) current and anticipated role changes, and (c) unclear financial consequences. After receiving a transplant, they may experience uncertainty related to (a) conflicting emotions of gratitude and depression, (b) the inability to fulfill previous roles, and (c) unclear financial consequences. Finally, pre-transplant patients can experience social forms of uncertainty, including (a) questioning from others and (b) unclear relational implications. Post-transplant patients may experience uncertainty related to (a) negative interpersonal reactions and (b) unclear relational implications. These findings serve as a precursor to understanding uncertainty management among transplant patients, and lead us to suggest that health care professionals and supportive others cannot apply a one-size-fits-all solution when aiding others in uncertainty management."

An Analysis of Personal Contacts Between MPs and Political Journalists in Five European Countries",The Press and the Political Establishment: Toward a Better Understanding of Political Journalism,"Power relations between politicians and journalists are often depicted as a tango with one actor being the leading partner. This study analyzes interactions between politicians and journalists not by posing the question of who leads the dance but rather by investigating which politicians are invited to dance and who are better able to take the lead. Building upon theories and past research into press-government relations, agenda-setting and comparative politics, three groups of hypotheses on a personal, party and political system level are derived and tested using a unique survey with Members of Parliament (MP) in five Democratic Corporatist countries (Belgium, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark). The results display a similar pattern in all five countries where parliamentary experience and institutional position increases the frequency of contacts that MPs have with journalists. While party variables have a more modest influence on the frequency of contacts it is shown that there are clear country differences that can be attributed to parliament size in general and a higher inter-MP competition in particular."

But his death on December 2006 forced the media to remember it on the front page. This case study uses textual analysis to examine how the press recalled what had been conveniently forgotten, and explores the role of newspapers in the construction of national, collective memory with four meaning-making strategies: labels, contexts, divides, and focus. These strategies organized the information in restricted terms on Pinochet, his regime and Chiles past, and isolated memories to prevent their public discussion."

Such metadiscursive references allow participants to attempt to structure, or depart, from the public hearing format. Metadiscursive references also work to criticize their opponents speech or the process. Metadiscourse has the consequence of contextualizing the participation framework of the hearing as to topic, length of presentation, and mode of interaction. From a normative perspective, metadiscourse is used to reflect on the folk assumptions about communication as expressed by participants during the public hearing."

In this conversation, participants demonstrate a pattern of metaphor use, re-use, and development, in conjunction with a series of thematically inter-related narratives, that express a complex and ambivalent set of attitudes and feelings toward homelessness and toward the homeless as both outcasts and refugees from conventional society. The results demonstrate how the identification of patterns of metaphor and narrative can provide insights into how people accomplish relational and cultural objectives in everyday talk."

In this context it would be desirable to reach aim for a complete cross referencing, and comparability of data between macro-surveys which are being carried out in different parts of the world. It is therefore desirable that cooperation between research teams of this kind of macro-survey continues and is encouraged further to enable the global knowledge of public relations and management communication profession to be further advanced. But it is less important to exert an internal challenge and questioning about design, methods and techniques applied to the different research studies. This will contribute to the generic objective of increasing the knowledge of public relations and management communication profession all over the world. This is the main contribution this panel aims to make by encouraging the discussion and debate between active researchers in public relations from different national and cultural contexts.

The final paper considers methodological challenges for international and cross cultural public relations research. If we wish to evaluate universal principles of public relations practice and also to understand the diversity and specific peculiarities of practice in different settings then we need to aim for some methods of cross referencing and comparability between data sets. This specifically applies to large scale, multi-region, macro-surveys which do not always permit direct comparison. In essence this part of the panel will present some of the detailed methodological issues that researchers face and pull together some of the thoughts and experiences from trans-national research programmes. This summary paper re-emphasizes the theme of keywords in communication and specifically communication research by exploring how problems and issues with nomenclature and label choice influence research question design, methodology and also practice comparison and compatibility.
Collectively, the four papers provide a critical and diverse exploration of the central issues and set an agenda for a much needed debate on comparative research studies into trends and practices in public relations."

Processes of digitalization and convergence have detached television content from the television screen. Nowadays, viewers choose what, when, where and on which screen they want to watch. This study uses empirical audience research to explore the impact of these alternative routes for the consumption of television content on viewers viewing patterns. Have audiences viewing patterns really changed or do they still follow the suggested program schedule? The results show that almost all respondents adjust the television schedule to their own needs. Concerning the content, series are the programs most likely to be time-shifted. Shifting the screen to watch television on does not often happen. Viewers do not think it is nowadays more difficult to talk about television programs, except for international series. Generally, television is still perceived as a lean-back medium."

The sample includes 300 Mexican students, ages 17 to 25, of Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico City Branch. Variables include usage frequency, consumption contents, production contents, language use, and registered identity. In this work, YouTube is studied as a social network matrix of identity to analyze the social phenomenon of consumption under the logic of mediatic convergence cultures (Jenkins, 2004), collective intelligence (Levy, 1997), and mediascapes (Lash & Urry, 1994), as well as of mediatic cultural identity, understood within the framework of a modernity of fragmented and decentered multicultural identities (Friedman, 1999), as a phenomenon of cultural hybridizations (Nevderveen, 2004), and liquid identities as a new political dimension (Bauman, 2004)."

This paper explores the conditions of production that have allowed M.I.A. to flourish as an insurgent artist, interrogating the ideological and cultural context in which discursive subversion by a subaltern subject is possible in the face of the political tyranny of the war on terror. The central research question is: Do M.I.A.s music and politics represent an emergence of knowledges and desires that are crucial to galvanizing counterhegemonic protest in, and via, contemporary media? The analysis demonstrates how M.I.A. has used guerilla communication technologies to advance her subversive political agenda. Using Sandovals theory of subaltern expression, this paper argues that M.I.A.s circumvention of corporate channels of musical production and distribution is a Third World feminist strategy geared to bringing subaltern politics into First World view."

Our investigation into this new form of organization-stakeholder interaction is based on two complementary research approaches: webmetrics, to describe the general popularity of the blog itself and the use social network analysis to investigate how well the blog is connected with the overall blogosphere. Our results indicate that companies can reach highly engaged stakeholders via weblogs, however, only a few actors were actually involved into each single discussion. We therefore introduce the concept of online micro-dialogues as proxies for numerous face-to-face communications about similar issues between the company and its stakeholder base and which might be an avenue to better understand how organizations interact online with their stakeholders."

One new set of voices that have emerged come from military web logs (milblogs) produced by members of the military, veterans and their family members. Although censorship of milblogs has increased, one area that remains open for discussion is media bias in coverage of war and military personnel. In this study we investigate milblog reactions to the 2006 incident in Haditha in which soldiers were accused of murdering civilians resulting in substantial press coverage. Did these reactions enrich the marketplace of ideas with information and perspectives not otherwise available? The research reported here queried 2,079 sites listed by milblogging.com, the largest listing of milblogs, to find entries related to the Haditha incident. This study contributes to both empirical investigation of the networked public sphere and perceptions of media bias."

This experiment gauged both candidate choice and level of support from voters in a mock election.

A Study of Media Coverage, Stock Prices, and Trading Volumes in Germany.","The Interplay Between the Media, the Economy, and Regulation","This paper investigates the relationship between media coverage and stock prices as well as trading volumes of eight listed German companies. Research interest does not focus on media effects on individual investors (micro-level), but on stock prices and trading volumes (macro-level). (1) A content analysis of reports from financial websites, newspapers, and television shows about the selected companies and (2) a secondary analysis of the daily chances of closing prices and the trading volumes of these companies were combined in a time-series design. The time-series based on trading days. After ARIMA-modeling each of them, cross-lagged correlations between media time-series and stock time-series were computed. Since the study compares correlation patterns under different conditions, the concept of middle range theories is taken seriously. The results suggest that media coverage rather reflects than shapes the development at stock exchanges. There were almost no hints for a widespread media effect, i.e. an impact on so many investors that it will result in a measurable change of stock prices or trading volumes."

For all of their cultural resonancetheir frequent use in satire, their near synonymy with the idea of disappearing with little or no tracespecifics about the these notices on milk cartons are surprisingly difficult to come by. As many as five billion milk cartons with missing children pictured on their sides were in circulation at one time in the United States. The practice of placing missing children notices on milk cartons grew explosively because of a complex confluence of political and social pressures in 1980s America. These pressures led many, with a wide variety of motives, to invest the phenomenon with meanings and hopes beyond its laudable surface goal of aiding in the return of a particular missing child. These milk carton notices made a peculiar communicative contribution to the public sphere of their time, so understanding these notices as a communicative practice offers insight into both communication and the public sphere."

The IMCNs organizational and technical infrastructure is managed by working groups drawn from individual collectives and connected via dozens of listserves. Still, the majority of activity and control is at the local level. Within this mix of collectivity and autonomy, to what degree to these centers resemble or deviate from each other? Moreover, do individual media centers form a network in name only or is there a broader consistency? Using local Indymedia mission statements as a guide, I present findings from a comparative analysis of all accessible and translatable centers (N=101) to address these questions. My analysis is placed in the larger context of dissentworks theory  developed to explicate new forms of emergent self-organization in digital environments."

Well-funded copyright expansionists, led by commercial interests well-represented by the RIAA and MPAA have decried any digital copying wholesale as piracy. Copyright secessionists (to use the term of legal scholar Peter Jaszi), including James Boyle, Lawrence Lessig and Siva Vaidhyanathan have heroically fought against the encroachments of copyright ownership on traditional balances in copyright, and worked to imagine an information commons, free of the constraints of copyright ownership or, as in Creative Commons or the GPL, using copyright ownership subversively to free up content. Intellectuals concerned with copyright balancing have, however, often ignored the critically-important middle ground of fair use, a judicially-supported doctrine permitting wide latitude to copying of copyrighted work when the public good is greater than the personal harm. This paper argues for renewed scholarly analytic interest in the middle ground, as well as scholarly use of this middle ground."

Message-induced empathy is conceptualized as a perception-action process that consists of affective, cognitive and associative components. Twenty professionally produced public service announcements were used as stimuli messages in a 2 (high vs. low empathy) 2 (anti-smoking vs. drunk-driving) study. The 289 participants were randomly assigned to each cell and watched five PSAs presented in a random sequence. Results from multilevel modeling showed that state empathy has unique contribution to predicting persuasion outcomes above and beyond the individuals affective and cognitive responses to the messages. In addition to a direct effect on persuasion, state empathy also has an indirect effect on persuasion via mitigating psychological reactance. Implications for persuasion, health communication campaigns, and future research were discussed."

Similarly, the enactment of gendered identity through blog content and format has only begun to be examined. Following studies of feminist message boards (Herring et al), this paper uses a popular feminist blog as the focus of a discursive study of trolling and community response. How is ideological and social affinity displayed through comments, and what is the role of the blogger in shaping the community that forms in the comment space? Furthermore, how does this feminist community respond to intentional disruption (trolling), and how does this compare to responses in earlier forms of online social interaction? Ultimately, it seems that the perspective and tone of the blogger, owner of this online space, shapes the social interactions within the comments and her perspective is enacted in absentia when a troll intrudes."

The majority of respondents (56%) reported engagement in a vector control activity, and of those reporting action, 45% reported engagement in more than one activity. Results showed people engaged in more actions if they had greater knowledge of malaria, more mass media exposure to malaria prevention messages, higher socio-economic status, and if they lived in a more urban location in which more people reported engagement in multiple actions. The model predicted 42% of the variance in engagement in multiple prevention behaviors. These findings are discussed in the face of world-wide attention to coordinating pesticide use to slow insecticide resistance."

Television provides a lens into such cultural ideals as people turn to television to determine the important issues, fashion, and lifestyles of a given period. This study investigated how characters used mobile phones in teen and adult television programming; a content analysis was conducted on a sample of four television programs during the November 2008 sweeps period. Results from the study indicate that female characters use the mobile phone more than male characters, female teens were represented using the mobile phone for adverse purposes such as text message bullying; adult characters tend to use the phone for voice, while teen characters used features such as text and picture messaging. Teen series had twice the representation of mobile phone use compared to adult series. The current study advance knowledge about televisions role in portraying mobile phone communication. This is important because these representations are telling pieces of todays culture."

Mobile phones are a privileged site for men and women to perform gender identity as well as a location where the fragility of gender stereotypes becomes apparent.
The aim of this presentation is the mobile phone as a fragile technology, either because technological improvements remediate its original concept as a relational medium or because its social use fosters proximity whilst disclosing the fragility of social relations. It is both a fragile product and produces social fragility. Our focus will be the gendered use of the mobile phone as it is our contention that it further unveils the fragility of gender stereotypes in the relation of women to technology."

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a new scale designed to measure Mobile Phone Communication Competence (MPCC); a principal component factor analysis uncovered the structure and dimensionality of the MPCC measure. Results from the factor analysis identified six constructs: asynchronous messaging, willingness to use, feature selection, comfort with technology, communication efficacy and affect. The relationships of the constructs in the MPCC measure are synthesized in a three-step process of mobile phone communication competence: motivation, application and experience. As such, this study created a method and framework for future mobile phone communication competence discourse and research."

The diffusion of the Short Message Service (SMS) among teenagers is no exception. Typically it gave rise to some concerns about its role in lowering the linguistic competences of the young users of such a technology. More or less shared among parents and teachers, these worries seem to underestimate the great amount of metalinguistic work accomplished by teenagers to create and communicate through mobile phones SMS. The paper draws on data of an ethnographic research on the language created by Italian teenagers to communicate each other via SMS. Analysing the linguistic features and the pragmatic functions of this language, it shows the extraordinary amount of metalinguistic work accomplished by teenagers on their natural language. This work on language is a permanent laboratory for cultural creation and linguistic evolution through which teenagers diffuse the distinctive feature of the contemporary digital revolution in everyday communication: the emergency of a new temporality of writing."

Thinking of relationships as communicative processes (Duck 2007) the study is adopting the concept of Mediatization of communication of all parts of life (Krotz 2001, 2007). Therefore it is looking at the everyday life of families and identifies how media is used by the family members and is structured by the different relationships. A case study was conducted in Germany in which a combination of interviews and communication diaries was realized. The findings show that the adoption and usage of communication media is strongly related to different patterns of mobility within a family although there are idiosyncratic influences as well. Family members relate aspects of flexibilization of coordination and enabling of closeness with the usage of communication media. Although they subjectively reflect ambivalent effects of media on family life."

Relying on data collected in August of 2008 from a random sample of respondents designed to represent Colombias adult urban population, this paper provides evidence that informational uses of ICTs (Internet and mobile phones) are significantly related to expressive participation in the online domain, that result, indirectly through mobilization efforts, in a host of traditional or offline civic and political participatory behaviors. That these relationships occur within the context of a society in crisis suggests that new communication technologies offer an additional pathway to democratic political engagement in such societies.

In the wake of these disasters, people turned to the media to find out what happened and how they could help, contributing $1.8 billion to tsunami relief efforts, compared to $129 million following the Pakistan earthquake. Through content analysis of New York Times, CNN and ""NBC Nightly News"" coverage, this paper examines media-provided mobilizing information (MI), which may have enabled disaster relief. Findings indicate that Pakistan earthquake coverage provided more MI overall, yet tsunami coverage provided more explicit MI. The most basic MI, defined for this study as ""need-level MI,"" was most prevalent, and Web addresses were the most common type of ""location-level MI."" CNN coverage provided the most MI overall. Finally, nonprofit and government officials were the most common sources of MI in news coverage. Implications for media and disaster relief officials are discussed."

Meanwhile new measures of collective preferences have become more precise. Prediction information markets such as the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) and Newsfutures yield more accurate election forecasts than polling. The efficient markets hypothesis predicts market price will be the best predictor due to diminished influence of sentiment or partisanship on judgment. This paper proposes an aggregation model of the information environment for influencing bettors in a prediction market. The information environment for the 2008 presidential election is viewed as strata including the prestige national press, the evening network news, cable news, popular blogs, and late-night comedy. Measures of the information environment include dominance of a news cycle (salience) and direction of coverage (slant). The dependent measure is daily price movement in the IEM presidential election market for the final three months of the campaign."

The results resonate with theoretical expectations of prominent hierarchy-of-influences models. Principal Component Analysis revealed a dimensional structure of influences that consists of six conceptually and empirically distinct domains: political interference, economic imperatives, reference groups, professional conventions, organizational structure and procedural limits. These six dimensions build up a hierarchical structure where organizational and professional influences along with procedural constrains are seen as most powerful limits to the journalists work. The results of the study place the news organization at the center of the complex nexus of influence: it is the place where political and economic influences are filtered, negotiated and redistributed. Cross-country comparison shows that the significance of political interference and economic imperatives does highly depend on the national context."

The paper analyzes modern Egyptian media as a transitional media model, which is currently undergoing many transformations and significant shifts, in addition to exhibiting many unique features and challenging paradoxes. In doing so, it makes three central arguments. First, that modern Egyptian media demonstrate the unique case of transformation without democratization, in other words that the shift towards a larger degree of press freedom has not been equally matched by a large degree of political freedom and actual democratic practice. Second, that the Egyptian case exhibits a distinct form of political parallelism, which is not structured around political parties and parliamentary democracy, rather, it thrives around co-existing, or even conflicting, domains, such as private and public media ownership, authoritarianism and resistance, and official and popular spheres. Third, that the Egyptian media case combines features of both a central and a peripheral media system at the same time, since it plays a leading cultural role within the Arab world, but at the same time it is still behind the media systems in the more developed countries in a number of important ways. Finally, the paper provides some concluding remarks on modern Egyptian media in a comparative context."

New Internet applications facilitate users to upload self-created content. The material involved is generally categorized as user created content (UCC). We investigated the modification of video games as an instance of user created content. Game modding is a (re)creation of game content by amateur users who publish their playable creations online for other players to enjoy. Our research was guided by two questions: who are the modders and why do they take the effort to create and publish mods. In answering the questions we also concentrated on possible differences between genres. We conducted in-depth interview with 15 modders and a quantitative online survey (N = 363). The results showed that modders were predominantly young men who spend almost 9 hous per week on their hobby. The most prominent motives were Entertainment and Community. In contrast to what was argued in earlier analyses of modding, our respondents were not particularly driven by self-marketing. The position of modders of the first person genre was in many cases somewhat different from the other genres (action games, sports games and strategy games). Modders of the FIFA football games were most strongly motivated to recreate game elements to reflect their local context."

The European Communication Monitor (ECM) is an annual study conducted by a trans-national research group, and aims to explore the current developments for communications disciplines, practices and instruments. It is an extensive research project to monitor trends in communication management, analyze the changing framework for the profession driven by European integration and evaluate specific topics of relevance to public relations practice. The paper will introduce methodology and findings and discuss challenges for intercultural research within the European landscape identified during the research process.

Conclusion and comparison with international trends
The result of the ECM 2008 demonstrate some challenges for the development of the profession of public relations and communication management in Europe. First, there is still a gap between the advisory influence of communication experts and their involvement in planning and decision making. Arguably, understanding business processes (i.e. leadership, governance, innovation management, relationship structures, investing and capitalizing on assets) and getting involved in a conclusive way is a major challenge for the profession.
Second, clients in Europe dont have a great dependence on agencies. Findings could point to the fact that agencies investments in continuous education, applied research, and long term cooperation with academic research are still very low in Europe. Moreover, jobs in organizations (in house) are often better paid and may have a higher reputation than their counterparts in agencies. Initiatives on an internal, national or transnational level may change the situation.
Third, data shows that addressing journalists or communicating with other cultures in their own country is less relevant than intercultural communication in internal teams and between/within European or non-European countries. This opens new opportunities for communication professionals, both in organizations and in agencies throughout Europe."

Using empirical data collected in the United States from 28 local newspapers, this study examines the local online market structure of U.S. newspapers. Results show that in the local online market, local newspaper sites compete with national newspaper sites, but not with national television sites or portal sites. It suggests that the local online information market structure of newspaper sites is likely to be an oligopoly, different from the print newspapers monopoly market structure. Important theoretical and practical implications are discussed for future research and for the newspaper industry."
2009-0977,"Monuments, Memory, and Community in Post-Soviet Ukraine",On Community,,,,Paper,"Monuments, Memory, and Community in Post-Soviet Ukraine",On Community,"In the summer of 2007 a strange controversy erupted in the port city of Odessa, Ukraine. As part of the effort to revitalize the city's historic centre, officials erected a monument to Tsarina Catherine II, mythical founder of Odessa. This sparked outrage across the country, as nationalists denounced the move as Russophile nostalgia and the glorification of a foreign despot responsible for crushing Ukraine's autonomy. This incident resonates with another controversy over monuments that took place a few years earlier in the western city of L'viv. Some intellectuals and politicians in this erstwhile part of the Habsburg Empire had argued for the need for a monument to Emperor Franz Josef, while others vigorously opposed this move as self-sabotaging and inappropriate for a fledgling independent state. While the critics of both these monuments rejected them as the work of fifth columns hostile to the new national project, supporters rejected this characterization, arguing that they had no interest in uniting with Russia or the West and merely wanted to commemorate crucial aspects of their own regional histories and identities.

My paper will use these debates as a window onto contemporary discussions of community and identity. While traditionally academic discourse has focused on the national and transnational (imperial) levels of identification and belonging, the contemporary controversies in Ukraine point to the need to theorize local levels of self-understanding and community formation. I will be particularly interested in examining the monument as a site that embodies micro-histories and memories, and constructs local identities and communities."

The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of interactivity within video games on players enjoyment and mood management. To that end, 151 participants completed a mood-manipulation exercise that induced negative mood. Then each either played a Wii boxing game, played a computerized and Flash-driven boxing game, or viewed a DVD clip featuring a boxing match. Results suggested that the Wii game was enjoyed more and was better able to repair negative mood than the other two media contents. Additionally, the findings point to new ways of conceptualizing mood, mood management theory, and enjoyment."
2009-0979,"Moods, Media Preference, and Media Selection","Mood, Emotion and Enjoyment of the Media",,,,Paper,"Moods, Media Preference, and Media Selection","Mood, Emotion and Enjoyment of the Media","This research explores the relationship between moods, personal and general media preference, and media selection. Mood management studies have suggested that when people select media fares to repair their moods, the prevailing tone of the content itself has been the most important factor in selection. But past research has always utilized highly familiar and popular entertainment content, thereby possibly confounding their studies with the variables of personal preference (driven by past exposure). This study seeks to see which is most important to the media-mood repair equation while examining the influence of negative moods, media preference and mood enhancing characteristics of media contents on media choice . The study was based on the experiment which was conducted with 149 college students. Participants were provided with either a choice of a highly popular television comedy and a highly popular television drama or a choice of the same drama and a non-popular television comedy. The results of the study showed that media preference was a more important factor in the media choice than the moods but mood enhancement effects by media consumptions were more related to media characteristics and the initial moods. Media preference, media characteristics and moods worked together for mood changes and enjoyment of the media."
2009-0980,"Moral Communication and Organizational Communication: On the Narrative Construction of ""Social Responsibility""",Corporate Social Responsibility and Organizational Ethics,,,,Paper,"Moral Communication and Organizational Communication: On the Narrative Construction of ""Social Responsibility""",Corporate Social Responsibility and Organizational Ethics,"The purpose of this paper is to discuss the narrative construction of social responsibility through moral communication by analyzing the ways and contexts in which organizations use moral communication to put pressure on actors or repair and defend organizational legitimacy. We bring together communication theory with narrativity and sensemaking theory to account for the process whereby implicit and explicit moral communication is used, how its meaning is socially constructed and changing over time and to analyse the effects of such moral communication on legitimacy. We use this framework to analyse a controversy around safety emerging from a nuclear incident involving a large European energy company. The empirical analysis shows how the rational myth or concept social responsibility shapes controversies and highlights how stakeholders strategically use it to build justifications that aim at influencing the unfolding of the controversy and thus repairing or maintaining legitimacy."
2009-0981,Moral Disengagement for Enjoyments Sake: Judging the Actions of Fictional Characters,Our Relationships With Media Characters,,,,Paper,Moral Disengagement for Enjoyments Sake: Judging the Actions of Fictional Characters,Our Relationships With Media Characters,"This study argues that viewers of violent fictional narratives use moral disengagement strategies (Bandura, 1986) in the maintenance of positive affective dispositions toward fictional characters in order to enjoy the entertainment experience. The study also investigates the concept of latitude of moral sanction (Zillmann, 2000). Male and female participants were presented with a violent narrative in which the protagonist carried out four increasingly violent acts supported by moral cues in the narrative. Viewers were asked to report their moral judgments, disposition level, and enjoyment after each act. Findings indicate that moral disengagement is used to facilitate positive dispositions toward characters, and provides some support for the argument that if viewers of a narrative witness a liked protagonist engaging in a morally questionable act which has been supported by moral disengagement cues, and rate that act as less severe and more justified, and the protagonist as more good than evil, then those viewers have used the moral disengagement strategies that are being encouraged in the narrative."

The moral economies inscribed within games spaces structure basic rules governing acceptable and legitimate forms of play. Within that context, I examine the tensions between individual and community as well as various game mechanics which govern competitive and cooperative play. Through an analysis of several MMOGs, I content that the moral economies of play that subsist in each of these games gives rise to radically different notions of ludic economies as well as broader value systems which account for emergent economies and currencies as well as different models for citizenship within each of these game worlds."
2009-0983,More Than Just a Game: Competence Goals and Video Game Playing Motivation,Game Studies: Impacts and Influences,,,,Paper,More Than Just a Game: Competence Goals and Video Game Playing Motivation,Game Studies: Impacts and Influences,"Except in the rarest of cases, video games provided the player with some sort of goals for the players to pursue and achieve. In addition to the specific tasks they may pursue within the game, however, video game players are also motivated by larger goals, such as improving their general video game playing competence, demonstrating their competence, or trying to avoid demonstrating their incompetence. The present study examined the impact of such competence goals and their relationship to motivation and found, in an experiment with undergraduate, female, participants, mastery orientation to be positively associated with video game playing motivation. This paper also discusses implications and suggestions for future research."

Portrayals of Masculinity in Police and Detective Programs Over Time","The Feminine, Masculine, and Sports","This study examines changes over time in depictions of masculinity as seen in the ever-popular police and detective television drama. Drawing a random sample of episodes from an exhaustive list of top-rated police and detective dramas from the inception of television to the turn of the millennium, the analysis examines whether representations of key aspects of masculinity have shifted or remained the same. A total of 206 major male characters were coded. The findings show that although male characters are frequently physically and occasionally verbally aggressive, they have also generally become more emotionally expressive and sensitive over time. They also less frequently engage in such risky behaviors as smoking and reckless driving in recent decades. Differences occurred, however, for many aspects of masculine depictions according to the race and social class of the character. Overall, many traditional and even hegemonic depictions of masculinity remain in the genre at the same time that other more progressive depictions are apparent in recent decades. Furthermore, the 1990s seem to show regression back to more traditional portrayals."
2009-0985,Moroccan Media in a Democratic Transition,Media Policy in Transition: Comparative Cases,,,,Paper,Moroccan Media in a Democratic Transition,Media Policy in Transition: Comparative Cases,"A core assumption of much of the literature on media in developing countries is that a more independent press with greater freedom will make a positive contribution to political change. In Morocco, a democratic transition started in 1997, when the opposition socialist party came to power and led the government. The new governments mission was to enact political reforms that aimed at promoting human rights, civil liberties, an open and pluralist media, and at establishing the rule of law. Using Morocco as a case study, this paper examines the interplay between media policy, media institutions, and the government. To evaluate the nature of the political role of media in democratic transitions requires close scrutiny of three major factors: the legal, the economic, and the political environments. This paper first examines the media policy as enacted in the Constitution, the Press Law, and the Audiovisual Communication Law. Second, the paper provides a careful and detailed examination of the economic and political environments and addresses the issues of ownership and the degree of political control over the content of news media and the government's tendency to use media policy to limit the media's ability to operate. One important outcome of this research is that it will help determine whether Morocco's democratic reforms are meaningful reforms, or just empty attempts to pacify domestic and international public opinion."

Sixteen mothers with infants or toddlers who were beginning participation in an intergenerational learning program targeting low-income families completed the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI; Milner, 1986) when they initially enrolled in the program. A family worker associated with the program visited each familys home during the same week and administered the Infant-Toddler HOME Inventory (Caldwell & Bradley, 1984), a 45-min interview and observation system that assesses the quality of the home environment as a context for childrens cognitive and social development. Total scores from the CAPI and HOME Inventories were inversely associated (r = .67), as were several of the subscales from the two measures. Results indicate that the degree to which mothers endorse beliefs that typify physically abusive parents is associated with the type of parenting, predictability of care, and cognitive stimulation that their young children experience at home."

One way to increase motivation is through the use of guilt appeals; yet, message designers must be aware of the potential negative consequences of employing messages that induce too much guilt. The current project seeks to differentiate the consequences of using guilt appeals from actually increasing feelings of guilt in the public. In a field experiment we investigate the use of guilt appeals within the context of disaster preparedness, with a nationally representative sample, to enhance attitudes, increase risk perceptions, and motivate behavioral intentions to prepare."

Twenty-two participants navigated Amazon.com while their on-screen activity and physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance, and facial EMG) was recorded. Results showed that the process of shopping on Amazon is best characterized as a series of transitions between general category pages (i.e. computers) and specific product pages (i.e. Apple Macbook Air). Physiological data suggest that the onset of specific pages elicit cardiac orienting responses, but the onset of general pages do not. Skin conductance data indicated that sympathetic activation diminished during the course of both general and specific pages. Facial EMG data indicated that the process of navigating general pages was more unpleasant than the process of navigating specific pages. These results are introduced in terms of the LC4MP as well as the distinction between getting there and being there."
2009-0989,"Motivations, Impression Management, and Self-Disclosure in Social Network Sites",Online Disclosure and Nondisclosure,,,,Paper,"Motivations, Impression Management, and Self-Disclosure in Social Network Sites",Online Disclosure and Nondisclosure,"The present study examines the extent to which the motivations for relationship maintenance and development, impression management, self-disclosure, and perceived reciprocity affect intimacy among users of a social network site, Facebook. Using data from an online survey of Facebook users (N = 249), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that the motivations, impression management, self-disclosure amount, and perceived reciprocity increase intimacy in Facebook. The study also found that the motivation for relationship development negatively affects self-disclosure honesty. Self-disclosure honesty in turn did not have a significant impact on intimacy, suggesting that users are reluctant to reveal their true selves when they initiate new relationships through the social network site. The theoretical implication and limitations of the study were also discussed."
2009-0990,"Movies, Meaning, and Social Influence: A Developmental-Interactionist Theory of Film Communication",Narrative Persuasion,,,,Paper,"Movies, Meaning, and Social Influence: A Developmental-Interactionist Theory of Film Communication",Narrative Persuasion,"This research seeks to develop an empirically relevant model of the film communication process, with particular attention to the ways authors use film media to convey messages to an audience. Prior research from both film and communication disciplines is examined and critiqued, with particular attention to the limitations of Worths model of film communication. A new model of film communication is advanced from a developmental-interactionist perspective, labeling film communication as containing channels of comprehension (cognitive) and empathy (emotional,) with an integrative attitude dimension. Developmental-interactionism is then used to discuss the evolutionary basis of pro-social behavior, including paradoxes of conformity, and the function and behavior of groups with respect to the arts and specifically film. An experiment is then conducted to examine the effects of group interpretation on the posed dimensions of film communication.
Results suggest that group interpretation of a film increases levels of comprehension, yet decreases levels of director-to-viewer empathy and attitude-based evaluations of the film. A critical relationship between viewer empathy and viewer attitude towards film suggests the dominance of the emotional stream of communication in the process of film appreciation. Audience employment of segmentation technique to denote relevant material within the stimulus reveals familiar patterns in the viewing process and audience attention. Ramifications for understanding broader patterns of film viewing and filmmaking, and conundrums of cognitive understanding and emotional relation are discussed."

The Importance of Popular Media in Everyday Girl Culture,"Popular Media, Identity, and Everyday Life","This paper investigates the importance of popular media in everyday life, more specifically in everyday girl culture. Based on eight months of ethnographic research in 8th form [8th grade, ages 11-12], it explores the role of media in an everyday setting: the classroom. The study is informed by two central research questions: how do girls use media in the classroom, and how important are media to their everyday life? It aims to provide an empirical, theoretical and methodological contribution to existing literature. First, it empirically contributes to our knowledge of everyday media use in general and in the school context specifically. Second, it adds to theory about audiences, more precisely about the medias role in identity practices. Third, it shows how different methods produce different results about the importance of media."

Yet, their educational impact remains largely an untested assumption. This study aimed to connect two specific properties of serious games with their educational outcomes. In particular, this study examined the impact of multimodality and interactivity on multidimensional measures of educational outcomes through a partial 2 (interactive, non-interactive) x 3 (high, moderate and low in multimodality) factorial between-subjects follow-up experiment. Results showed that both multimodality and interactivity contribute to educational outcomes individually. Implications and future research directions are also discussed."

The theory of the public highlights the political effect of multi-site videoconferencing and how the technology contributes to the well-being of the community. To analyze the political effects of videoconferencing, the paper describes a case of the community use of multi-site videoconferencing based on video analysis and semi-structured interviews. The case occurred in 2007 and connected a number of First Nation communities across Canada for simultaneous audio-visual exchange. K-Net Services in Ontario hosted the meeting to gauge the feasibility of public meetings through videoconferencing and to document an example of community uses of the technology. K-Net Services works to develop their videoconferencing infrastructure as a public space. Our findings suggest K-Nets activities have developed a media institution best understood as a counter-public sphere for their service region. The case meeting shows a potential new opportunity to further integrate videoconferencing into community development."

Of the total time audiences spent with media, about 53% (survey data) to 66% (diary data) is devoted to multitasking and also about 16% (diary data) to 22% (survey data) is devoted to multiple media use. Consistent across diary and survey studies, combining the Internet with audio media and combining the Internet with television were the most frequently observed multiple media combinations among adolescents. In both diary and survey studies, audio media were frequently combined with traveling, doing homework, or social interaction; television was frequently combined with eating or doing homework; and the Internet was frequently combined with homework. The survey data further suggest that sensation seeking and having television and Internet access in ones own bedroom were positive predictors of multitasking. Our experimental research (Zhang, Jeong, & Fishbein, 2006) suggests that when students multitask with television while performing a cognitive task, their recall of television content as well as their task performance are reduced.

It concludes that mumblecore must be understood as an art form determined by the social conditions of the early 21st century, particularly the new technologies of the web. These conditions distinguish mumblecore from previous forms of realism in film: it displays what is described as a digital aesthetic, visual cues related to digital culture, through what the author calls networked film, cinema producing connections between the audience and the film and even among the filmmakers."

In two studies, photographs of participants were inserted in an advertisement, and evaluation scores were measured and compared for advertisements displaying the participant and advertisements displaying an unfamiliar other person. Results demonstrate that photo self-endorsing generates higher levels of self-referencing and more positive evaluations of the brand and advertisement than photo other-endorsing. Moreover, when compared to a text self-endorsing advertisement that replaces the endorser with advertising copy incorporating the second person pronoun you, photo self-endorsing still generates a higher level of self-referencing and more positive evaluations."

Facebook: A Digital Enactment of Class-Based Social Categories Amongst American Teenagers,Youth and Communication Technology: The Role of Social Network Sites in the Lives of Young People,"During the 2006-2007 school year, American teenagers flocked to two distinct social network sites: MySpace and Facebook. The division was by no means clean, as plenty of teens adopted both or neither. Yet, in choosing which social network site(s) to adopt, teens reproduced their everyday social networks and began marking digital turf. Their choice was neither arbitrary nor geographically delimited and distinctions existed in every school and community in which I interviewed teens. In examining teens' descriptions of who preferred MySpace from those who preferred Facebook, I found that teens often went beyond identity and taste markers, using the language of social categories, race, and class to make distinctions. The adoption patterns that unfolded between MySpace and Facebook reproduced and publicly displayed social and structural divisions that are a part of everyday teen life. The goal of this paper is to locate the digital distinctions that emerged in a broader discourse of teenage social categories, leveraging ethnographic data to make sense of how teens understood the split that was taking place."

Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,,,,Paper,Myths and Truths About Readers Interaction With Complex Visual Documents,What You See is What You Get? Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,"Newspapers and net papers are examples of complex multimodal documents consisting of texts, pictures and graphics. Although we encounter such documents in our everyday life, there is still little empirical evidence about how these formats are processed by readers. In our paper, we discuss myths about readers interaction with complex visual documents from the perspective of contrary empirical evidence. Eye tracking methodology and retrospective verbal protocols are used to reveal in detail the nature of attentional and cognitive processes underlying reception of complex documents. We will focus on attentional guidance and text-picture integration; general page-inherent reading paths vs. individual reading styles; and on the role of layout and media.

From the common explanations of immigration officials engaging in novel orthography as they completed forms, to families altering their names to make them easier for their neighbours to pronounce, a range of dominant cultural influences were at work. Today, these forces continue; they are evident in such techno-bureaucratic minutiae as maximum character lengths for permanent residents names, and in the decade-long policy encouraging people with the religiously-significant Sikh names Kaur and Singh to remove these names before applying to immigrate (CBC, July 2007). They are also heard in day-to-day introductions as some newcomers choose to use common English or French names to present themselves, and to potentially make themselves more employable (Ng et al., 2007).

With these and other scenarios in mind I ask, in what ways and through what means do minority culture members and migrants to Canada change their names? What roles do legislation, policy and state regulated data collection procedures have in these shifts? How are names altered through less official interactions? What implications do these name changes have for Canada as a nation-state? What are the outcomes in terms of nationalism or cultural pluralism?"

This study looks at the relationship between the Internet, especially the blogosphere, and ideology to support that ideology can be confirmed in the Internet.
This research has demonstrated that the phenomenon of Doenjang-Nyeo in South Korea has played a role in creating and reinforcing a false consciousness in which certain men can blame women for what they perceive as their own lack of success in a capitalist system. This system maintains the male-dominated society in this sense: It can be expected that any women who attain positions of power in institutions which have historically been controlled by men will be those who adopt traditional patriarchal values. In this sense, the newly-coined word Doenjang-Nyeo serves to perpetuate a system of control."

I treat sci-fi as an enabling genre for diverse social groups to communicate together and develop alternative ethical discourses that are limited in scope or invisible to multiple social groups. The discipline spanning nature of sci-fi enables a negotiation of the promises and problematics of nanotech between scientists, social scientists, humanities scholars, authors and the public. Specific considerations are: 1) Can sci-fi act as a means of broadening discussions and removing impediments of ethical behavior by introducing more discursive tools into scientific practice and education and 2) what can we learn from comparisons of sci-fi and scientific output between biotechnology and nanotechnology in terms of what research directions are taken within science and what the outputs of this research becomes accepted by the public."

The results showed that (1) In general, people spent more time reading statistical messages while elaborated more on exemplar messages; (2) elaboration, as a form of deep information processing, had a negative effect on outcome expectancy; (3) elaboration of health messages did not depend on peoples prior health behavior in exemplar group, whereas in statistics group, the more people binge drink in the past, the more people elaborated. The study concluded that narrative messages with exemplars can reduce the likelihood of audience members dismissing health messages and increase peoples attention to the messages by arousing elaborations of the messages, regardless of peoples prior health habits. Relevant implications were discussed."
2009-1003,Narrative Rehearsal of Norm Violation Scripts: Expanding the Methodological Repertoire of Cultivation Research,Above and Beyond? A Look at Uncharted Processes in Media Effects Research,,,,Paper,Narrative Rehearsal of Norm Violation Scripts: Expanding the Methodological Repertoire of Cultivation Research,Above and Beyond? A Look at Uncharted Processes in Media Effects Research,"This paper proposes an alternative view on cultivation that is based on a narrative approach. Fictional narratives in television often revolve around norm violations  as central conflicts, and micro sequences of action and reaction. Norm violations are connected to a narrative evaluation, such as rewards, sanctions, and character transition. Through processes of identification and emotional engagement, viewers intuitively understand norm violations in a direct and intensive experience. Given the stereotypical nature of many television narratives, a multitude of examples for norm violations may solidify into typical event schemas (norm violation scripts). From a cultivation perspective, repeated exposures (specifically highly engaged exposures) may lead to the adoption of these scripts. Narrative vignettes are proposed as a method to test such cultivation effects. They offer written descriptions reflecting scenarios from television narratives and give respondents the opportunity to react to them. Different ways of implementing narrative vignettes into cultivation studies are discussed and examples are presented."

The narrative messages are designed such that they are counterfactual producing stories, this is, stories in which the protagonist suffers negative consequences for engaging in risky behaviors. The study also explores the effect of including, or not, statistical information about populations at risk for foodborne illnesses. 160 participants were randomly assigned to read a message that was either informative or narrative, included or not statistical information about food safety risk, and was about either using clean utensils or a food thermometer to check for meat being properly cooked. Results show that stories that induce counterfactual thought are not as succesful in the context of food safety as they have been in other risk domains, and that the inclusion of statistical information before them does not increase their persuasiveness. Implications for the use of narrative forms in food safety messages are discussed."
2009-1005,Narrative TV Commercials: Identification and Appreciation,Keywords in Information Systems: Narrative (High Density),,,,Paper,Narrative TV Commercials: Identification and Appreciation,Keywords in Information Systems: Narrative (High Density),"Creative strategies for TV commercials are traditionally regarded as expressing either a rational or an emotional appeal. In this paper evidence is presented for a separate third category: narrative TV commercials. In narrative TV commercials, appeals are expressed indirectly. For instance, narrative TV commercials do not contain directly expressed rational appeals like sales propositions, nor emotional appeals like warm feelings towards the product. Instead, transportation in the story and identification with characters enhance involvement. In Study 1, a framework of TV commercial genres is verified by statistical reconstruction from a TV commercials content analysis (NTV commercials=104). Four meta-genres were construed. Two of them were identified as having rational and emotional appeal; The other two were identified as narrative. In Study 2, audience effects of the construed meta-genres were established in an extensive appreciation survey (NRespondents=3472). The appreciation pattern for one of the two narrative meta-genres confirmed the presumed indirect appeal."

Someone was shooting at the Jokela School Centre in Tuusula, in the South of Finland. Nine people were killed, including the shooter Pekka-Eric Auvinen (18), who committed suicide after he had killed the principal, the school nurse and six students, some of them his classmates. The news of the Jokela tragedy broke immediately all over the country, and soon all over the world. In contemporary societies the media plays a key role in our understanding of a crisis. The media marks an event as a disaster and sets it apart from everyday life by selecting, recording, representing and recycling particular aspects of the event. Through this process the media transforms an event into a recognizable pattern of culture. By providing a communicative space for common codes and symbols, the media offers the audience the possibility to become conscious of the meta-level of the disaster  its imaginaire social with all its ambiguity. In this article I will analyse the dynamics of the Jokela media disaster. My question is the following: how was the disaster constructed in the Finnish media during the first couple of days? Special emphasis is given to the analysis of the visual narration of the event. The empirical data covers the Finnish print, electronic and online media from the first two days."

It analyses an increasing role of the Internet in mobilizing global Chinese, how nationalism is increasingly performed and constructed around media(ted ) events, and how diasporas participate in a kind of distributed nationalism. The article is situated in the larger context of the Tibetan protests, perceived Western media biases, and recent nationalism in China. I argue that the Internet plays an important role in mobilizing Chinese diasporas and producing global Chineseness by blurring national boundaries and connecting netizens within and outside China. I also contend that nationalism among diasporas is largely reactive to perceived Western media biases, an embarrassing experience of the torch relay, perceived aggressions of Tibetan supporters, and diasporas daily experience of prejudice and difficulties in the West. Chinese diasporas are thus produced in a complex interaction of global and local politics. Dispersal itself does not automatically lead to cosmopolitanism, but rather diasporic communities can be transnational in form but national in content."

As a member of the IOM study committee, I was one of several members who briefed Congress and the media on the report. As part of our committee work we were prepped for the media interviews, including a recommendation not to talk about the research in great detail but in broad brushstrokes. The involvement in publicizing the IOM report can serve as a case study for learning of the ways researchers can make their work sought after by the media and relevant to the general public. This case study can also illustrate how one researcher speaks for a collaborative project."

This paper traces the developments of the last 25 years - those both real and apocryphal- in an attempt to provide a grounded examination of the genuine and imagined threats upon this programming that provides a reflection and record of the events of the day. It also considers some of the attributes of news and the ways in which the technologies of the post-network era create opportunities to redefine the experience of video news.

To do that, the paper sets out to accomplish two goals. Fist, it offers an extensive overview of the current terrain of scholarly writing on the topic of nation branding as it has emerged across several disciplines, including marketing, political science and international relations, and media and cultural studies. For the purposes of this review, 180 publications were examined, ranging from scholarly articles to book-length studies and published between 1998 and January 2008. The second goal of the paper is to tease out important themes that emerge throughout the literatures and to outline theoretical dimensions along which communication scholars can develop a critical research agenda on nation branding. The paper concludes by arguing that such a critical agenda can benefit from bringing to bear materialist theories of social change and reproduction to the analysis of nation branding."

While this no doubt happens, socio-emotional selectivity theory suggests youth are increasingly motivated develop new peer relationships that act as new sources of knowledge. Mobile phone e-mail may allow Japanese youth the opportunity to more actively navigate these increasingly large and complex networks. Using this theory we hypothesize that frequency of mobile phone e-mail increases with age, personal network size, and network complexity. To examine these hypotheses we draw on survey data collected from 1,317 youth aged 8 - 16 years living in Tokyo, Japan. Our multivariate analysis shows strong positive influence of age and network size on mobile phone e-mail use. Network complexity -- operationalized as connecting to peers in a variety of social settings, through involvement in multiple clubs and other extracurricular activities -- was not significantly associated with frequent use of mobile phone e-mail. When taken together these findings show that rather than limiting social horizons, mobile phone e-mail plays a significant role in the lives of young Japanese by affording them the opportunity to navigate large social networks as they mature."
2009-1013,Negotiating control: Power and strategic communication in postcommunist countries,Political Communication in Transitional Democracies - A Global Perspective,,,,Paper,Negotiating control: Power and strategic communication in postcommunist countries,Political Communication in Transitional Democracies - A Global Perspective,"After the demise of communist rule the relationship between journalists and politicians has been characterized by dramatic confrontations, often dubbed media wars. Continuous political interference into news making on the one hand, and aggressive reporting and lack of objectivity on the other have created an unusually high level of conflict and hostility between political officials and the media. Based on elite interviews in Bulgaria and Poland the paper explores how journalists and politicians understand their relationship past and present and what the unwritten rules are that govern their day-to-day interactions. The findings suggest that in Bulgaria closed-knitted networks between the two sets of actors continue to shape political communication breeding deals and even corruption that seriously undermine the independence of political journalism. In contrast, political communication roles in Poland appear more differentiated making it more difficult for political actors to exercise control over the public agenda. Political actors have therefore embarked on developing a more strategic approach to news management by adopting tools that have been employed in western political campaigns."

Based on 375 interviews conducted in both communities, the authors discuss issues of adaptation, identity and networking with the American and local community. Findings present a more nuanced picture as compared to the isolated and disconnected enclaves of British and Swedish retirees living in the Mediterranean coasts of Spain, Algarve (Portugal) or Tuscany (Italy). Contact with the local community via charity work or attendance to specific activities seems to be more relevant in the Mexican locations as compared with the findings of European studies. Similarly, retirees efforts to learn Spanish also seem higher in comparison with data reported for British retirees living in Spain, Portugal or Italy. This picture of seemingly integration becomes more complex with the analysis of open-ended narratives. Subtle in-group tensions among U.S. residents as well as contradictory evaluations of the Mexican culture need to be discussed against the backdrop of U.S.-Mexican relations and the power status differential between these two nations. The applicability of acculturation theory to understand retirees adaptation is discussed in this paper as well as the emergent conceptualizations that define this new type of migration."

While confirming most existing research on how mainstream media reproduces racial stereotypes, this paper will first discuss the representation of ethnic minorities in mainstream Hong Kong news media. The analysis will include the case of a TV star, Gil Mohandepaul Singh (who is nicknamed Q Bo Bo) , who made it in the Hong Kong celebrity industry. On the other hand, through interviews with ethnic minority subjects from India, Nepal, Pakistan and Indonesia, the paper discusses how ethnic minorities negotiate their own identity through consumption of local Chinese media in which ethnic representation is minimal. The paper will end by examining how these ethnic minority residents make use of the internet to retrace their cultural roots and building of an imagined community."

2009-1018,Neoliberalism and Space: Privatizing Intergovernmental Satellite Organizations,Liberalization and Policy Reform: International Perspectives,,,,Paper,Neoliberalism and Space: Privatizing Intergovernmental Satellite Organizations,Liberalization and Policy Reform: International Perspectives,"The application of neo-liberal principles to the telecommunications sector has been accompanied by the privatization and restructuring of the worlds most prominent intergovernmental satellite organizations, namely, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) and the International Mobile Satellite Organization (INMARSAT). The enactment in March 2000 of U.S. legislation, the Open-market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act or ORBIT Act, set forth specific criteria relating to the privatization of INTELSAT and INMARSAT. The ORBIT Act fundamentally altered these intergovernmental treaty arrangements, transforming these intergovernmental satellite organizations into private corporate enterprises, owned, no longer by governments and by extension, citizens, but by private equity firms.

The privatization of the two organizations is structurally similar in that intergovernmental agencies were created to ensure that the private companies adhere to public service standards. Methodologically, the comparative case study is employed, as this research analyzes the structural and ownership alterations of both INMARSAT and INTELSAT. It also seeks to address some of the implication of these changes for developing states which remain dependent on these organizations to meet their telecommunications needs. In the context of international regime change, this work critically examines the process of privatizing INTELSAT and INMARSAT and post-privatization developments as well as the ability of the intergovernmental agencies to effectively oversee their respective charge."
2009-1019,Neoliberalism and the Diminution of Public Broadcasting,What's Left of Public Service? Retheorizing a Key Concept in Media Studies,,,,Paper,Neoliberalism and the Diminution of Public Broadcasting,What's Left of Public Service? Retheorizing a Key Concept in Media Studies,"The tenets of neoliberalism have informed the deregulatory approach to public policy and the rejection of public broadcasting. Following Michel Foucault, we need to recognize neoliberalism as a whole way of being and thinking, an attempt to create an enterprise society through the pretense that the latter is a natural (but never-achieved) state of affairs, even as competition is imposed as a framework of regulating everyday life in the most subtly comprehensive statism imaginable. The neoliberal right is winning struggles enacted over culture, sometimes in concert with the cultural-studies leftwhen valorizing difference as a marketing conceptand sometimes in concert with the reactionary right, when making nationalism into a cultural and commercial norm. But media policy has not come to the defense of public broadcasting as a challenge to neoliberalism  rather, public broadcasting has been recast as a technology of self-improvement operating under market-like rhetorics."

Interpersonal networks and shared media usage patterns can help us understand public opinion in conflict situations.
Traditional communication channels (face to face, tribal councils) and media perform important functions in conflict situations. Both channels disseminate information that people use to make decisions.

The question is: how can we evaluate the impact and value of these different channels? This paper identifies ways that network analysis can be used to better understand how individuals and organizations in conflict situations use different channels of communication to make sense of their environment. This final paper draws upon the first three papers to make this argument and highlight practical applications of network theory.

This paper ties the earlier three papers together and provides a macro perspective to understand the findings of the research. It also provides future directions for this type of public opinion research in conflict situations.

Existing in the borderlands between discursive domains, they also increasingly are straddling the space between television and the internet. This paper examines the ways in which these two forms of alternative news are migrating between media technologies. It argues that like many kinds of television in a digital age, they are being reconceptualized, no longer programs, but assemblages of content that itself is fluid, transportable, and most importantly, open to reappropriation by an audience equipped with ever-more sophisticated technological capabilities. As such, this paper offers a case study of the changing nature of news, its distribution patterns, and its relationship to its audience within an emerging information landscape marked by the uneasy tension between the top-down dissemination of news and opinion, and the horizontal circulation of information, argument, and political culture itself."

Predictably, the argument will not bring peoples (including others) any progressive development of cosmopolitan democracy in the name of a this-as-well-as-that principle as proposed by Beck in his construct of cosmopolitan society that cannot reveal properly the characteristics of both social inclusion and exclusion like Castells network society. Becks highly routinized and Eurocentric conceptions of risk society and cosmopolitan society fail to criticize the western-state-based global intervention and to make the interactions among the states and nonstate actors successfully for global governance and communication in terms of justice, human dignity and equalities. Indeed, other than terrorist attacks, we should not underestimate many other global risks such as global warming, food deficiency, poverty, youth problems and other social inequalities in contemporary, complex, postmodern society. This paper suggests an emphasis on philosophical, sociological, theoretical and empirical studies of a networked risk society that should envisage the presence of socially excluded others. Only just interactions among global state and nonstate actors and such excluded others may monitor, as well as hopefully fix, network risks in contemporary societies by means of global governance and communication, leading to an egalitarian society of global justice."
2009-1023,Network Performance: Sociocultural Aspects of Playing Music Over the Internet,Communication and Technology (CAT) Poster Session,,,,Paper,Network Performance: Sociocultural Aspects of Playing Music Over the Internet,Communication and Technology (CAT) Poster Session,"Advances in high-speed networks, digital sound production, and computer-mediated communication systems are transforming the basic practices of music production and performance. Emerging technological practices range from asynchronous remixing of online music content to synchronous performances among geographically dislocated musicians. Musicians creating and playing music together over networks affords opportunities for mixing musical cultures, acoustic environments and performance practices. These network performances provide a way to evaluate some of the most salient features of a network society wherein individuals use communication technologies to enact and transform social practices across space and time.

In this paper, we present a limited exploratory investigation into the social, cultural, and technological factors involved in the performance of music over networks. Temporal and spatial concerns are central to understanding the various technical challenges and opportunities that performers face while performing with other peers over the internet. Based on an initial case study and qualitative interviews of network performers we both describe and critique the global, collaborative, and participatory dimensions of network performance."

Micro radio activists successfully leveraged the then emerging Internet and other digital technologies to further their cause. By doing so, participants developed new modes of organization and repertoires of action unique to the new interface between analog and digital worlds. In exploring this phenomenon, I developed dissentworks theory  describing how collective action emerges within digital environments. I offer his approach as a tool to reassess the impacts of an infrastructural approach to media based dissent collective action."

As distribution platforms have become more broadly disbursed, the networks have attempted to exploit these properties in non-traditional ways, moving beyond the ephemeral performance or show aspect of talk show programming to using new distribution platforms as a means of extended audience engagement with the network brand. The networks have used morning program content to build on-line communities, and used video snippets of late-night talk to create a different kind of water-cooler moment. While talk shows still retain an important place and role as profitable and popular programming dayparts, they are also important network tools for expanding programming (and the accompanying advertising) into consumers lives in profoundly new ways."

Emotional faces used in this study are varied in two ways commonly used in media, the first, called type varies whether the face is a human face or an animal face and the second, called form, varies whether the face is photographic or cartoon like. To date there has been little comparative study of whether these different types of faces elicit the same or different patterns of neural activation. For the experiment, each subjects FFA, Amygdala, and STS were indentified on the functional localizer scan. The FFA was defined as the set of all continuous voxels in the fusiform gyrus that showed significant difference in activity comparing faces to houses. Because the localizer data were used to independently define the FFA region of interest for experimental fMRI scans, no correction for multiple voxel-wise comparisons was made. The same procedure was made to define Amygdala and STS. Each subjects predefined FFA, Amygdala, and STS were then used to extract the time course of the magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity during the experimental fMRI scans.
Preliminary results showed that there was a significant difference of BOLD activation in FFA, Amygdala, and STS found among valence levels of facial expressions. In addition, amygdala and STS activated differently to different types (animal and human) and forms (cartoon and real photographic) of faces."
2009-1027,New Journalism on the Web: A Comparison of Hyper-Local Citizen Sites to Traditional Media Sites,News and Citizen Participation,,,,Paper,New Journalism on the Web: A Comparison of Hyper-Local Citizen Sites to Traditional Media Sites,News and Citizen Participation,"Traditional media landscapes are in flux for journalists today. Media outlets are facing major losses in advertising revenue and intense competition from online products such as citizen journalist sites. These citizen journalists arent always trained in the same conventions and norms as professionals but are now shaping both news and relationships in the journalistic realm. This study compares hyper-local citizen journalism sites with traditional media sites in the same geographic areas to determine how the hyper-local sites differ in terms of thematic content, objectivity and watchdog functions. The author finds that thematically, both traditional and hyper-local citizen sites have similar levels of political coverage. Also, hyper-local sites carry more opinion-oriented news than traditional sites. In addition, hyper-local sites seem to be very interested in carrying out the watchdog function of the press, especially in terms of local government, and commit few incidents of boosterism."

They make it possible to maintain social relationships with existing friends and family, while at the same time building new relationships on campus. The social lives of American freshmen, however, are profoundly different from the lives of Flemish freshman. While the transition from high school to university life for American freshmen often involves a large geographic distance between their high school/neighbourhood friends, Flemish freshmen retain a close geographical distance to their friends. Consequently, American freshmens social life might benefit more from using communication technologies to build new relationships, while Flemish freshmens social life might benefit more from using communication technologies to maintaining existing relationships.
This paper reports the results of a survey study among American (N=198) and Flemish freshmen (N=326) at the beginning of the academic year. The results indicate that both for American and Flemish freshmen calling, texting, instant messaging and emailing more frequently with ones existing social network of friends is associated with a higher sense of belongingness to a strong and supportive social network. Calling, texting and instant messaging more frequently to ones new social network, however, is only associated with an increased sense of belongingness for American freshmen. Emailing to ones new social network is associated with a decrease in belongingness."

Public service in radio/TV broadcasting prioritized universal access and a common public experience informed by corporate liberal governance for commercial systems and social democratic for public systems. Neo-liberalism guided cable television as a consumer choice for those willing to pay for specialty programs. And a libertarian ethos informed public service ideals in network computing through a counterculturalist movement looking for liberty from government and corporations. But social movements have constructed alternative forms of public service, such as the cable access movement which called for citizen rights to local access, production subsidy and municipal governance, and the free software movement. Id like the roundtable to discuss how we might learn from these more democratic and collectivist conceptions of public service in our deliberation over the future of public service media."

Researchers conducted surveys and focus groups in targeted neighborhoods, examining access to new media, community participation, and activism of community residents. Researchers also conducted interviews and focus groups with community activism leaders to determine if and how activists are reaching out to community residents.
Researchers found that nearly 75 % of residents in minority neighborhoods have a computer at home. Of these, approximately 80 % are able to access the internet at home, about half use a dial-up connection, while about half use a high-speed connection. Fewer than one-quarter of the residents visited the public library to access the internet."
2009-1031,New Paths: Exploring Mobile-Centric Internet Use in South Africa,Mobile2.0: Beyond Voice?,,,,Paper,New Paths: Exploring Mobile-Centric Internet Use in South Africa,Mobile2.0: Beyond Voice?,"The title of this workshop, beyond voice, is illustrative of one of the central questions currently surrounding mobile communication in the developing world. Put simply, there is a great deal of enthusiasm around the notion that a large group of users will access the internet for the first time via data enabled mobile handsets. Recent estimates from India, for example (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, 2007), suggest there may be more mobile Internet connections than traditional PC Internet connections operational in the country. Concurrently, high-end smart phones promise browsing experiences which are steadily closing the gaps in speed and ease of use which have hampered earlier incarnations of the mobile internet, such as WAP.
But the raw enthusiasm, the aggregate statistics, and the glossy marketing images from the top-end of handset markets fail to capture the reality of mobile internet use in the developing world. The crux of this papers argument is that the research community knows comparatively little about this supposed community of users who access and use the Internet exclusively via mobile phones. We know little about who they are, how they discover and access the mobile internet, and how the mobile internet fits into their lives.
This paper reports on ongoing qualitative/exploratory research in low income communities in urban South Africa. Through convenience and snowball sampling, the researchers have sought out early adopters among mobile-only internet users. The analysis of the interviews will delineate and describe distinctive new paths to Internet use that largely bypass PCs. We draw on a domestication approach (Haddon, 2003; Hahn & Kibora, 2008; Silverstone & Hirsch, 1992) to move beyond an adoption or diffusion paradigm and to complement aggregate statistical perspectives.
As exploratory research, this project cannot definitively identify all the new paths to the internet, nor the relative frequency with which individuals choose these paths. However, early findings will illustrate current and emerging practices in mobile-only internet use, as well as opportunities and constraints for policymakers interested in promoting or leveraging internet use among a much broader community of the worlds inhabitants"
2009-1032,News as a Looking Glass: Shame and Mediated Exposure,"Media, Emotion, and Order",,,,Paper,News as a Looking Glass: Shame and Mediated Exposure,"Media, Emotion, and Order","This paper is concerned with the rift between mediated representations and the moral feeling of shame that people experience when they are denied respect (Honneth 2007). Acknowledging the social nature of shame that presupposes the others regard for oneself and drawing on Cooleys (1983 [1902]) concept of the looking glass self to describe the monitoring of the self from the point of view of the others, the paper argues that news is a looking glass through which viewers mirror themselves. Apart from heightening the awareness of the others gaze and expectations, news becomes a looking glass in a more literal way. This occurs in the instances of mediated exposure when people find themselves inadvertently in the news. After a theoretical discussion of the emotion of shame, the paper concentrates on a particular example of mediated exposure drawing on a larger ethnography of news consumption in London. Experiences of shame are then compared to the occurrence of shamelessness in televised self display. The article concludes that because emotions often arise as a result of asymmetrical social relations, research on mediated emotions inevitably constitutes an analysis of symbolic power and the asymmetrical relationships inherent in the process of mediation."
2009-1033,News Coverage of Public Health Risk Issues: The Role of News Sources and the Process of News Construction,Health in the News (High Density),,,,Paper,News Coverage of Public Health Risk Issues: The Role of News Sources and the Process of News Construction,Health in the News (High Density),"This study content analyzes 377 stories in The New York Times about two epidemics, the West Nile virus and the avian flu, to understand the role of news sources in the construction of news stories about public health issues in print media. Our findings indicate significant differences between sources used in the coverage of the two diseases in terms of frequency distribution. However, the sourcing patterns were similar in terms of structural distribution. This is an important finding in light of the differences between West Nile virus, which is seasonal in nature, and avian flu, which is not seasonal. It appears that when covering public health risk issues, journalists might grant more weights to different news sources across the diseases, but they tend to base their narratives on certain bureaucratic and institutional sources regardless of the disease."
2009-1034,News Framing and Public Opinion: A Mediational Analysis,Cognitive Approaches to Framing,,,,Paper,News Framing and Public Opinion: A Mediational Analysis,Cognitive Approaches to Framing,"A growing amount of studies report significant effects of media frames on the formation of public opinion. By intuition, such scholarship must also consider the underlying psychological processes or mediators of such effects. However, the full process of framing effects is complex and the explanatory power of different mediators has not been addressed. Based on an experimental study (N=1,537), this article presents a mediational analysis of a news framing effect on overall opinion, testing for two proposed mediators: belief importance and belief content. Results show that framing is mediated by both belief importance and belief content, with belief content being the more prominent mediator. The extent to which each process takes effect depends on level of political knowledge. Knowledgeable individuals are framed to a greater extent via both belief content and belief importance. The implications for future framing effects research are discussed."

We locate this study in a growing literature at the intersection of new media, democratic theory, and globalization. We then perform a narrative analysis of The French Democracy as a counter-narrative to that which was presented on the most-watched French news channel, TF1. We conclude by arguing that this case of new media cultural production demonstrates the great but limited potential of such new media speech to forge global publics and enter global news agendas, even while its impetus was an exclusion from its local-national news agenda. We propose the term going global to describe this particular mode of global public address."
2009-1036,News on the Move: Exogenous Events and News Coverage of the European Union,Factors Shaping the News,,,,Paper,News on the Move: Exogenous Events and News Coverage of the European Union,Factors Shaping the News,"News coverage about the European Union (EU) is important given its potential to inform citizens about and to involve them in matters of European integration. Whereas prior studies consider whether and how the EU is covered in news media and effects of such coverage on public opinion, investigations of factors that explain variation in EU news coverage are rare. This study sets out to explain the visibility of EU news in national newspapers of seven EU member states for the period 1990 to 2006. It identifies exogenous factors that relate to the EU polity, its policies and to national politics. Weekly variation in EU news visibility is explained drawing on an ordinary least squares regression analysis with panel corrected st andard errors. The descriptive results show that EU news visibility has overall increased and that weekly variation is rather similar in the seven member states. News visibility is substantially influenced by polity-related events such as European Parliamentary (EP) elections or summits and EP sessions. Also policy-related and national events affect visibility. The findings are discussed in light of the news values approach and the consequences of visible EU news coverage."
2009-1037,New Spaces of Immigrant Youth Expression on the Web,Children and Adolescents Online (High Density),,,,Paper,New Spaces of Immigrant Youth Expression on the Web,Children and Adolescents Online (High Density),"This paper examines the expressive practices of immigrant youth in Norway within the spaces of social networking websites . The analysis reveals that these sites provide spaces where these youth make public accounts of their everyday experiences, cultural preferences, and their perspectives on socio-political issues local and global. I will argue in this article that in order define what voice is and what it signifies for individuals in this context it is necessary to prioritize their own perspectives, or in effect listen to their voices, in the literal sense. I show that in this context online expression is a form of cultural production that is particularly meaningful in negotiating the complexities of adolescence and migrant life. Their online spaces have varying significance for these youth. For some their personal sites are semi-private spaces where they engage in personal expression. For others, the desire is to speak out on issues related to their condition."
2009-1038,"Newspapers, Labor, and the Flux of Economic Uncertainty",Working Conditions in Journalism,,,,Paper,"Newspapers, Labor, and the Flux of Economic Uncertainty",Working Conditions in Journalism,"Newsmagazines and journalism trade journals have, in recent years, repeatedly warned readers that the home-delivered local newspaper is dying. The reasons given are well rehearsed: declining circulation, slumping advertising and classified revenue, stalled stock values, and an aging readership. But perhaps the most often cited reason is that the Internet has delivered a death blow to newspapers. It is on the Web, we are told, that most young people search for information, news and entertainment; and without young readers there is no future. This paper argues, contrary to popular discourse, that the Internet and new digital technologies are not killing newspapers; they remain profitable ventures. Instead, new technologies have been used by owners to reconfigure the division of labour within newsrooms. Moreover, this technological convergence of newsrooms must be understood as part of ongoing efforts by owners to extract surplus value from labour within a broader context of neo-liberal political economy."

Through examining the changes, we can see how newsrooms employ the politics of self-censorship to minimize political risks at the same time of maximizing the possibility to realize journalists professional ideals and to pursue public interest. Original reports journalists sent to newsrooms of three cases on social problems and their finally published reports are comparatively studied by using critical discourse analysis to find out what is included and what is excluded in media coverage. Issues raised here are considered with differential concerns between two newsrooms and among news workers at different levels arranging from journalists, to editors, to Editors-in-Chief. Considerations are given to interest conflicts between journalists and newsrooms as a result of the pressures on the press. The conflicts of interest lead to practicing self-censorship within newsrooms as a key way to keep balance among power relations that cast influences over media. The politics of self-censorship in nowadays China has been practiced as a way to counterattack the political censorship from the authority."

It probes slant in the coverage of the Republican plan for fundamental changes in the Social Security. Using the QDA Miner/Wordstat content analysis programs, we were able to perform an unusually fine-grained analysis of the frame contest in the New York Times, USA Today, NBC Nightly and ABC World News, NBCs Meet the Press, and ABCs This Week between July 2004-July. We find favorable slant toward the Bush proposal early on, followed by shift toward negative slant. The software allows us to understand the dynamics of news slant and produced findings that help correct simplistic accusations and understandings of bias and advance theoretical insight into the dynamic relationships among framing, slant, bias and distribution of power."
2009-1041,News We Can Use? Framing Lite-Bite Politics,Framing as a Key Word in the Reporting of Critical Social Issues,,,,Paper,News We Can Use? Framing Lite-Bite Politics,Framing as a Key Word in the Reporting of Critical Social Issues,"The twin professions of journalism and politics share more or less equal billing at the bottom of the league table of public confidence. Journalists exercise their investigative skills hanging around public toilets hoping to scoop a hapless politician. Senators (ab)use their position by doing favours to strategically useful contacts. Whilst not condoning the latter, should we be worried about the former? This paper looks at the ways in which politicians are framed (in all senses of the word) by news media, drawing on semi-structured interviews with 61 Members of the New Zealand Parliament, including the Prime Minister. This evidence suggests that whilst parliamentarians are sanguine about media intrusion at a personal level, they are concerned with the impact of lite-bite or human interest forms of political reporting. The dynamics of framing are perceived to shape the publics view of politics and, by implication, effectively condition what counts as effective democracy."
2009-1042,NGOs and GMOs: A Case Study in Alternative Public Communication of Science and Technology,Philosophy of Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,NGOs and GMOs: A Case Study in Alternative Public Communication of Science and Technology,Philosophy of Communication Poster Session,"An important feature of the social organization of our advanced industrial societies is the demonopolization of scientific knowledge. As science is increasingly confronted with its own products, negative side-effects and risks, these subsequently become the object of scientific analysis. This means that the expansion of science is partly linked to the public critique of science. The apparently counter-modernistic scenario of a broad coalition of NGOs voicing their critique of science and technology then is not a feature of irrational fears of modernization but, on the contrary, an expression of the success of modernization. An emblematic issue in this respect has been the controversy surrounding genetically modified crops and food. Once institutionalized science communication becomes hard to distinguish from corporate communication, NGOs set out to contest and reframe scientific knowledge. Whereas the former increasingly draws from a neo-liberal framing, the latter aim at instigating epistemic shifts and discursive changes. The aim of this paper is to gain a clearer insight into these trends and into how NGOs experience this role as alternative public communicators of science and technology, by focusing on the case study of GMOs. Through several in-depth interviews with spokespersons of the NGOs that have campaigned on this issue in Northern Belgium, the results of this study provide insights into, on the one hand, the self-conceptualization of actors that have achieved a certain amount of cultural legitimation in their role as alternative communicators of science and technology, and on the other, the democratization of science communication."

Thus, this study represents a content analysis of 10 beach volleyball games for the mens and womens Team USA during the 2008 Summer Games. Play-by-play commentary and between-play commentary was analyzed for all 10 games and all court shots and camera angles were coded. Using earlier work examining the existence or presence of gender inequities in mediated coverage of sport in general, the goal was to identify if or how coverage of beach volleyball might still reinforce gender inequities or sexual difference. Findings from an analysis of more than five and one-half hours of playing time suggest that if any sexual difference was evident, it was on the part of the mens team. Bissell and Dukes (2007) analysis of the womens beach volleyball games during the 2004 Olympics suggested that visual coverage of the games tended to emphasize the athletes sexuality via camera shots that focused on specific body parts or via court shots that showed the players from behind. Findings from just under 2,700 court shots coded suggest, again, that sexual difference was not evident in the visual coverage of the 2008 Olympic Games. These and other findings are discussed."

By law they must conduct their business in public. The requirement that a meeting group do its talking in public with either no or a very limited possibility for a closed door session shapes how participants communicate. The paper draws on examples from a 35-month case study (Tracy, 2008) of school board meetings in one Western US district, with data including both meeting excerpts and interviews with two sets of elected officials. In the paper I identify and describe 4-6 discursive practices that people employ when their meetings are open to anyone who wishes to attend or observe."

In each of these cases, the absence of labor unions and the exploitation of screenwriters fueled these locales emergences as critical media centers within the Latin American mediascape. Without unions, media corporations not only reaped larger local profits but were also able to amass wealth and prestige regionally through the sales of scripts. For screenwriters, buyout contracts limited their rights, control, and earnings from their artistic productions.

Whereas much of the scholarship on Latin American telenovelas, in general, have focused on cultural representations and audience consumption, my discussion is more interested in the politics of television, that is, the structures, power relations, and practices that influence how creatives do television. In particular, and echoing Toby Miller et al. (2005) arguments regarding research on Hollywood, I suggest that the analysis of Latin America television should take into account the politics, exploitation and stratification of labor (109)."

The findings indicate that a majority of respondents watch and have a favorable attitude to Nigerian home video films. However, in terms of preference between local and foreign films a small percentage indicated preference for the former. The study concludes that the high quality of production of American films accounts for the favorable views held by respondents, even though it is apparent that these and other foreign productions no longer have a captive market in Nigeria."

Consequently, the broadcasters moral obligation to serve the public interest has been largely neglected in broadcast television. Drawing upon this central issue, the study explored the conceptual issue of media diversity, assessed it in U.S. broadcast television in terms of both supply and demand viewpoints, and reconceptualized it, including both social and economic considerations. This approach combines the holistic approach that essentializes the normative justification of regulatory intervention, with the pragmatic approach that identifies the reality of the media market system which obeys market efficiency as profit entities. Thus, the study attempts to explicate the causal mechanism between the general policy goal and specific indicators, influenced by media industry actions in promoting media diversity."

Though previous scholars have noted Crolys role within the first generation of female journalists, this paper will explore how Crolys conceptualization of gender evolved throughout her career by analyzing a sample of newspaper and magazine articles penned by Croly from 1854 until 1900."
2009-1049,Not an Act of God: Anger in British Disaster Coverage,News and Citizen Participation,,,,Paper,Not an Act of God: Anger in British Disaster Coverage,News and Citizen Participation,"Anger motivates people to engage in political action, fuelling collective struggles for justice and recognition. However, because of its close association with irrationality and aggression, the public expression of anger has been discouraged. This paper focuses on expressions of anger in British disaster coverage between 1952 and 1999. In particular, we look at the relationship between anger, journalistic practices and opportunities for ordinary people to express themselves politically. We examine the following questions: How is anger articulated, mobilized and managed within news media? Who is authorised to express anger, under what circumstances, and what are the subject positions and power relations produced and legitimized by these representations? How are expressions of anger used as the basis of critique of society and politics? To explore these questions, the paper examines the coverage of five national man-made disasters in two national newspapers, The Times and the Daily Mail, and local papers from the area where the disaster occurred.
Our paper concludes that anger opens up a space for ordinary people to critique power holders, allowing victims and those affected by disasters to raise questions of systemic failure and blame. And such questions, it appears, are increasingly part of the emotional management style of disaster journalism."

Within this adoption research, a vast amount of scholars uses Davis (1989) technology acceptance model (TAM) or extended versions thereof. This article suggest a break with this tradition by showing that TAM is limited in its understanding of technology adoption. Instead, two alternative models are proposed that, unlike TAM, acknowledge the role of a technology-specific characteristics and uses (model 1) and temporary dynamical contexts (model 2) in the process of adoption decision-making. Together with TAM, both models were empirically tested by incorporating them in a questionnaire regarding the adoption intention of HDTV in the Netherlands. The results show that both models are indeed viable: they show significant influences on the adoption intentions of HDTV. Together, they also provide for a statistical explained variance that is only slightly lower than TAM-based constructs, while providing a more profound understanding of technology adoption processes."

By way of mediation theory propagated by Silverstone and Couldry, the study justifies practices as crucial to understanding medias intrusive power in the other fields of actions. Political talk shows in the study is analyzed with focus on the salient phenomenon of print journalists turn talk show celebrities. I interpret this unique practice in Taiwans political talk show culture to bring out the following two arguments: (1) Political talk shows represent a field of media practices; (2) An emergent practice of talk-show experts, Ming-zwei, can be observed, which has ordering effects on journalism and politics."
2009-1052,"Notes on the Wire: Music, News, and the Political Economy of Corridos","cial Movements Across Media: Song, News, and New Technologies",,,,Paper,"Notes on the Wire: Music, News, and the Political Economy of Corridos","Social Movements Across Media: Song, News, and New Technologies","The meaning of song has been the subject of much interdisciplinary work in the humanities and human sciences. Scholars have analyzed broadsheets and big bands as messages in and of themselves. Yet these kinds of analyses often overlook a broader ¨social totality, ¨ or political, economic and cultural connections between institutions, commodities, and social control (Meehan, Mosco and Wasko, 1993). Music can express political decisions that affect others, such as debt relief and human rights (Brancaccio, 2006). It also carries exchange value for purposes of import and export (Marx, 1906). Music is at once political and economic.

Corridos, or Mexican folk ballads, merit a political economic analysis because of their reflection on news events first narrated by ideological institutions (Mendoza, 1939). Their artists, or corridistas, gather material only after corporate journalists break ¨official¨ stories (Levin, 2007). This reflective period poses interesting questions for value-conscious scholars. Can corridistas maintain the relevance of old news? How do values influence their public role as ¨men in the street¨? This article argues corridos uniquely offer journalistic commentary on the political economic relationship between history, society, morality and praxis in ways that other musical genres do not. Three distinct texts from months of archival research in México will demonstrate how these characteristics afford corridistas a means of ¨talking back¨ to institutions and opinion leaders. The article begins by broadly situating music within political economy."
2009-1053,Not Trusting Trust and Doubting Doubt: Practices of Emotion Management in the Financial Industry,Organizational Discourse: Theory and Research,,,,Paper,Not Trusting Trust and Doubting Doubt: Practices of Emotion Management in the Financial Industry,Organizational Discourse: Theory and Research,"Using interview data gathered among people employed in financial organizations, the study examines practices of emotion management in the financial industry. The study advocates a communication centered approach to the analysis of emotion and examines how the meanings attributed to emotions enable financial researchers to make sense of their work through strategies of emotion management. The results suggest that emotions are generally viewed as a threat, liability and weakness and, therefore, need to be constantly monitored and controlled. Emotion management strategies include elimination of feelings from the research process by means of blocking them and substituting with rational reasoning. Also, the study discusses skepticism as an emotion management strategy that helps financial analysts control their spontaneous feelings of trust, excitement, confidence, fear, or pessimism."
2009-1054,Obama Fans Worldwide: The Politics of Affect and Proximity,Barack Obama and Popular Communication: The Rise of Politics of the Popular,,,,Paper,Obama Fans Worldwide: The Politics of Affect and Proximity,Barack Obama and Popular Communication: The Rise of Politics of the Popular,"Throughout the coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign common terms in the context of elections in indirect parliamentary democracies such as voters and parties were increasingly replaced by fans or movements. During the primary season, Clinton and Obama supporters in particular were commonly portrayed as fans, as much as Sarah Palin supporters later attracted the same attribute. Indeed the forms of engagement by these audience members with individual politicians  from attending rallies, wearing or creating campaign merchandise, attending live events and following the candidate of their choice across a range of media platforms and the intertxual field of the campaigns  mirrors the patterns of affective engagement at a mediated distance that have been documented in the study of audiences and fans of popular culture.

Based on interviews with fans and supporters of Barack Obama in the United States and beyond as well as an analysis of online fora frequented by Obama enthusiasts, this paper assesses the consequences of the rise of political fandom in the case of Barack Obama on political activism, culture, its mediation.

The one exception concerned a six-episode webcast of a Dutch comedian who revived one of his old characters, 'white negro' Oboema, as the brother of Obama. Yet, in the mix of information and entertainment that public broadcasting organisations produced to cover Obama, humorous streaks were core ingredients, and some right-wing website coverage could be considered as satirical. In this paper, I will discuss these instances of humor and satire with three aims: to show empirically how outside of the US, in this case in the Netherlands, the elections were popularized; to discuss more fundamentally how Dutch likes and dislikes of Obama are articulated with particular humorous styles, and became the subject of political debate and questions in parliament; to theorize how global flows of satire affects local political cultures.

This paper uses a historically situated critical cultural analysis inspired by the work of Michel Foucault to argue that federal judicial opinions in cases of obscenity between 1873 and 1945 evince a project of moral governance of risky content premised on the disciplinarian regulation of a media consumers inner life though the regulation of his or her emotions. Specifically, the analysis illustrates the emergence and crystallization in judicial opinions of two sets of systematic and complex instructions for situating and penalizing lust as an effect from exposure to obscene media, and managing social shame across gender lines."
2009-1057,"Occasioning the Real: Lacan, Deleuze, and Cinematic Structuring of Sense",pectacle/ Narrative/ Truth,,,,Paper,"Occasioning the Real: Lacan, Deleuze, and Cinematic Structuring of Sense",Spectacle/ Narrative/ Truth,"This essay explores the extent to which revisions of Lacanian film theory, which posit that the gaze belongs to the order of the Real as opposed to the imaginary, can, when read through Gilles Deleuzes notion of sense, open the possibility that the cinematic apparatus, as a language, can structure the Real gaze as a Deleuzian form of sense. Although Deleuze begins to investigate some of the ways in which cinema can act as a sense-structuring system in The Time Image, I believe that this aspect of his theory of sense, as articulated to film, needs further development. Thus, using Lars von Triers film Dogville as an illustration, I explore the potential of a revised return to apparatus theory and the framework of film as language, in order to ascertain whether these models, when theorized in the context of Lacans notion of the Real gaze and Deleuzes concept of sense, can supply a useful paradigm for conceptualizing film as a signifying system which acts as a vehicle transmitting sense in the form of the Real gaze, a process which carries possibilities for theorizing more radical modes of spectatorship than allowed by prior approaches to Lacanian film theory."
2009-1058,"Of Ghosts, Future, and Memories",On Community,,,,Paper,"Of Ghosts, Future, and Memories",On Community,"In this paper, I wish to speak about future, not a future as an image, not an image of what is to come, but future as the very coming of that which makes the imagination of a futureperhaps its failure as wellpossible. But how can one speak of that which is yet to come? How can one approach what one has to wait for? To speak of future, one therefore must do so obliquely. So, instead of speaking about future directly, which is impossible, I shall speak of memory. However, for the same reason that one cannot speak about future directly, I will speak of memory by way of what it both is and is not; I thus speak of ghosts, apparitions, or specters, indeed, whatever haunts us. This requires, as Derrida suggests, a hauntology, and, following Derrida, I argue that this hauntology is irreducible when we speak of future.

Memory haunts us, since it comes back. If memory comes back, if it is something that returns, then it has more than one location. If memory has more than one location, if it exists both here and elsewhere, then its identity and its nature can be defined only by its very mobility from one place to another: From one place to another in the form of return. It is this return, a structure of preordained turning, that enables memory to escape the opposition between being and nonbeing, between presence and absence. It is through memory, through its return, that a future is opened as a possibility. At the same time, however, since memory is never where it appears, the future it brings to pass is never the future in which it is embodied. It is in this spectrealityreal and unreal, spectrealthat future can be found. But it is found as nothing but the haunting loss to the future."

By examining the latest developments concerning legal regulations and policy implementation of the digital switchover in Bulgaria, this study tries to illuminate the myriad of challenges new EU members might face. The study concludes that while some of the technical aspects of the digital switchover seem to be largely synchronized with EU regulations, the legal process is largely defined by a lack of transparency and deliberate politicization of capital and corporate interests."

Communication with peer group members was the most important motivation for SNS use. Participants high in positive collective self-esteem were strongly motivated to communicate with peer group via SNS. Females were more likely to report high positive collective self-esteem, greater overall use, and SNS use to communicate with peers. Females also posted higher means for group-in-self, passing time, and entertainment. Negative collective self-esteem correlated with social compensation suggesting that those who felt negatively about their social group used SNS as an alternative to communicating with other group members. Males were more likely to report negative collective self-esteem and SNS use for social compensation and social identity gratifications."

This paper advances two research questions that examine whether sharing a salient, and potentially discriminated against, characteristic with a political candidate leads to higher or lower favorability ratings towards that candidate. Results suggest that older voters are more critical of age than younger voters, which opposes hypotheses derived from social categorization theory and the similarity hypothesis. This research also advances boundary conditions that should be considered in the above-mentioned theories and provides implications for how these findings contribute to our understanding of cognitions underlying candidate preferences."
2009-1063,Olfactory Attractiveness: The Role of Scent Cues in Attraction and Mate Choice,Attractiveness as Multimodal Interpersonal Communication,,,,Paper,Olfactory Attractiveness: The Role of Scent Cues in Attraction and Mate Choice,Attractiveness as Multimodal Interpersonal Communication,"Two lines of new evidence indicate that scent plays a role in human attraction through its links with reproduction. First, body odors can be used to assess genetic compatibility. The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a set of genes controlling immunity that produces downstream products detectable on the skin through scent. Offspring have broader immunity if they inherit different MHC alleles from each of their parents. Humans prefer the body odors of MHC-dissimilar others, and the relationships of couples who differ in their MHC are characterized by greater sexual attraction than those who share MHC genes. Second, womens body odors covary with fertility across the cycle, and men prefer the body odors of women sampled at high fertility points of the cycle. We will discuss evidence from our lab pertaining to these relationships, and we will discuss the previously underappreciated role of scent in attraction and mate choice."

Specifically, using flattery effects (Fogg & Nass, 1997) as an example of social responses, two experiments examined how human-likeness of the interface, individuals rationality, and cognitive busyness moderate the extent to which people make social attributions to computers. To do so, participants were asked to play a trivia game with a computer, which they knew generated random answers accompanied by either strictly factual or flattering feedback on their performance. In Experiment 1, anthropomorphic cartoon characters improved participants overall evaluations of the computer, but they significantly reduced low rationals self-confidence, suggesting social facilitation effects. Moreover, low rationals were more likely to dismiss the computers suggestions when they received flattering than factual feedback from the computer, whereas high rationals showed no corresponding tendency. In Experiment 2, participants attributed greater social attractiveness to the flattering (vs. generic-comment) computer, but they became more suspicious about the validity of its claims and were less likely to accept its suggestions. Such effects, however, dissipated when they were simultaneously engaged in a secondary task. Theoretical implications for CASA are discussed."
2009-1065,One Country Two Expectations: The Comparison of Public Agendas in Shanghai and Guangzhou during Beijing Olympic Games,"New Media, National Image, and Social Transition in the Chinese Context",,,,Paper,One Country Two Expectations: The Comparison of Public Agendas in Shanghai and Guangzhou during Beijing Olympic Games,"New Media, National Image, and Social Transition in the Chinese Context","For people who live in China, the year 2008 is a year full of big events. This is a panel study based on a recent two-wave audience surveys in Shanghai and Guangzhou with a probability sample of more than 1,000 subjects.
The subjects in two cities were asked to pick and rank 10 issues according to their importance from a list of 20 agendas that include national events (Beijing Olympic Games, Sichuan Earthquake, Return of Taiwan, Cleaning Corruption and Political Reform, etc.) and individual-life-related events (Inflations, Crash of Stock Market, High Property Price, Unemployment, Health Insurance, Food Safety, etc.). Other variables under investigation are media use patterns, level of nationalism, and likeness and evaluations of 18 representative foreign countries.
The result of survey data analysis demonstrates an interesting picture of One Country, Two Expectations. Guangzhou residents, with their access to alternative information through exposure to Hong King TV and cross-border visiting, emphasized more issues directly relevant to individual life such as Inflations, Property Price, Health Insurance, and Education. However, those live in Shanghai, where domestic media dominant the information environment, gave higher priorities to events with national significance such as Beijing Olympic Games, Taiwan Reunion with China, Cleaning Corruption, and Political System Reform.
Besides, people in Shanghai showed relatively higher level of nationalism than those in Guangzhou. Compared with Cantonese, Shanghainese gave lower evaluations to developing countries on their levels of General Force and Sports Development."

How Miners Interact About Their Dirty Work,"Sense-Making and Work Identities: Examining Dirty Work, Stigma, Class, and Media Use","Mining is an example of dirty work, a physically tainted occupation. People working in mines face the challenge to construct a positive self-image while society views their occupation as dangerous and dirty. Previous research in dirty work contexts unveiled several coping strategies for enhancing self-esteem and a positive work meaning. Using the data from 32 semi-structured interviews with employees of South African gold mines, we studied how individuals within a group deal with taint. The stories confirmed the expectation that miners are aware of a stigma towards their work. Apart from the familiar normalizing strategies, miners also tried to soften the taint of their work through caricaturizing occupations and risks above the ground. In contrast to previous dirty work-studies, that consider a group of dirty workers as a whole, we found several types of downward comparison within the group. The expected strong group culture was challenged by supervisors distancing themselves from subordinates and men disparaging female miners."

Such communities are emergent, developed by the interactions of those who seek other fans and, implicitly, dialogically define the boundaries of membership for their communities. This conceptualization understands communities to be fundamentally communicative. To understand the emergence, maintenance, and perhaps demise of any fan community, the communicating practices of that community should be examined. Focusing on the communicative processes allows comparison of fan communities from different fandoms."

Although online forums, blogging and publications have become increasingly popular, their real impact on public opinion and existing political and press systems is yet to be fully supported by empirical evidence. Through a case study of an incident of media censorship in Singapore, this study examines the role played by online blogging and publications in bringing the censored story back to public attention and the mainstream media. The study shows online activities can no longer be simply regarded as virtual and isolated from the general public. They have become an important part of the public sphere of a society and began to exert their impact on a country's political and press systems."

As online news has developed, the idea of a single news item has been replaced by fast-changing content and new repertoires of constructing Breaking News. Whereas most research of online news has used synchronic rather than diachronic methods, this article introduces a new approach, which we choose to call Regular Interval Content Capture (RICC). The data produced by RICC enables dynamic online media texts to be studied as they are produced, edited, and changed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. In our study, the US. Crucial Tuesday primary elections serve as the empirical example. From a discourse analytical perspective, we analyze a total of 64 hours of online news flows collected from the US and International editions of CNN.com. The RICC approach allows us to find major representational differences between the two editions. Three different modes of writing, characterizing different stages of CNNs reporting, were identified."

A repeated-measures ANCOVA with media, perceived distance of others, and desirability of ads as the predictors and the TPE as the criterion variable revealed an interaction effect between the media and the desirability of ads. The participants demonstrated a greater TPE for the ad on the Internet than that on television only when the ad is a negative ad. While the main effects of media and desirability of ads were not found statistically significant, the main effect of the perceived distance of others was statistically significant."

It also addressed differences in relational maintenance behaviors as a function of percentage of communication that occurs online and whether the behavior was enacted face-to-face or via CMC. Mens relational satisfaction was positively related to their engagement in relational maintenance behaviors but negatively related to their partners behaviors. Womens relational satisfaction was positively related to their behaviors but not related to their partners behaviors. Percentage of communication was related to engagement in some, but not all, online relational maintenance behaviors. Participants also exhibited some differences in relational maintenance behavior frequency face-to-face and via CMC. Implications for the role of CMC in relational maintenance and satisfaction are discussed."
2009-1075,Online Social Networks as a Constraint to Deception in Online Resumes,Online Disclosure and Nondisclosure,,,,Paper,Online Social Networks as a Constraint to Deception in Online Resumes,Online Disclosure and Nondisclosure,"This study explores constraints to deception in social networking websites (SNS). We argue that because specific features of SNS, such as the ability for individuals in the social network to view profile information, connect the real-world and online self (Walther & Parks, 2002) the costliness of deception is increased (Donath, 1999). We tested this prediction in the context of online resumes constructed on Linkedin.com®. Participants (N = 123) in a between-subjects experiment created profiles in three self-presentational settings: a traditional (offline) resume, a private SNS profile and a public SNS profile. Findings suggest that deception did not differ in frequency between SNS profile conditions, although self-presentational conditions affected job-related types of deception that people use in resumes. Individuals tended to lie more about interests in public SNS than in private SNS and traditional resumes, in contrast people tend to lie less about responsibilities in public SNS than in private SNS and traditional resumes. The results are discussed in terms of warranting and the costliness of deception (Donath, 1999)."

To better understand the challenges facing parents who would seek to adhere to the guidelines, we conducted qualitative small group interviews with 60 parent/child dyads from each of the following 3 age groups: 6-7, 9-10, and 12-13 (n=180 children and 180 parents). Parents and children were interviewed separately and transcripts were thematically analyzed. Results indicate four salient challenges to limiting TV time: 1) conflict in the home due to childrens anger at parents rules and increased bickering between siblings; 2) replacing TV requires more time and effort from parents and requires monetary/ community resources that are not available; 3) televisions beneficial role as an entertainer, babysitter and educator; 4) a lack of conviction that TV time needs to be limited."

We argue that a complex design surfaces human intersubjective experiences in our encounter with Eros and that our strict modern separation of reason and love forecloses an overarching unity, put forth by Lacan trough the concept Y a l'Un (there is One)."

we know about their culture, the more we turn to, and are influenced by,
media images and stories and further that the media presents a distorted
view of Arabs and Arab culture, often negative in nature, and thus, the
media is likely to have a deleterious impact on attitudes towards Arabs.
This study investigates the differential impact that positive and negative
news presentations, comedy news, and entertainment portrayals of Arabs and
Muslims (both positive and negative) on attitudes towards Arabs and Muslims
and their implications for policy questions on civil liberties protection.
An experimental design with five independent variables (negative hard news,
positive hard news, negative entertainment, negative comedy-news, and the
control) and two dependent variables (support for identity-based policy
issues and approval of civil liberty restrictions). We find that both
positive and negative presentations have greater impact than the pure
entertainment and control group conditions and that subjects viewing
negative news presentations are much more likely to approve restriction on
civil liberties than in the other conditions. Future studies should
further explore the interactions of fear and priming on the relationship
and its impact on a population with greater variance of pre - existing
identity based prejudices."

Much research attention has been given in the interpersonal and family communication literature exploring self-disclosure and topic avoidance. That literature, overwhelmingly composed of self-report studies, suggests that Voicing concerns are based upon fears of intimacy in that self-disclosing or raising a troublesome topic may make one vulnerable in various ways to ones partner and it may threaten the continuation of the relationship. Findings of this conversation analytic study of naturally-occurring interactions between close family members suggests that the interactional, rather than psychological, hazards of intimate ties may well provide a better account of Voicing concerns and Voicelessness.

Family conflict is embedded in both family members Shared Interactional History and expectations of a shared interactional future and in the multi-party nature of family relationships. Consequently, Voicing and Not Voicing in a current conversation can become accountable actions affecting future interactions with the same or different conversational partners. For example, Mothers report to her adult daughter (Dad says you ↑hate him.) about daughters earlier conflict with her father makes her Voicings to him accountable in the current conversation and future ones with both Mother and Father. And Daughters response (.h (0.4) I didnt say that.) orients to her accountability and contributes to the interactional re-construction of the argument for all three family members. It is, therefore, not surprising that Voicing and Not Voicing are conversational actions to which family members often attend. Findings of the study demonstrate that family members employ 1)Reports of Voicing Concerns, 2)Overt Silencing Actions, 3)Overt Dismissals, and 4)Claims to Voicing Rights in their negotiation of Voicing and Voicelessness during family conflict."

Existing theoretical and practical perspectives have serious shortcomings in efforts to understand the role of campaigns in changing SHBDs. This paper proposes two conceptual models, building on Viswanaths (2006) concept of communication inequality, that explicate the role of campaigns in reducing, maintaining, or widening SHBDs. The first model proposes that campaigns can produce SHBDs through differences in meaningful exposure, differences in persuasion or motivational response, and/or differences in skills or opportunity to act or maintain action. The second model proposes that public and policymaker attributions of responsibility are a primary influence on support for policies to create healthier environments for behavior change among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. I use smoking and behaviors related to obesity (healthy eating and active living) as case studies to illustrate propositions of the models and discuss their broader analytic and practical implications."

Based on factor analysis on a sample of 1410 European communicators, five major working functions are identified: lobbying with external constituencies, advising and reviewing policies, positioning the firm in the marketplace as well as external and internal facilitation. Conducting ANOVA we hold that some of the more technician-related working activities are predominantly exercised by female communication professionals whereas managerial activities are prevalently performed by their male counterparts. As will be shown, while the educational background does not diverge between genders, salaries as well as job satisfaction does, likewise, there are differences regarding educational background, salaries as well as job satisfaction on a European level."
2009-1082,Ontological Dualism: An Information Processing-Based Differentiation Between Objective and Subjective Reality,Keywords in Information Systems: Cognitive Resources (High Density),,,,Paper,Ontological Dualism: An Information Processing-Based Differentiation Between Objective and Subjective Reality,Keywords in Information Systems: Cognitive Resources (High Density),"Study of the field of communication is split between largely incommensurate objectivist and subjectivist approaches. This paper describes a theory for the reconciliation of objective and subjective reality called Ontological Dualism. A reality is defined as a system that imposes effects on the entities within it. For humans, there are two realities: alpha (objective reality) and beta (the world of beliefs). Beta reality is shaped by the nature of human information processing, particularly by its capacity limitations and biases. Human cognition evolved to an adaptive optimum that allows us to construct mental representations of the world that are accurate enough for our survival, but which are incomplete and often contain errors. False beliefs are vulnerable to being adjusted toward their objectively true values through an event called a correction, which is compared to Kuhns paradigm shift. Five factors are described that influence a false beliefs susceptibility or robustness to correction: veridicality, falsifiability, accretion, congruence, and utility. The correction factors define the boundaries of beta reality and place limits on its malleability. There is a general tendency for false beliefs to gravitate nonmonotonically toward their objectively true values over time within an information community. Obtaining knowledge about alpha reality and manipulating beta reality involve two different skill sets, which accounts for peoples differing competency at them."

Findings From a Multinational Study on Leading Online Newspapers UGC Practices,,,,Paper,"Open Spaces, Closed Structures: The Integration of UGC Management in the Routines of the Online Newsroom",The Decline of the Gatekeeper? Findings From a Multinational Study on Leading Online Newspapers UGC Practices,"Mainstream news organizations are increasingly appealing for contributions from the public and incorporating this content into professionally defined online news structures. But research shows that unfiltered content from amateurs can sit awkwardly alongside material that has been subject to the system of checks and balances of professional journalism. The platforms provided for users to contribute to a news outlet are designed and structured by journalistic norms and practices, largely segregated into defined spaces on news websites. The interviews with online journalists suggest that different user inputs (comments, photos, texts) are dealt with differently in the newsrooms, depending on the production stage where the input enters and therefore resulting in different workflows. However, we have detected a lack of systematic planning in UGC management. Participatory journalism can be seen as a way of creating a more diverse and pluralistic media. Achieving this goal, and integrating UGC within newsroom routines, requires better management planning; this presentation will highlight what online journalists regard as best practices in this regard. Most of the time, journalists retain a gate-keeping mindset in their conceptualization of the spaces for inclusion of non-professional voices in the news process."
2009-1084,Operational Models and Bureaucratic Imperatives in the Global Promotion of Media Diversity,Contemporary Perspectives on the Performance of the Press,,,,Paper,Operational Models and Bureaucratic Imperatives in the Global Promotion of Media Diversity,Contemporary Perspectives on the Performance of the Press,"In this paper, I discuss the effectiveness of international aid in support of freedom of expression glboally. I argue that initiatives are typically beset by analytical and bureaucratic problems. The first problem is the absence of solid, sophisticated models to inform media assistance programs. It is hard to envision the implementation of effective plans in the promotion of press and democracy as long as the premises remain ill-developed. Just making press freedom the overriding goal of media assistance doesnt help to clarify the rationale behind programmatic interventions. Press freedom is a contested concept; it is too ambiguous to provide a clear roadmap. It is equally used by free-market libertarians promoting media business, radical activists lambasting corporate media, journalists defending the virtues of professional reporting, public service media advocates, and media moguls objecting taxes on press economies. Its conceptual elasticity favors its canonical status as the dominant ideal of media democracy, but it does not offer concrete policies and programmatic guidelines. Nor is press freedom sufficient to assess current dangers to media democracy. It is based on an obsolete and unrealistic notion of press performance. Instead, I propose to integrate ideas about press freedom and independence within the notion of media diversity to determine goals and indicators."

Here, we offer an explanation for this lag effect, based in diffusion of innovation theory, and suggest strategies for accelerating the adoption of individual, organizational, and public policy changes. We focus on harnessing an abundant and renewable resource that is common across countries known as social influence. The ability to use existing patterns of social influence to affect the adoption of desirable individual, organizational, and governmental innovations depends on conceptual and methodological skills for accurately identifying and activating informal opinion leaders whose actions and attitudes in turn affect what countless others of us do. Fortunately, these conceptual and methodological skills are codified, with tools available for climate change advocates and researchers."
2009-1086,Ordinary Production: Reality TV and Emotional Labor,The Management of Mediated Performance,,,,Paper,Ordinary Production: Reality TV and Emotional Labor,The Management of Mediated Performance,"Much has been written about the rise of reality programming and the performances of ordinary people in this context. But the vast majority of academic scholarship examines the political-economic forces behind the genre, the politics of representation as they play out on individual shows, or select fan activity as accessed online. Few scholars attend to the specific activities and practices that structure the performative space that ordinary people must occupy, particularly as understood by the architects of this space: production personnel. By contrast, this paper takes an ethnographic approach to the issue to the production of media performances in the age of new media. More specifically, I draw on two genres of reality television  daytime talk shows and docudramas  to examine the behind-the-scenes production practices employed to ensure that ordinary people deliver successful on-camera performances. I argue that these production practices are themselves ordinary performances insofar as they rely on the everyday life-skills of emotion work. As sociologists have noted, the concept of emotion work  along with its marketplace corollary, emotional labor -- is highly feminized, since it is both a marker of conventional femininity and a requirement of many traditionally female occupations. Consequently, this paper explores the extent to which producers rely on emotional labor, the specific forms of emotional labor they employ, and the implications of these feminine production practices for reality programming more generally."

The data were collected from 621 employees of 20 companies in the US and 27 companies in Korea. The findings showed that as employees perceived their organizations to provide a greater amount of support for smokers quitting efforts, employees increased attraction toward their organizations. The extent to which employees considered a smoke-free policy at their workplace to be severely enforced was negatively related to organizational attraction. The negative relationship between perceived severity and organizational attraction, however, became weaker for organizations that had employees with higher perception of organizational support. As ex-smokers, in contrast to smokers, considered smoke-free policies at their workplaces to be more severely enforced, their attraction toward their organizations increased. There was no national difference in any of the findings."

In this paper, I use a narrative approach to examine the media discourse surrounding the launch of the worlds cheapest car in India, and reveal the construction of national pride through globalization, the new national citizen, and the silencing of the alternative subject by reframing him/her as anti national. A dialectic is seen not only between traditionally perceived Indian-ness and global business culture, but also within the idea of national culture, further problematizing the resolution of being Indian in the age of globalization. Not only is the corporate depicted as hero and the alternative subject as villain, but the larger citizenry is painted as victim to be saved by the organization."

We frame this study within both accounts of journalism studies literature and organizational culture change literature, using both to create a larger argument about how we may begin to approach to the problem of traditional media organizations negotiating the challenges of new media. Our findings suggest that journalists are apprehensive about change and that it is difficult for clear visions about new media change to be communicated throughout each organization. Our findings also reveal that public service news journalists are particularly committed to the unique values of their organization- credibility, trust, balance, integrity, good storytelling and quality journalism, among others  and worry that these news values could be lost in a multiplatform, Web-focused world."

A survey investigated the autonomy level of public relations practitioners and organizational ethical culture as the antecedents. The results suggest that autonomy is indispensable for enacting ethics counselor role. Organizational ethical culture has a two-step structure, and top managements support for ethics affects other organizational factors: participatory culture through open communication, presence of codes of ethics, and ethics training programs. Participatory culture is significantly related to the autonomy level. The autonomy of public relations practitioners has a mediating effect between participation in strategic decision-making and the ethics counselor role. This study also finds that those linkages vary according to organizational type, e.g., corporations, communication/public relations agencies, and non-profit organizations."

I used thematic analysis to identify the strategies that the organization used to seek the identification of its members. Results of the study showed that by emphasizing membership as an exclusive privilege, recognizing the individual as a symbol of excellence, celebrating member achievements, inviting member contributions, emphasizing commitment to diversity, emphasizing organizational symbolism and highlighting testimonials of appreciation, the organization tried to seek the identification of its members. In many of the above-mentioned strategies, the overarching theme of elitism was evident. This raises certain pertinent questions pertaining to organizational identification."

The findings have suggested that student editors were more likely to self-censor content when primary control was perceived to belong to individuals acting at the organizational level, such as faculty advisers and academic affairs administrators. Significant differences were found to exist between the perceptions of student editors, faculty advisers, and academic affairs administrators in relation to influences on content and their relationship to censorship issues. Student editors were the only group who reported perceiving censorship as a problem for their student newspaper. The survey results demonstrated that most public institutions had official governing rules and were not experiencing censorship issues."
2009-1094,Organizational Metaconversations and Authenticity,Communication and Authenticity (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Organizational Metaconversations and Authenticity,Communication and Authenticity (Cross Unit),"Organization occurs in metaconversation. Metaconversations can be exclusive in that some of the voices the metaconversations are supposed to represent or translate are being misrepresented or silenced. Metaconversations can also be inclusive and representative in the sense that the absent conversations of the communities of practice that make up the organization are being given voice. One of the important skills of a manager is the ability to translate all the voices of an organization to create a metaconversation. These metaconversational translations can be more or less authentic. Managers sometimes fail to engage in an authentic and inclusive meta¬conversation. They might be either unable or unwilling to engage in the constitution of a conversational and cognitive domain that has as its object the distinctions of the conversational domains of their subordinates, and therefore fail to represent or translate the conversations of which the organization is composed in an authentic manner."

Many organizations struggle with the question how to deal with online forums that discuss their products and services. In this paper, we report about a study in which different organizational responses (apologies, refutation, no response) to a negative online consumer review were tested in an experiment. No effects were found on product evaluation, but the results show that refutation of the claims in a negative consumer review leads to lower corporate credibility and to higher reviewer credibility, whereas apologizing had no effect on these variables. Both apologizing and refutation (as opposed to not responding) made participants rate the complaint in the review as more severe. The effects on the evaluation of the review(er) were moderated by prior brand involvement: those high in involvement with the brand that was discussed were more affected by the organizational response. The results are discussed in terms of possible underlying processes and practical implications."

Using Monges (1990) work on organizational change, within and between variable measurement research designs are proposed as a means to move beyond static or snapshot studies, investigate the importance of messages sent to newcomers, and better capture the dynamic and evolving nature in socialization. A framework for exploring processes in socialization and guidelines for conducting process research are offered."

The present study explores the effect of Organization-Based Self-Esteem (OBSE) on employees use of informal networks, especially their media preference for informal communication. Analysis of data from 342 employees reveals a significantly negative relationship between OBSE and employees frequency of informal communication. Additional analyses indicate that high OBSE employees prefer traditional media for informal communication while low OBSE employees prefer electronic media. Moreover, low OBSE employees showed a more positive attitude toward rich electronic media for informal communication than did high OBSE employees. High OBSE employees preferred rich traditional media. Implications of these findings for organizations are discussed."
2009-1099,Organizing Change in Participatory Development,Theory and Policy in Communication for Social Change,,,,Paper,Organizing Change in Participatory Development,Theory and Policy in Communication for Social Change,"Increasingly, communication scholars have called for the examination of the role of participatory processes in the realm of development (Storey & Jacobson, 2004). Challenging the top-down conceptualizations of traditional development communication projects (Escobar, 1995; Singhal & Rogers, 1999, 2002), these scholars have noted the importance of engaging with local communities in projects of development. The basic argument underlying the work on participatory communication is drawn on the belief that engaging local communities in participatory spaces creates more effective avenues for the diffusion of the innovation in the targeted communities. This manuscript further builds on the literature on participatory communication to examine the tenets of participation as articulated in the realm of the culture-centered approach. This paper draws upon a case study of the child reporters of Koraput to interrogate the intersections of culture, structure, and agency within which participation is constituted."

In this report we examine the use of a lexical form (or) that does not ordinarily on its occurrence project possible repair ahead by either altering the progressive realization of a turns talk (e.g. with a non-lexical speech perturbation such as a cut-off sound, sound stretch, or uh) or by showing lexically that repair may be underway (e.g. well, I mean) (Schegloff, Jefferson & Sacks 1977). Uses of or to initiate repair can be seen in the following extracts:

[PP:Karen]
01 Clt: =if youve had a good nights slee:p for exa:mple.
02 Kar: Thats thats correct yeah. Because [I do:] actually=
03 Clt: [Uh:m:]
04 Kar: =find or I did fi:nd that when I wake up in a

((Talking about Bevs midwife who recently had a baby at home - which Bev also plans to do))
01 Clt: And it shows that shes rea:lly committed .hh
02 and she knows what its li:ke.=You know from
03 the receiving end.=O[:r the: ] (.) m-=
04 Bev: [Thats right.]
05 Clt: active end as it we(h)re.

In the first case, the same-TCU repair replaces a present-tense with a past-tense action formulation (with actually treated as dispensable). In the second case, the transition-space repair replaces a first formulation of the role of the midwife as a labouring woman (rather than as health care worker) with another - more agentic - formulation for the same role. In both cases the or initiates the repair, but is not itself part of, the repair solution. (This contrasts with or-initial repairs of which we will also show some cases.) Based on our analysis of more than 100 instances, we show that 'or'-initiation is a recurrent method for launching repair that can be seen to shift (through what is said subsequently) the first order understanding of 'or' as projecting an alternative to what was said beforehand, to a second order understanding of it as having projected an alternative saying to what was said - thereby revealing it to be a self-repair. Or-initiated repairs can occur at any position in the repair-initiation-opportunity space (same-TCU, transition-space, third turn, and third position), and are associated with the action of reformulating actions, persons, places, things, times, etc., in order to do precision of reference. Finally, we will discuss the use of or as a repair initiation in relation to other lexical initiations and extend our discussion of tacit repair initiation beyond the case of or."

The findings confirm that ownership does matter in the production of news on local broadcasts. In general, independent stations broadcast more local content on their newscasts than those stations that were either (1) owned-and-operated and part of a duopoly; (2) owned-and-operated-only; or (3) part of a duopoly-only. In summary, consolidated media ownership negatively affects the production of local content on local newscasts"

One hundred eighteen parents and adolescents from divorced and non-divorced families were asked to talk about something stressful related to the parents relationship. Their cortisol and α-amylase were measured at four time points. The current study is significant because it is the first to show that parents inappropriate disclosures can impact childrens bodies in the form of cortisol and A-A reactance. The findings also illustrate the importance of the age of the child in determining childrens stress responses. Young adults from divorced families appeared to be the most bothered by their parents inappropriate disclosures. This study also examined parents stress reactions to their own inappropriate disclosures. The extent to which parents disclosures increased or decreased their stress depended upon the strain in the parental relationship, if the parent was divorced or still married, and the appropriateness of the disclosures."

However little is known about how this process is accomplished by doctors and patients in their communication. Female patients being treated for a cancer recurrence at a comprehensive cancer center (n = 26) were asked to tell the story of both their initial and recurrent cancer discovery and asked several semi-structured questions, some of which were directed towards communication at prognosis. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and prognosis themes drawn from the data. Patient participants described themes of communication as optimistic at diagnosis, shifting to treatment manageability when the disease recurred. This chronic disease perspective presented several communicative challenges to doctors and patients including increased ambiguity for discussing survival, resulting in a dance around prognosis that neither doctors or patients are well equipped to manage. Theoretic and pragmatic implications are discussed."

In most topical domains, patients respond to physicians' queries by providing only the requested information. However, when patients respond to physicians' substance use queries, they often do more than providing information; they enact normative stances toward their reported substance use conduct so as to provide for an understanding of their conduct as normatively appropriate. In doing so, patients display an orientation toward substance use as a potentially sensitive domain, one in which identity concerns may be especially salient. This analysis describes a variety of interactional practices that patients employ in enacting normative stances. Implications for medical practice are also addressed."

Contrary to previous research on the relationship between media expenditures on media and economy under the Principle of Relative Constancy (PRC), this study found industrialization, urbanization, and per capita income combined influenced advertising density and percentage of expenditures on cultures and recreations. It also showed that there was no inter-media competition for advertising among different provinces in China. Both conclusions were against the Constancy and Functional Equivalence assumptions held in PRC. In addition, the study found differences in the relationship between media expenditures and economy, and advertising on broadcasting media tended to follow economic development more closely than on print media."
2009-1107,Peace Communication: A Call for a New Approach in Peacebuilding,"Protest, Conflict and Social Action",,,,Paper,Peace Communication: A Call for a New Approach in Peacebuilding,"Protest, Conflict and Social Action","The following article suggests a new approach of Peacebuilding on community level, arguing that communication in the sense of Communicative Action as described by Habermas is the key to conflict transformation on interpersonal level. The local level is usually neglected by classical approaches of intervention, which are predominantly specified for activities on the international level. Our model is built on a set of criteria from Habermas work such as the need for an integrative vision of peace, the creation of a shared lifeworld, the provision of ideal speech situations and the development of institutional structures rooted in the community and its traditions (and not on the national level and western traditions of representative democracy). The Peacebuilding potential of these criteria is exemplified along a case study of a Peace Zone in Mindanao (Philippines), where peace was reached by means of communication in a community surrounded by ongoing conflict. We show that this Peace Zone gives a concrete example of how activities, developed by a multi-ethnic and divided community itself, based on principles of Communicative Action, can not only mitigate conflict on the base of institutionalization, but even reach a certain stage of conflict transformation by creating a shared lifeworld and common identity among its inhabitants."

Guided by the theory of motivated information management (TMIM), this study proposes that young adults information-seeking decisions can be accounted for by: 1) their anxiety of uncertainty discrepancy; 2) their perceived capacity to raise discussions, to trust the targets capacity and credibility, and to manage the information; 3) their expectations of the informational outcomes and relational consequences.
Two hundred and two college students in Singapore participated in the final survey. A structural equation modeling analysis was performed to test hypotheses. Measures derived from the central propositions of TMIM successfully predicted respondents information-seeking decisions. These data suggest that perhaps this information theory could be a promising theoretical framework to analyze young adults active searches for sexual health information.
However, findings from this study also suggest that young adults in a different cultural context may have distinct perceptions regarding the social meaning of information seeking, its impacts on relationships, and the usefulness of the informational outcomes. More empirical studies are required to investigate this theorys applications in different types of interpersonal communication in different contexts."

While several organizations work to develop these positive messages (e.g., The Advertising Council [Ad Council], U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the William J. Clinton Foundation), many questions remain about how to best target the young population to counterbalance food and beverage marketing exposure. To inform pro-health campaign design, six focus groups were conducted with children between the ages of six and 11 years (n=38) to address voids in research on childrens perceptions of images in advertisements combating childhood obesity. These important peer-to-peer recommendations for advertising imagery revealed that children process active and sedentary images very differently and, overall, are critical consumers of health campaign imagery."

In particular, our main goal is to provide a quantitative exploration of the concept by reassessing the framework of perceived video game realism described by Malliet (2006), evaluating the adequacy of the concepts and categories within this framework, and subjecting the adapted framework to an exploratory factor analysis. Principal axis factoring was performed on items completed by 385 respondents, whose ages ranged between 15 and 19 years. Seven factors of perceived game realism were identified: simulation, freedom of choice, character involvement, perceptual pervasiveness, authenticity regarding subject matters, authenticity regarding characters, and social realism. These findings are to a considerable extent congruent with the theoretical framework."

This study used a survey of 160 respondents who work in public relations (N=60) and marketing (N=100) positions in more than 30 companies in South Korea. The results reveal that there are four statistically significant perception discrepancies in following public relations roles: crisis management, relationship building, media relations, and issue management. Among them, two roles, media relations and issue management, have a statistically significant effect on the conflict between these professional practices."

Undergraduates (N = 225) completed alcohol expectancy (AE) measures for themselves and for others and evaluated four alcohol commercials. A 2 (Expectancy: Self vs. other) x 2 (Order: completed AE before or after) x 4 (Alcohol Commercials) design was used. As expected, AEs for others were stronger than AEs for the self. As expected, the stronger the Sexual AE, the stronger the sexual response to the four alcohol commercials and the stronger the Social AE, the stronger the social response to the four commercials. Surprisingly, the Social AE and the judgment that a commercial made one think about how drinking makes one feel social were the only significant predictors of desire to drink across all commercials. Implications of these results for expectancy research and message design are discussed."

Using the Third-Person Effect (TPE) as its theoretical basis, the study also looks at the influence of culturally-linked self-construals and Internet self-efficacy on perceptions and attitudes. A web-based survey of 232 online forum users in China provided the empirical data. The findings indicate that Chinese Internet forum users tend to perceive others to be more influenced by radically nationalistic messages than themselves, and this third-person perception (TPP) is significantly related to support for personal censorship, but not censorship by authorities. The results suggest that an independent self-construal is positively related to the TPP, and an interdependent self-construal is associated with pro-censorship views, but Internet self-efficacy is not significantly related to any of the criteria. The findings of this study extend TPE research into a new realm and have implications for political studies as well as communication theory."
2009-1114,Perceptions of Credibility: A Comparison of User-Generated and Expert-Generated Websites,Cueing Online Credibility,,,,Paper,Perceptions of Credibility: A Comparison of User-Generated and Expert-Generated Websites,Cueing Online Credibility,"Recent technological advancements have helped give rise to a variety of websites offering user-generated content. A 2 x 2 fully crossed between-subjects experimental study was conducted to examine the type of websites (users- versus expert-generated content site) and references (present versus absent) on site credibility. The results show that there is no significant difference in credibility between sites with user and expert-generated cues, regardless of the presence of references. This research suggests that information seekers do not perceive the information provided by other users like them to be less credible than those from the experts. Contrary to the prediction, there is an interaction effect between source of information and involvement. However, degree of involvement, prior knowledge of topic and time spent viewing the site were found to be positively related to site credibility. This implies that in the online context where source is not very distinguishable, message quality and dispositional factors are likely to play an important role in credibility assessment."

Using an online experiment, this study examines three possible factors that enhance bias detection. First, this study finds strong evidence that people can be primed to find bias in the media. Second, this study finds little evidence that strategic coverage about which candidate performs better on the issues relates to perceptions of media bias. Third, this study examines individual-level factors that may influence perceptions of bias. The results provide evidence that those who perceive partisan bias in the media in general are more likely to see bias in an individual news media article. Finally, this article examines the criteria that people employ for detecting bias in the media. Three general explanations emerge: the facts are true and fair (versus untrue and unfair), the valence of the coverage favors one candidate (or does not favor either candidate), and the amount of attention dedicated to each candidate is balanced (or imbalanced). Implications are discussed."

However, actual use of mobile internet, including functions such as news services, has been slow in most countries. There is little research on the role of mobiles as multimedia devices, especially with respect to accessing the news. This article focuses on questions related to usability and cost for using the mobile as a news medium, drawing upon cross-cultural data gathered in Sweden and Japan during Fall 2007. Although Japan and Sweden have superficially equivalent news media systems, the Japanese more favourably perceive the usefulness of accessing news on the mobile than do Swedes. Furthermore, the Japanese find mobile news as more expensive, and are less willing to pay for it. In reporting on this study, the article illustrates some of the methodological challenges in doing cross-cultural comparisons."

This is about housewives, a group which has not been considered at the forefront of womens empowerment in the 1970s and the 1980s. How Seibu appealed to those housewives is a topic of interest in this paper. Using Critical Discourse Analysis as the analytical tool, I analyze the visual, the verbal and the aesthetics spheres of the advertisement with socio-historical consideration. In particular, a subjectivity that the advertisement emanates is analyzed on three levels: of the women who appeared in the ad; of the advertisers own voice; and of the society that generated the advertisement."

Although perceptual experience of off-screen space contradicts the very presence of a frame, the promise of boundless access is continually deniedhence the operation of desire in the cinema. For feminist and cultural studies scholars, the frame acts simultaneously as a prison to which the body of the subject (and the spectator) is consigned by ideologies of the producing culture, industry, institution. Both, therefore, are framed, set up to confirm and conform to dominant assumptions. For narratologists the frame is more unstable and resistant, allowing for alternative ways of seeing. Digital technology further complicates these convergent yet contradictory readings of the frame. My paper will explore the implications of various readings of the frame, especially in the digital age, when the very concept is called into question."

This research examines this medicalization of infant feeding through a popular parenting magazine, Parents magazine, from 1930 through 2007. Findings indicate that infant feeding is consistently regarded as a medical or health issue. As attitudes towards infant feeding shifted from a focus on bottle feeding to breast feeding, modern medicine has been used to justify the dominant form of feeding. While the current popularity of breastfeeding is certainly beneficial to the overall health of infants, the emphasis of breast is best, particularly as health issue, reinforces the paradigm of the scientific motherhood and may cause hostility toward those who choose to or cannot breastfeed."
2009-1120,Perspective Taking and Attitude Change Among Adolescent Participants Using Video Technologies: A Case Study,"Body, Beauty, and Well-Being",,,,Paper,Perspective Taking and Attitude Change Among Adolescent Participants Using Video Technologies: A Case Study,"Body, Beauty, and Well-Being","Diet and body image are particularly salient for adolescents as this developmental stage is characterized by great physical growth and change (Barlow, 1990), and messages from peers are of fundamental importance to adolescents attitudes and perspectives of their own diet and body image (Gravener, 2008; Phares, Steinberg & Thomposon, 2004; Vincent & McCabe, 2000). Furthermore, in North America, the increasing adoption of online technologies by adolescents for social interaction purposes (i.e., videos to interact with friends) (Madden, 2007; Zamaria & Fletcher, 2008) suggests this medium is of particular importance to adolescents communication of important issues such as diet and body image. Thus, we evaluated learning, perspective taking and attitude change that took place during a VirtualClassroom session wherein 520 adolescents from high schools across Canada discussed issues related to diet and body image via video technologies. Our investigation revealed that the students were able to learn and understand each others perspectives regarding diet and body imageparticularly those who reported more frequent use of video technologiesand that knowing their peers viewpoints led to shifts in their own perspectives and attitudes. These findings suggest that the communication of opinions and attitudes which takes place between peers during in-person interaction can also occur during discussions over video technologies. We discuss these findings and propose that social presence is the mechanism through which these video mediated messages are successfully communicated and received."

While these obligations can be taught in school and exercised in formal settings, they are also learned and reflected informally, such as on-the-job. How does scientific citizenship appear when exercised in these informal settings? Importantly, what are the implications for those involved when issues of risk to human health and environment are at stake? To explore these questions, in-depth interviews were conducted with certified commercial pesticide applicators and other affiliates, such as pesticide safety educators. Interview responses highlight ways in which the obligations of scientific citizenship are expressed in the applicators daily interface with the public. The paper concludes by posing a new theoretical category for those who practice scientific citizenship through communicating risk information with public audiences. Directions for future research follow."
2009-1122,Philosophical Sociopaths,Popular Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Philosophical Sociopaths,Popular Communication Poster Session,"This paper approaches three recent films as thought experiments in a tradition of philosophical reasoning using technology dating back to the 18th century. Jessica Riskin has written on automata as philosophical engines that have been designed historically to distinguish between the human and non-human. This analysis treats film as potentially such a technology, and three recent films about sociopaths as thought experiments for for distinguishing between the human and inhuman. ""No Country for Old Men,"" ""There will be Blood"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"" all query the line between the human and inhuman, using a medium that mimics real life but is less than living. The experiments made sense in 2005-2006 when the inhumanity of Americans foreign policies invited consideration of the human status of Americans and the culture of the west where these films were set."

Based on field observations and extensive interviews conducted over a period of four months (February- May 2008) with 25 key Inquirer editorial, advertising, and design staff, I argue that the papers city-centric traditions, spatially segmented administrative structure, and system of editorial decision making may be delaying that papers discovery of open-ended, visually compelling Web presentation of news that modern Internet news readers require. Further, I argue that the aura of digital cities has replaced the newspapers aura as a work of populist, city-centric art and discourse (Benjamin, 1935). The Internet has produced floating cities of specific content and social interests, and with them, a crisis in the grounded world of metro newspapers like The Inquirer. The crisis extends to the central idea of news as a series of must know about events constrained by geographic, social, and cultural boundaries, with narrative/visual forms devised exclusively by past century editors and designers. By contrast, the Internets virtual cities are constrained neither by geography nor by visual or textual story telling traditions. The Inquirer must adopt an extreme paradigm shift in design and visual presentation, news content, and social media marketing to satisfy the enthusiasm enclaves of cyberspace and their fascination with the 'experiential,' visual story."

Using content and discourse analysis of online video clips posted by five U.S. network news websites, the authors found that gender becomes a primary focus in these mediated discourses about Palin. Her gender performance serve as an example of how masculinity and femininity practices are structured through societys gender-role models and how Palins masculinity is accepted and celebrated as it is still firmly rooted behind the confines of femininity."
2009-1125,Place Marketing the Reservation: The Tribal Digital Village,The New Media City,,,,Paper,Place Marketing the Reservation: The Tribal Digital Village,The New Media City,"Advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have often been framed as a chance to eradicate distance and difference  to make all places the same (Carey, 1989). Yet as ICTs have made distant cities partially equivalent (Castells, 2004), the idea of ICTs has been used to differentiate some places (like Silicon Valley and its cognates) as special and technological in a form of place marketing (Graham and Marvin, 2004). This project considers the use of advanced wireless broadband technology by Native American tribes in Southern California to reconfigure the structure of communication available to them. Their effort (called The Tribal Digital Village) juxtaposes new ICTs with indigeneity: an identity category solely defined by a special connection to place. While we think of new communication systems as able to maintain community across space, the Tribal Digital Village aims to maintain place across community, and to market Indian places as technological in configurations never before seen."
2009-1126,Places of the Imagination. An Ethnography of the TV Detective Tour,Experiencing Place in and Through Popular Communication,,,,Paper,Places of the Imagination. An Ethnography of the TV Detective Tour,Experiencing Place in and Through Popular Communication,"This article considers the phenomenon of the TV detective tour, guided tours of the locations and settings of popular TV detective programs. What explains the growing popularity of these tours, seen from the perspective of the tourists involved? To analyze this phenomenom, a new concept is introduced: ""lieux dimagination"", building on the concept of ""lieux de mémoire"" from heritage studies. This concept is further developed on the basis of ethnographic analysis of three of the most popular TV detective tours in Europe: the Inspector Morse Tour in Oxford, the Baantjer Tour in Amsterdam, and the Wallander Tour in Ystad, Sweden. In all, 31 interviews were conducted with tourist office employees, tour guides, local inhabitants, and tourists; these interviews were supplemented with participatory observation. Analysis of interview transcripts and observation records shows that the locations in question serve as a material reference for what is in fact an immaterial imagination. By visiting these locations and focusing on them, tourists are able to symbolically bridge the gap between their direct, sensory experience of reality and a shared imaginary world derived from the media."

Prominent scholars and programs are identified through a bibliometric analysis to account for many of the research trends. A call is made to broaden the research program related to crisis communication, using a life cycle of conflict management. Suggestions are made for shifting from qualitative, a-theoretical case studies to more theory-driven research, including more theory testing through quantitative analysis of testable hypotheses that build theory for the academy and the profession."

Hypotheses derived from this theory were tested in a secondary data analysis of an experiment on selective exposure to positive and negative news articles about same- and differently aged individuals. A sample of 178 young (18-30 yrs) and 98 older adults (50-65 yrs) browsed an online news magazine while reading times were logged by software. Younger individuals (high status group) generally focused their reading on same-aged individuals, with a preference on positive news about this in-group. Older recipients (low status group) were more likely to select negative news about young individuals than positive news about this out-group and negative news about older individuals. Furthermore, exposure to negative news about younger individuals had a positive effect on older recipients self-esteem."

Social network sites such as Facebook allow users to share their political beliefs, support specific candidates, and engage in interaction with others about political issues. But do the political activities users perform on Facebook affect political participation among young voters, a group traditionally perceived as apathetic in regards to civic engagement? Results from a survey of undergraduate students (N=683) at a large public university in the Midwestern United States found that political activity on Facebook (both performed and viewed in the news feed) is a significant predictor of political participation. We also explored students perceptions regarding the appropriateness of political activity on Facebook and the specific kinds of political activities they engaged in and witnessed within the site."

Specifically, paradoxes of sexuality and how sexuality is organized by and through work is examined. The data for the study comes from depth interviews with lesiban police officers who share their workplace narratives. These narratives reflect an awareness of the increasing amounts of same-sex visibility in popular culture, political and social attention, and the increasingly common discussions of sexuality that may occur in everday talk. This may influence the ways that lesbians are expected to live their lives, and the narratives illuminate similarities or differences with tensions faced in and through police-oriented workplaces. The paper ultimately explores how, as visibility in cultural/social spaces increases and political attention flourishes, lesbians may feel both socially obligated and politically inclined to disclose their sexuality at work and the implications of this disclosure. Organizational identity, work culture, work-life balance, and unique work experiences are also explored."
2009-1131,Policy Hacking: Politicizing Communication Technology in Community WiFi and Media Reform,Building Capital and Bridging Community With ICTs,,,,Paper,Policy Hacking: Politicizing Communication Technology in Community WiFi and Media Reform,Building Capital and Bridging Community With ICTs,"At the current critical juncture in media, technology, and politics, communication infrastructure is becoming politicized. This paper describes the emergence of discourses and practices of policy hacking at locations where geeks and hackers encounter media reform advocates. In particular, it draws from participant observation at Community Wireless Networking Summits and Media Reform Conferences  network forums where actors with different types of technical and political expertise created a common language and practice that politicized WiFi and internet technologies. In turn, ideas about policy hacking contributed to the politicization of Net Neutrality that focus on the desirability of an open internet  despite the practical constraints limiting this vision. Finally, the paper concludes with a reflection on the limitations of policy hacking as a way of framing political interventions. At the intersection of media and politics, communication and technology, this paper presents a critical assessment of new keywords for understanding a techno-political society."

This article locates the Australian case within comparative political communication literatures, which has rarely been done previously. Firstly, we situate the Australian media system, concluding that it is an outrider within Hallin & Mancinis Liberal model. Secondly, we report findings from our political knowledge test questions within the 2007 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes. We conclude from our analyses that Australian mediated political communication is highly polarized and ill-served by current regulatory arrangements and media policy priorities, especially given its unusual place as the democracy with the highest voter turnout in the world."
2009-1133,"Political Cynicism, Instability, and Volatility: Democratic Crisis or Critical Electorate?",Mass Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,"Political Cynicism, Instability, and Volatility: Democratic Crisis or Critical Electorate?",Mass Communication Poster Session,"Political cynicism has risen in many European democracies in the past decades, while in the same period voter behavior has become less stable. This study investigates the relationship between the two and distinguishes two kinds of voter behavior: hesitation which party to vote for (instability) and change between two successive elections (volatility). We determine whether voters hesitate and change at all and to what extent they hesitate and change between ideologically different parties and thus float between the left and the right end of the political spectrum. Our results, based on a national voter panel survey (N=733) conducted before and after the Dutch 2006 elections, suggest that political cynicism affects voter instability as well as volatility. Politically cynical voters are hesitant in their vote choice and change party more often in-between elections than less cynical voters. Moreover, political cynicism induces hesitation and change between ideologically different parties in particular. The article concludes with a discussion about the implications and relevance of our results in different political systems."

Yet by having the structural aspects of the public sphere brought so visibly into the forefront, the Internet may in fact help us to be more concrete about what the public sphere is, and how people engage with it. This article is directed toward understanding the impact of structural changes to the public sphere on the accessibility of politically relevant online discourse (news and political discussion) and about the extent to which these forms of discourse are meaningfully and intimately connected. Through the use of nationally representative survey data, findings suggest: (1) when compared to offline counterparts, SES and political knowledge are equally, if not more relevant to frequent use of online news and engagement in online political discussion, suggesting that Internet use has contributed to a slightly less accessible contemporary public sphere; (2) when compared to offline counterparts, the relationship between online news and online discussion is the strongest, suggesting an especially intimate and important connection between the two forms of discourse."

This is rather unfortunate because it is by tracing the advertising industry's behavior that we can get to the root of problems plaguing our present day media industries and the consumer culture it frequently promotes. My talk calls for increased scholarly attention to the advertising industry and its political workings and for greater inclusion of advertising and consumer studies in academic organizations."

Scholars have shown that both personal cynicism and media use have predicted peoples political views. Most research has not investigated this relationship using structural equation modeling. A data set from The National Election Survey was used for analysis of a hybrid model showing the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The fit indices showed that the model was a good fit. Using modified indices, a modified hybrid model was created. Personal cynicism affects both political efficacy and political cynicism. Media use influences political efficacy. The more individuals report watching news, the more they believe they cannot influence the political process."
2009-1137,Political Internet Games: Engaging an Audience,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,,,,Paper,Political Internet Games: Engaging an Audience,Game Studies High Density Paper Session,"We aimed to investigate how online political games contribute to the development of political engagement. Using Raessens (2006) functions and Van Zoonens (2007) perspectives as an analytical framework, we investigated six online games with respect to their expressive and engaging power in terms of the performance of a political self.
Our exploratory research was guided by two questions. The first aimed to uncover, through interviews, why independent developers of online political games created them, and how they took their potential players into consideration during this process. The second research question was focused on players. Using an online questionnaire, we asked them how they judged the impact of playing a political game on their knowledge and opinions about the issue addressed therein. We invited them to play a political game as part of our research procedure. Questions were also asked about the players intentions after they had played the game, thus connecting the experience of play to possible behavioral changes.
Interviews with developers revealed that the development of such a game contributes to the enhancement of the everyday political context. Similar results are found amongst players (n=80, online survey). The results also suggest that the construction and expression of a political self through the act of playing a political game may have consequences in the real world."

While some celebrate new possibilities for political life, others are concerned that intensive use of the technology can lead to small, insular networks of like-minded individuals with harmful effects on civil society. Drawing from a representative sample of adults in the U.S., this study examined how mobile-mediated discourse with close ties interacts with social network characteristics to predict levels of political participation and political openness. Findings revealed that use of the technology for discussing politics and public affairs with close network ties is positively associated with both political participation and openness, but that these relationships are moderated by the size and heterogeneity of ones network. Notably, levels of participation and openness decline with increased use of the technology in small networks of like-minded individuals. However, these trends are reversed under certain network conditions, showing the role of mobile communication in civil society is highly dependent upon the social context of its use."
2009-1139,Political Journalism and Accountability: From the 19th Century to the Present,Key Concepts in News and Journalism: Objectivity and its Adjacent Concepts,,,,Paper,Political Journalism and Accountability: From the 19th Century to the Present,Key Concepts in News and Journalism: Objectivity and its Adjacent Concepts,"At the end of the eighteenth century, the Wilkes Affair exposed the problems of political representation in England, while simultaneously announcing the close and symbiotic relationship between democratic politics and the freedom of the press. The celebrated issue No. 45 of the North Briton, reduced the role of the King to that of a mere representative with duties and obligations towards his subjects, and as such put forth the demand for a different conceptualization of political representation. From there onwards any representative was accountable to the people, while the press became the primary channel through which the will of the represented was to be transmitted to the representatives. By the end of the nineteenth century, the liberal democratic discourse established the function of the press as the watchdog of democratic politics, holding political representatives accountable for any abuses of power. The institutionalization and professionalization of the journalists themselves, set a number of abstract imperatives, like objectivity, neutrality and balance in order to ensure that the practitioners themselves were accountable to the public and bound to some notion of truth, which ultimately was at the service of the public interest. As the notion of objectivity becomes more problematic for political journalism in the twenty-first century (not least because technological innovations create new types of journalism), accountability as the regulating principle of the liberal democratic centres of representation, as well as in relation to the role of the journalists themselves, needs to be re-examined."
2009-1140,Political Substance in the Mediated Discourse Surrounding Controversial Docudramas,Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Political Substance in the Mediated Discourse Surrounding Controversial Docudramas,Political Communication Poster Session,"This paper proceeds from the assumption that entertainment texts  particularly controversial ones  function in a broad inter-textual field, and that their political significance does not lie solely in their direct influence on political knowledge, attitudes, opinions or behaviors, but in their ability to instigate politically-relevant discussions in other media venues. The paper examines the degree to which the mediated discourse generated by two controversial U.S. docudramas  The Reagans and The Path to 9/11 - constituted a substantive political discussion, and identifies the factors associated with higher or lower levels of political substance in the examined discourse. It offers a distinction between issue substance and media substance as the two major types of political substance that emerge in the discourse surrounding controversial texts, demonstrates how the level of the two types of political substance varied across the two docudramas, the time in which the discussion took place, different media outlets and different types of journalistic texts, and investigates which of these factors were significant predictors of political substance, while controlling for the other factors and for the length of the examined journalistic texts."

It differs from research into media systems or journalistic cultures in that it does not focus the attention on institutional arrangements or attitudinal profiles but on content features. This study aims to demonstrate how a cross-national analysis of election news coverage can serve as a meaningful example for characterizing different political news cultures. Based on multivariate data analysis, contours of three different types of political news cultures emerge: a strongly interventionist approach (prototype: USA), a moderately interventionist approach (prototype: Britain) and a non-interventionist approach (prototype: France). The relationship between assertive news management style (political public relations) and assertive journalistic response (journalistic intervention) was found to constitute an important dimension of political news cultures. Findings show that while national contexts still matter the most in explaining different reporting patterns, the study also produces evidence for the emergence of a transnational news culture. Findings suggest that national news cultures (at least as manifested in election news coverage) have aligned despite the fact that the political and media structures in the countries analyzed remain very different. The paper thus concludes that news cultures may be a more autonomous unit of analysis than previously thought."

The collapse of communism, followed by the installation of democratic institutions caused many changes in the social life, including mass media. The reform made in 1992 opened the market for a private ownership, and a dual television system, based on public and commercial broadcasters has been introduced. Despite the formal separation from the state power, which was first observed in transition towards democracy stage, it is hard to speak about free and fully-independent mass media in this part of Europe. Political elites want to control the media in many different levels, which might be seen as a common feature of all Post-Communist countries. The process of media politicization in Poland is observed in the way of media personel and regulatory authorities appointment, as well as in the field of influence on the media content and control over political news. Recent years brought many ideas for independent regulation in the media sector but several events proved that this idea has not yet been settled and more to say it has been misunderstood or simply neglected. Every new Polish government announces the amendment for the broadcasting law, which could reduce the process of media politicization. Those decisions in practice are often connected to the strategic orientation of the ruling parties, and reflect particular political interests, rather than a common good. This paper discusses what are the consequences of the process of media politicization in the public spere in Poland. Analysis is being made in the field of: acces to the mass media, promoting freedom of speech, generating public opinion, as well as showing and criticizing the ruling power and opposition during the national election campaigns. Does the process of media politicization influence electoral behaviour and voting results? Is there a place for promoting every social and political ideas? Does the situation in Poland might still be descibed as a determinant of the democratic society? What are the expectations for the future?"

The Storying of Age-Related Infertility in Public Discourses,Motherhood-Parenthood through Gendered Prisms,"This essay explores public discourses about age-related infertility. These discourses serve as compelling texts that illustrate feminist tendencies to rely on narrative resources to recount events, depict characters, suggest causes for events, and represent the passage of time. Through a post-structural feminist reading, we explore discursive moves through which ARI was storied in mainstream outlets to shed light on relationships among symbols, power, knowledge, reproductive rights, and work-family issues. We then illustrate the general failure of these personal stories to politicize the socio-historical, institutional, and material nature of reproductive choices. We conclude by noting the limits of narratives as rhetorical resources in social movements and public health initiatives when attention does not extend beyond individual expressions to redress forces that shape and constrain human agency."
2009-1144,Pop Culture as an Instrument for Global Public Diplomacy,Public Diplomacy and Intersections With Public Opinion,,,,Paper,Pop Culture as an Instrument for Global Public Diplomacy,Public Diplomacy and Intersections With Public Opinion,"The diplomatic landscape has recently undergone crucial changes including the shift from the traditional government-to-government diplomacy to public diplomacy. Despite the growing importance to engage in communication with foreign publics, however, governments have not remold their diplomatic structure to adopt to this change and are not equipped with appropriate tools and tactics. Motivated by the lack of an effective instrument for public diplomacy, this paper explores how popular culture can successfully serve as the next generation tool for the task. The Korean Wave, a feverish popularity of Korean pop culture in Asian countries, is employed as a case that demonstrates the capacity of pop culture being an effective tool of public diplomacy. From an analysis of secondary data, it is evident that the Korean Wave has facilitated the goals of public diplomacy by 1) promoting Korean cultural values through activating Korean language learning and tourism, 2) improving the national image, and 3) ameliorating damaged national image in countries that had experienced diplomatic friction. The paper concludes with suggestions for governments to devise a way to facilitate mutual communication and build common understanding and relationship in order to utilize pop cultures as a sustainable instrument for public diplomacy."

Within the categories popularization and personalization we found, through a bottom-up, one-by-one constant comparison of publications, that popularization pertains to topical, narrative, audiovisual and participatory features. Personalization includes the distinct but related processes of individualization, privatization and emotionalization. Defined as such, popularization and personalization are concepts that can be used for the analysis of current forms of political television journalism without taking an a priori, normative position of television as either dumbing down the political process or providing new potential for a more inclusive political process. We conclude this paper with a conceptualization of popularization and personalization, and discuss its implications for future research."

Media studies, most notably in the work of Henry Jenkins, has taken up CI and highlighted its potential as a new public sphere. This presentation problematizes the equation of CI with public sphere by examining the case study of the 9/11 Truth Movement. A decentralized network of researchers, bloggers, and activist organizers, the 9/11 TM is defined by its skepticism of official accounts of the September 11th attacks. Specifically, 9/11 TM considers itself to be filling the gaps left by official investigative organs. 9/11 TM's use of viral marketing techniques, online distribution of documentaries, and collaborative, decentralized knowledge-production make it an excellent example of bottom-up, collective intelligence. The case of the 9/11 TM prompts new strategies of neutralization to accompany traditional ones, and ultimately forces us to rethink collective intelligence in terms of popular powers."

Gold Miss is one of the recent neologisms to describe single, working women consuming luxurious items and enjoying westernized, cosmopolitan lifestyle. By examining the media discourse of Gold Miss, this study aims to discuss how the discourse suggests about the Korean societys attitude toward working women as consumers in globalization era. Even though the womens consumption can be discussed in terms of womens self-realization and investigation on themselves, Gold Miss is no more than a perfect consumer group satisfying the demand of both the commercial market and the Korean societys globalization discourse. After all, even though media portray Gold Miss as powerful group leading social trends, it is only a false empowerment on women consumers which represses women under the market needs and the traditional values."

2009-1149,Post-Technology?: The Romance of Associations,Keyword: Technology (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Post-Technology?: The Romance of Associations,Keyword: Technology (Cross Unit),"The heydays of discussing technology in philosophy of communications are long over. Critical readings of technology were prominent late 1980s and early 1990s (Feenberg) when Science and Technology Studies (STS) also reached their peak. The concept of technology is more likely now found vestigially in accounts of communication and society that build on STSs offshoot, Actor Network Theory. This sees reified technologies as actors that enable networks. While this has benefits (a suspicion of functionalist readings of medias role in the social), its disadvantage is a lack of interest in the special work of technologies of representation (ie media) and a quasi-technological account of contemporary life which emphasises associations over any account of the thick contexts previously called social (Latour 2005). As an antidote, this paper offers philosophically-influenced practice theory which looks seriously again at how to varying degrees media technologies are reified and thick contexts built from their use."

The concept became politicized through this process, which took the better part of a century. Of particular importance to communications scholars today is the dimension of liberation embedded the recent formulations of the other. Owning a sense of otherness, for example, has allowed for new positionalities to emerge from groups in the margins, and for strategies of self-determination to be developed. The presentation will look at several examples, using the media to illustrate."

This study explores the application of online counseling to HIV/STD risk-taking behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM). PowerON, an organization that provides sexual health information to MSM exclusively online, used instant message technology to counsel MSM in real time through computer-mediated means. A sample of 279 transcripts of instant message exchanges between PowerON counselors and Gay.com users were recorded and qualitatively analyzed. Approximately 43% of the instant message sessions discussed information about HIV/STD testing. Risk-taking behaviors were addressed in 39% of the sessions. Information about HIV/STDs and general counseling were given in 23% and 18% of the counseling sessions respectively. The data showed these instant message sessions to be a potentially effective forum for HIV/STD counseling. Information ordinarily disseminated at health clinics could be successfully distributed through the Internet to MSM, particularly closeted MSM who might not want to risk identification by going to a clinic."

Research into the seemingly paradoxical enjoyment of this kind of media entertainment has typically focused on gender- and genre-specific needs and viewing motivations. Extending this line of research we studied the role of the need for affect as a more general, gender- and genre-independent predictor of individual differences in the experience of emotions and meta-emotions (i.e., evaluative thoughts and feelings about one's emotions). We conducted a field study of moviegoers who attended the regular screening of a drama or a horror film (N = 119). Results support the assumption that individuals high in need for affect experience higher levels of negative and ambivalent emotions and evaluate their emotions more positively on the level of meta-emotions. Controlling for the Big Five personality factors did not alter these effects. The results are discussed within an extended meta-emotion framework."

Four-hundred and six pediatricians completed a mail survey measuring attitudes, subjective norms, intentions, and behavior. Results indicate that pediatricians have positive attitudes and subjective norms toward encouraging parents to get their daughters vaccinated, that they intend to regularly encourage parents to get their daughters vaccinated against HPV in the next 30 days, and that they had regularly encouraged parents to get their daughters vaccinated against HPV in the past 30 days (behavior). As hypothesized, and consistent with the TRA, pediatricians attitudes and subjective norms predicted behavioral intent, and behavioral intent predicted behavior. No gender differences were observed for any of the individual variables or the overall fit of the model. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications for the development of health communication messages targeting health care providers in general, and for those designed to influence pediatricians communication with parents regarding the HPV vaccine in particular."

Using nationally representative survey data related to youths reception of anti-tobacco campaigns, we found that engagement in conversation was positively related to more positive evaluation of campaign messages and, perhaps more notably, that the smoking status of conversation participant moderated the relationship. More specifically, the positive impact of conversation on campaign evaluation was found only with non-smokers and smokers with quitting intentions, but not with smokers without quitting intentions. We discuss implications of these effects for health campaigns and campaign evaluation research, noting the need to further address the role of social networks."
2009-1155,Predicting the Spatial Pattern of Global News Flow,tercultural Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Predicting the Spatial Pattern of Global News Flow,Intercultural Communication Poster Session,"Why certain regions and countries in the world dominate information and media markets and contents is a long-standing issue in communication study. An approach that gained currency in international news studies is the structural/logistic approach. Communication scholars in this line of research tried to explain the direction, volume, and content of international news based on Galtung and Wallersteins theories of the spatial and temporal organization of the world. However, despite holistic approaches emphasized by Galtung, Wallerstein, and other dependency theorists, most international news studies were rarely global. This study examined the pattern of international news flow as a whole from social network perspective. This study performed a QAP multiple regression on newspaper trades among 64 countries. According to the findings of this study, the structural pattern predicted by Galtung and Wallerstein is still useful to explain the structure of global international newspaper trade. The QAP multiple regression analysis showed that international contexts such as geographic, economic, and cultural connections among countries were significant determinants of the pattern of international news flow as a whole."
2009-1156,Prediction Markets: The Future as Control,Popular Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Prediction Markets: The Future as Control,Popular Communication Poster Session,"This paper argues that prediction markets (or futures markets, decision markets, information markets) that as liberal market logic moves from the domain of the financial toward the domain of apparently innocuous entertainment and positive educational goals, it becomes an increasingly powerful technology, a molding that can change with ease, disguise itself within the dense web of a network, and appropriate the rhetoric of collective wisdom, efficiency, democracy (independence, diversity, decentralization, aggregation), and civic responsibilityall of which can form subjects, with an apparent agency to enact a freedom of will, pliable and malleable for the ends of the liberal market. The ideas of circulation, ever-wider circuits, governmentality, and control society are thought of, theoretically, in terms of the conceptual work of Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. In addition, the development of the network itself is a larger goal. Whatever control through direct profit may be gained through the speculation of subjects on a variety of entertainment and educational goals, is secondary to the innovation and increased knowledge of the network by these interested institutions."

In this paper, we focused on the following methods: (1) weighting frequency of media use with respondents own ratings of media content; and (2) weighting frequency of media use with content analysis scores. We then investigated which of the media exposure scores should be used in studying the effects of media exposure on sexual behaviors. To address this issue, we examine which content score has better predictive validity for predicting sexual activities. Our regression analyses demonstrate that among those adolescents who underestimate sexual content compared to coders, neither exposure score is significantly related to sexual activity. Sexual content exposure scores only predicted adolescents sexual activity for those youth who overestimate the amount of sexual content in media compared to coders. Additionally there is no statistically significant difference between the two exposure scores in their predictive validity."

The current study explored prevalence, predictors and impacts of media multitasking and multiple media use. Based on a secondary data analysis, the study found that 89.8% of people multitasked at least one other activity while they used television, with 48.8% of people consuming print media or Internet at least once while using television simultaneously. However, on average, people multitasked less than one non-media activity and used less than one other medium when watching television. College age students were not found to be significantly different from other demographic groups, but television technology ownership predicted a higher likelihood of multiple media use. More importantly, an added factorcoviewingwas found to significantly predict higher likelihood of media multitasking and multiple media use. Finally, it was found that multitasking predicted increasing total television exposure time. Implications for displacement theory and other media research are discussed."

Using the situational theory of problem solving, first, we created a theoretical account for perceptual, cognitive, and motivational causes for active information behaviors among lay individuals. We then applied the situational theory as a tool of segmenting general population into more meaningful subgroups (e.g., active, aware publics about a health-donation issue) and examined whether segmented public profiles could predict their likelihood of active information giving, taking, and selecting about health-donation issues. With a survey dataset of 338, we tested the theoretical model and predictions using public segmentation in three health-donation issues. Findings suggest that perceptual and motivation variables could predict the likelihood of information behaviors. In addition, public segmentation method using the situational theory could assist health communicators in planning and practice of health campaign more strategically."

A group of these images have been used in contemporary Mexican texts as distinctive elements that permit to maintain a bond with ancestral cultures that, in their social reading, guarantee a strong connection with the cultures that serve as sustenance for the social concept in use of meanness. Through the application of logical reading processes offered by cognitive semiotics and the relief of evident strategies brought about by plastic and figurative semiotics, it is possible to make an inventory of commonly used reading processes that generate what is denominated as Mexicanness. These processes acquire major relevance when they are appropriated by supports carried by digital communication technologies."

Popular Media Production and Scholarship Today,,,,Paper,Premeditating Performances in Reality and Interactive TV: A Scripting Approach to Media Production,Are We Free Yet? Popular Media Production and Scholarship Today,"Current ideals of media performance often tend towards the informal, the individualised and intimate. An effect of the spontaneous and unscripted seems to be dominant in the performances of broadcast genres such as reality and interactive TV. A critical production studies approach to this issue would be to look into how such effects of the unplanned may themselves be a result of premeditation. This paper discusses the ways that the performances of media professionals and so-called ordinary people are concretely premeditated in current interactive and reality TV formats. Three forms of scripting are discussed: cueing, the scripting of social settings, and the scripting of temporal sequencings. The paper argues that current formats that strive for the unscripted feel could in fact be said to involve radical extensions of scripting, beyond conventional practices. In more general terms, the paper suggests looking to the premeditation of mediated performances as a key concern in the study media production.

But from what age onn do children begin to understand the emotions of television characters symbolised by means of gestures and facial expressions, and what are the implications for the understanding of narratives? In the pursuit of these questions, reception of non-verbal cartoon episodes from a preschool childrens programme was analysed. 40 preschool children between the ages of 3 and 6 were shown two stories in which a characters fear was the prime motivating force for the unfolding of the plot. Afterwards the children re-enacted their version of the story using toy animals and were interviewed about the characters emotions and motivations. As well as age-related differences, typical variations were revealed in the way children interpret gestures and facial expressions or fail to recognize them, and in the way they construct motivations, emotions, and plot and context of the story on the basis of these. Apart from the complexity of the essential questions, this study also made clear both the opportunities and limitations of tools such as play and interviewing."

During the 2004 elections Channel One was owned by Primedia, a corporation that formed alliances with Ralph Reed, Jack Abramoff and anti-tax think tanks. In 2007 the news program was acquired by Alloy Media and Marketing, which formed alliances with NBC, Bill Clinton and Participant Productions (a Hollywood-based social action group). This constructionist framing study investigates how political campaign issues and political actors were framed differently during the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections under these different conditions."

Accordingly, scholars have devoted substantial attention to how presidents have publicly justified this decision. However, these studies have generally been too quick to assume that presidents rationales for war have been essentially uniform over time. This paper puts that assumption to the test by systematically analyzing rationales for war in the population of modern presidents wartime communications. The results show that presidents have actually varied considerably in the extent to which they use common rationales. Further analysis shows this variation to be determined more by specific wartime circumstances than by presidents individual characteristics."

Results were drawn from a stratified multistage cluster sample of 1395 citizens nested within 15 regions of Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. Descriptively, the privately-owned media were seen as exercising responsible conduct and to a great extent enhanced political interest both within and across all 15 regions. These are regions still engulfed in ethno-political sectarianism. HLM results show that the social status was not a significant predictor at all levels of the analysis. Press accountability enhances political interest, with increased outcome when education is accounted for both at the individual level and across all regions."

Since both the 1970s and 1980s, however, developments which include the ending of the Cold War and the advancement of information and communication technologies (such as the advent of the internet, the handheld video recorder and the satellite telephone have been responsible, it is argued, in an increase of technology and event-driven news reporting. Scholars who have undertaken this type of analysis often argue that this shift in news reporting and content reveals a more independent, cantankerous and autonomous press than what was previously observed during the Cold War era. On face value, it would seem that the divergent strains between those that research instances of press subordination and exceptionalism would sharply clash and accomplish little in terms of complementing one another and realizing theoretical advances. This paper argues the opposite to be true and elucidates how the literature on press independence and event-driven reporting actually serve to usefully inform and assist theoretical frameworks such as the indexing and propaganda models. In thoroughly surveying and critically analyzing this literature, a better understanding can be gleaned of limitations, including limits to the general patterns of news reporting discerned by both hegemonic models and also by press exceptionalism itself."

In so doing, this study analyzes editorials by three Korean dailies with ideological diversity and different ownerships regarding a long-time controversial issue, openness of agriculture embedded in globalization since the1990s. Results reveal that the ideologically conservative newspaper, Donga, was parallel to conservative political parties, which is opposite for the progressive newspaper, Hankyoreh. With the somewhat moderate newspaper, Hankook, being inbetween, the two contrasting newspapers, Donga and Hankyoreh, confirmed press-party parallelism across the political regimes, although Korean dailies have become excessively commercialized since the 1990s. The implications for press-party/state relations in the political communication field are discussed."

While background media use during homework seemed always quite popular among students (e.g., Jeong et al., 2005; Beentjes et al., 1996), this phenomenon now also appears to swap into the academic classroom and to impact traditional learning environments at universities. Students use laptop computers or short message features of mobile phones or PDAs during lectures, or listen to music. But what exactly motivates students to use different media during lectures? How prevalent is this phenomenon, what media types are preferred, and how exactly is the students attention allocated? What are the perceived beneficial  for example, motivational (Vorderer et al., 2006)  and harmful (e.g., limited information processing capacity; Lang, 2000) effects of multitasking during lectures, as perceived by the students? A cross-cultural study in the U.S., in The Netherlands and in Germany with more than 200 student respondents was conducted to explore these questions. Results indicate that multitasking in university classroom is a rather common phenomenon with complex origins and multifaceted effects. Results will be discussed in terms of motivational and learning consequences of multitasking media use.

Overall, sell strategies are most frequently used, more specifically by politicians referring to their success or by expressing their attitude in the past or telling what they are currently doing. But also attacking tactics such as interrupting and demonstrating inconsistencies or contradictions are frequently used. The majority parties use more selling strategies than the opposition parties, which is in line with earlier findings in other countries. Political parties adopt more attacking and defending strategies in the period before Election Day than afterwards. The selling strategy is equally important in the electoral and post electoral period."

The model presented in this paper extends and improves upon prior research (Mastro & Kopacz, 2006; Tan, Fujioka, & Tan, 2000) in several ways. One, it examines the role of intergroup emotions as an important mediator by including prejudicial feelings towards racial/ethnic out-groups in the model. Second, unlike past research that typically grouped all negative TV stereotypes in one global measure, this study explores how specific types of negative stereotypes such as criminality and laziness work independently and simultaneously to influence policy preferences. Finally, it examines this integrated cognitive-affective model of policy reasoning as it applies to attitudes towards more than one racial/ethnic out-group, which provides greater confidence in the applicability of the model. Implications of the results and directions for future research are discussed."

The final season of The West Wing saw a charismatic, older Republican senator face off against a minority Democratic contender blessed with the ability to deliver inspirational speeches, married with two small children, and filled with youthful vigor. Season One of 24 gave us an African American candidate under threat of an assassination attempt, and later an African American president. Commander in Chief saw Geena Davis as the Vice President called upon to step into the Presidents shoes when he died unexpectedly. All three shows, therefore, provided touchstones for thinking about what an Obama/Biden, a McCain/Palin, or a (Hillary) Clinton presidency might entail. I will discuss the messages offered by each, paying particular attention to the fears and hopes into which these fictional candidates tapped before their real life counterparts entered the scene.

Where antiquarian books were once the province of an elite, localized few, todays digital landscape allows rare books to be bought and traded with unheralded ease and frequency by geographically and demographically diverse consumers. However, if the impact of such dramatic changes seems obvious, the manner in which book collectors integrate digital culture into their hobby is anything but. Using ethnographic data from both Chicago-based book collectors and web users who frequent the collector-oriented portions of Abebooks.com, my research looks at how the Internet exerts influence on book collection. Comparing the ostensible differences between online and offline collection cultures, I suggest the two arenas fulfill distinct needs for book collectors, demonstrating how digital culture might better be understood as a supplement to rather than a substitute for previous collection habits. This finding is significant not only to the small community of antiquarian book buyers and sellers, but can be further extended to the way various groups understand technology to have impacted the manners in which they perform, value, and understand media use."

Global network converges technological capacities, expectations, desires, cultural logics and everyday performativity. With emphasis on the aesthetically constructed digital subject, this paper explores the reinvention of the notion of privacy accompanying the above described convergence and ever-increasing ubiquity of digital technology. It argues there is an accompanying seismic shift from the traditional idea of privacy as passive avoidance and withdrawal to the present Web 2.0 phenomenon of managed presence through tools such as MySpace, Facebook, Stickam, blogging and other social networking applications. In the digitally networked world, the traditional notion of privacy does not exist, for to not actively participate is to deny ones own existence. Rather, in the always on and everywhere network that comprises our digital environment, one might expect to be recognized and treated personally, if not famously, everywhere one goes."

Popular Media Production and Scholarship Today,,,,Paper,"Private Places, Public Forums: Speech Rights in the New Spaces of Media Production",Are We Free Yet? Popular Media Production and Scholarship Today,"Much digital participatory culture is emerging in privately owned spaces (virtual worlds, online games, wikis, and blogs), where the publics rights to access, free speech, and association are less established than they are in public places (such as streets and parks). Because these private digital spaces are increasingly important sites of public discourse and collective action, a democratic digital culture requires that their denizens should possess robust rights of access, speech, and association. In most developed democracies, courts and legislatures have recognized that these rights have been and must be stronger than the publics limited right of access to speak in traditional mass media. This paper traces the legal basis for extending such rights, especially by drawing on the public forum doctrine  an area of U.S. constitutional law that has been used to protect public speech rights on private properties, such as shopping malls.

The paper reports differences between Black and general audience newspapers in their proportion of risky product (alcohol and tobacco) and service (control) advertisements. The paper also examines the use of models and social message cues (localized information, personally mobilizing information, and resource referrals) in across advertisement types in Black and general audience newspapers. A number of specific findings regarding the use of racial models are discussed. Major findings include that general audience newspapers were significantly more likely to feature referral to resources (p < .01), personal behavior mobilization cues (p <. 001), and a health official in the tobacco and alcohol related ads studied compared to Black newspapers (p < .001). Service or control ads were more likely to feature a referral to resources (p <.001), personal behavior mobilization (p <.001), and health officials in advertisements (p <.001 ) compared to product advertisements."

Usage of a cell phone as an e-wallet, prepaid train pass and membership card for various services is now common in Japan.
Mobile technology also serves as the main tool for web access and email for many Japanese. As this has had a positive effect in increasing the digital inclusion statistics in Japan, a main problem of digital inclusion is being hidden at the same time. Web access through mobile technology may be promoting a ubiquitous digital environment, however, is not properly promoting the real benefits of digital inclusion. Due to the technical and interface constraints to remain a mobile tool, Internet access through mobile technology slow down the initial access to the wealth of knowledge to strategically improve citizens, and instead lead a majority of their users through their preset portals to the conveniently packaged commercial information. This is especially common among the older users of mobile technology.
On the other hand, Japanese youth have been at the forefront of mobile technology other than voice for over a decade, going back to when text communication through pagers were a fad among junior high and high school students. However, at the same time, problems in Japan are occurring among the youth of Japan and how they use current mobile technology. Ura-site or dark-sites of schools or classrooms are made to collect and concentrate gossip about school or classes and teachers, which are usually harmless, however have been turned into a tool for facilitating a type of cyberbullying, through using these sites to target specific members of their classes. For example, children can coordinate their behavior against a particular student using these sites, so they can communicate on how to begin ignoring or bullying students, or begin disobedience against teachers. The photo function, which is a convenient tool for most adults, becomes a tempting tool for youth to take hidden photographs of other classmates that can later be used for humiliation or extortion. Profs which provide profiles of cellular phone users, were meant to be used as service for promoting community building. However, access to these profiles that sometimes unknowingly provided private information, became the targets for access by sexual predators and have also been turned into weapons for cyberbullying. Escalation of negative activities of mobile technology has been linked to suicides among some youth in Japan.
This study will look at the possibilities and hopes that mobile technology have for us, but will also concentrate on the problems of digital inclusion linked with mobile technology, and the privacy issues that encompass the mobile environment. Statistical data from government agencies and private institutes will provide the rationale for discussing these problems and will make an attempt to provide solutions."

More specifically, studies have pointed to a mediating role of perceived realism, but internally valid evidence is missing. Based on data from a three-wave panel study among 959 Dutch adolescents, we investigated for two dimensions of the perceived realism of SEIM  social realism and utility  whether they mediated the impact of SEIM on adolescents instrumental attitudes toward sex (i.e., the notion of sex as primarily physical and casual rather than affectionate and relational). Structural equation modeling showed that more frequent use of SEIM increased both the perceived social realism and the perceived utility of SEIM. In turn, these two perceptions led to more instrumental attitudes toward sex. No evidence of reversed causality emerged."

Different kinds of information, including content, ads, and menus, are competing to grab peoples attention. The underlying mechanism of processing multiple information components is unclear. Using the eye tracking equipment, this study examines whether information complexity of online news story, which influences perceptual load, will affect the possibility of processing irrelevant ads. Increase in information complexity require high perceptual load, which decrease the processing of irrelevant ads. The results suggest that high information complexity exhausts perceptual load and leads to less processing of irrelevant ads."
2009-1182,Processing Visual Detail: How Motivation Guides Encoding Specificity,Keywords in Information Systems: Motivation (High Density),,,,Paper,Processing Visual Detail: How Motivation Guides Encoding Specificity,Keywords in Information Systems: Motivation (High Density),"This study investigates how visual information details are prioritized as a function of the continuous increase in the intensity of mediated events and as a function of valence (whether the events are experientially pleasant or unpleasant). The study proposes and uses a new measure of visual content centrality and periphery that are based on structural features of mediated content. The proposed measure of centrality and periphery is calibrated with an earlier measure of central and peripheral detail (Heuer & Reisberg, 1990) and is then used to explore how central vs. peripheral content are encoded as a function of emotional content.
A total of 72 pictures were selected as stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS: P. J. Lang et al., 1999) and were assigned to arousing content by valence cell using the subject arousal ratings norms published with the system. Recognition test was used to track encoding. Data suggests that central details are protected more (e.g. better processed) than peripheral details as arousing content increases. The encoding of central detail is less prone to overload compared to peripheral. The findings reveal a remarkable hierarchy that is consistent with the motivational perspective on cognition and suggests that as arousing content increases the organism gives up on encoding for peripheral negative detail first followed by peripheral positive detail, which is followed by central negative and then central positive detail."

This paper presents research that adopts a different approach to Bourdieus analytical framework by incorporating pragmatist understandings of the self in order to understand how day to day practice can be a locus for the production of symbolic power. The practices of public relations practitioners in the Corporate Affairs department of a UK-based passenger transport operator were explored in terms of their implications for the practitioners status and legitimacy in the organisation. The analysis shows how practice and social capital underpin claims to symbolic power, and the manner in which discourses sustain those claims. The practitioners actively reflexive approach to their work is explained in pragmatist terms to provide a more effective means of understanding the role of agency in Bourdieus work."
2009-1184,Producing Women: Rethinking Feminism in Production Studies,Are We Free Yet? Popular Media Production and Scholarship Today,,,,Paper,Producing Women: Rethinking Feminism in Production Studies,Are We Free Yet? Popular Media Production and Scholarship Today,"A feminist definition of ""production"" would have to account for the relationship between labor and a gendered subjectivity. This point was not lost on early 20th century feminist writers, such as Margaret Sanger, who wrote that working class women become slaves, lacking their fundamental rights as possessive individuals, when they lack the ability to control their reproductive bodies. This early recognition of the ways gender shapes production-whether in a factory or child rearing-has been somewhat forgotten in communication studies, which frequently segregated cultural studies of identity from a political economy of labor. Conversely, we must expand our scope to ask how production labor itself is gendered. Drawing on more recent feminist authors, such as Miranda Joseph, Leslie Salzinger, and Miranda Banks, it seems incumbent that communication studies of production need to look deeper into the ways work produces women and the phenomenological gendering of producers.

Description of panelists qualifications regarding proposed topic:
Vicki Mayer has just completed the edited volume Production Cultures: Cultural Studies of Media Industries (Routledge, 2009), which developed from her prior work on Latino media production (Producing Dreams, Consuming Youth, Rutgers UP, 2003) and her current work on the identities of the workers involved in TV production in the new economy (Below the Line, to be published by Duke University Press)."

This form of music prevalent in an Eastern state of India (West Bengal) is significant because it is the first instance of commercially successful rock music sung in an Indian language. I argue that the rising popularity of Bangla rock complicates theories of cultural globalization because it highlights the need to study cultural forms produced by consumers of hegemonic culture. Studying production as opposed to only consumption at sites of global cultural flows better elucidates the role of desire in a cultural formation. Focusing on production pushes us towards a positive theory of desire as creativity, while consumption models imply desire driven by absence or lack. By exploring the motivations for the cultural formation of Bangla rock I seek to add to the existing explanations for why globalization of culture occurs."
2009-1186,Professional Media in the Orbit of Power Structure and Academic Marketplace,fluences on Publishing and Programming,,,,Paper,Professional Media in the Orbit of Power Structure and Academic Marketplace,Influences on Publishing and Programming,"Since the 1990s, China has reoriented social sciences toward the goal of national development, under which academic publishing is seen as an instrument of enhancing national prestige. This has facilitated the wide adoption of quantitative academic evaluations based on counting publications in a few recognized academic journals. This pervasive top-down practice not only sets the priorities of academic production, but also puts certified scholarly journals in the epicenter. Drawing from relevant literature and the fieldwork, which is made up of in-depth interviews with 16 editors and editors-in-chief coming from 6 journals in media and communication studies and 20 scholars in the field, this paper aims to develop a political-economic analysis of scholarly journals, so as to get a theoretically informed understanding of the structural determinants of the academic production and dissemination in contemporary China. The analysis concentrates on the legitimation, stratification and commercialization of scholarly publishing, in relation to state power, academic marketplace and the work-unit system. The study found, state-licensing and wok-unit system has formed the semi-closed scholarly publishing market. Based on this infrastructure, the reorientation of social sciences and the installation of quantitative academic evaluations have differentiated the monopolistic market, resulted in the polarization of scholarly journals, and also lead to some academic corruptions by taking advantage of the publication space as scarce resources."

Against this backdrop, the present study sought to clarify and extend the knowledge base concerning health information use online by profiling adults utilizing internet information about medical services. Secondary analysis of survey data from a very large (n = 6,119) sample representative of the Atlanta, Georgia area informed this investigation. In stark contrast to previous research, much lower prevalence estimates of internet medical information (IMI) seeking behavior were found. Specifically, IMI use was reported by 14.5% of the entire sample and 21.1% of adults with internet access (n = 3,289). Logistic regression models, controlling for several sociodemographic characteristics, revealed that home computer ownership, online time per week, and health care system utilization are all positively linked with internet medical information seeking behavior."

Most contemporary organizations do part of their business via e-mail where these methods could be applied. But large parts of their interactionin teleconferences, fact to face meetings, and so onremain untranscribed and beyond the reach of NLP systems. One exception to this is the university, were the products of researchers are routinely set in text that can be analyzed for knowledge management purposes. This presentation reports a case study applying a NLP knowledge management based on Centering Resonance Analysis (Corman, et al., 2002) to the largest college in a large southwestern university. Results show enormous potential of routinely applying such a system, but also illustrate the challenges that confront development, even in this best-case scenario."

However, there is a dearth of literature in this area which potentially limits the scope of using exergames to promote physical activity on a broader scale. Little research has been conducted to examine whether exergames work equally well across diverse populations. In addition, to our best knowledge, no study examines whether the key features of exergames indeed motivate the users to engage in exercises. The current study thus investigates the impacts of an individual psychological difference factor and a specific contextual factor on exercise experience using an exergame. The objective self-awareness theory and the self-discrepancy theory were used as the theoretical underpinning. In a 2 (seeing the image of self on screen: seeing oneself vs. not seeing oneself) x 2(body image dissatisfaction: low vs. high) between-subjects design experiment, we found significant interaction effects such that the feature of seeing the image of self on screen provided by the exergame works positively for individuals with low body image dissatisfaction yet works negatively for individuals with high body image dissatisfaction. The finding of the current study has significant implications for health professionals and users who use the new generation of exergame for physical activities. This study also contributes to the objective self-awareness theory by providing additional evidence in a new medium."
2009-1190,Promoting Participatory and Deliberative Democracy: The Roles of Newspapers and Television News,"Deliberation, Political Engagement, and Participation in the Public Sphere (High Density)",,,,Paper,Promoting Participatory and Deliberative Democracy: The Roles of Newspapers and Television News,"Deliberation, Political Engagement, and Participation in the Public Sphere (High Density)","Although democratic theorists often argue that a healthy public sphere requires both political participation and deliberation, empirical research shows that these theories are contradictory in practice. Exposure to political views different from ones ownthe sin qua non of deliberationpromotes political tolerance, but reduces political participation. By contrast, exposure to like-minded views encourages voting and other political activities, but limits knowledge of oppositional viewpoints. In response to this impasse, we suggest that different institutions may contribute to the goals of both participatory and deliberative democracy. Specifically, we argue that television news programs are more likely than newspapers to expose people to communication across lines of political differences. This is due to the greater ease with which newspaper readers can exercise partisan selective exposure, relative to television viewers. Newspapers tend to have more clearly-defined political identities, thus making it easier for people to choose a source that fits with their own political views. To investigate these hypotheses, we rely on representative surveys from 11 countries."
2009-1191,Propaganda Leaflets and Cold War Frames During the Korean War,The Long Mid-20th Century in Communication History,,,,Paper,Propaganda Leaflets and Cold War Frames During the Korean War,The Long Mid-20th Century in Communication History,"The Korean War was a propaganda war. During the war periods (1950-1953), approximately 2.5 billion units of the leaflets were disseminated. Even after the armistice ended the fighting on the hot battlefields, psychological warfare through propaganda leaflets continued over 50 years in the Korean Peninsula.
By analyzing the contents of the leaflets distributed during the Korean War, the study found that the Chinese and North Korean leaflets preferred the imperialist frame to the Cold War frame even though the U.S. and South Korean leaflets more heavily used the Cold War frame. The finding reflects the fact that the Korean War was framed as a Cold War in the allies contexts, whereas it was framed as an anti-imperialist war in the Communists contexts.
The main frames of leaflets differed depending upon the target audiences and the language used. Although encouraging surrender (21.9%) and demoralization (23.1%) were the most frequent themes of the leaflets during the overall war period, leaflets targeting foreign troops (Chinese and U.S. soldiers) used more extensively these two themes, rising to 25.7% and 35.6%, respectively. In particular, emphasizing the puppet role frame, which was ranked in the fourth place (12.0%) among the total samples, was not found in English language leaflets, which targeted U.S. soldiers.
The research also found that the allies used more pictorial messages (48.9%) than the Communists did (35.7%). But, communists were more dependent on gray propaganda content than allies."

I endeavor to join these bodies in a coherent whole and to consider the media effects, and social implications, of the resultant chain of ideology diffusion. Using data from the 2000 American National Election Studies, OLS regression, and bootstrapping analysis, I focus on the impact of cultivation on the political self-efficacy of those outside socially dominant groups. Particular attention is given to the cultivation of support for political and economic institutions. Results provide evidence of ideological cultivation in the political arena, and suggest a differential impact of the same on the political self-efficacy of African-Americans, but not women as a distinct category. Implications are discussed."

Most universities have research misconduct (RM) policies, which affect numerous actors in the institution. The complainant and the respondent are particularly vulnerable during RM proceedings. This research analyzes RM policies of 100 NSF-funded institutions to determine the extent to which the policies provide protections for respondents and complainants."
2009-1194,"Protecting Place From Politics: The ""Re-Placement"" of George W. Bush in Texas Monthly Magazine",Experiencing Place in and Through Popular Communication,,,,Paper,"Protecting Place From Politics: The ""Re-Placement"" of George W. Bush in Texas Monthly Magazine",Experiencing Place in and Through Popular Communication,"Journalism carries much cultural information about the places that are covered. Some magazines focus on specific places, and must balance the audiences sense of loyalty to and pride in that place with their coverage of sometimes harsh political realities. Texas Monthly presents a compelling case study of this challenge in its coverage of George W. Bush. In order to preserve its readers sense of pride in Texan identity, Bush is first strongly identified as Texan, and then is re-placed into a different geographic identity as his political career declines. This textual analysis examines nearly 100 articles from the magazine to demonstrate how a for-profit, place-based publication tries to inform its audience about politics while also pleasing them with regard to a place. In doing so, this analysis draws attention to issues faced by a variety of journalism organizations in maintaining both profit and journalistic integrity."
2009-1195,Protecting the Technologically Precocious Child: Technologies of Moral Authority in the Media Decency Debate,Regulating and Mediating Children's Media Use,,,,Paper,Protecting the Technologically Precocious Child: Technologies of Moral Authority in the Media Decency Debate,Regulating and Mediating Children's Media Use,"Prior to personal media technologies such as radio, television, video, or the Internet, parents had much more control over what children read or watched. The arrival of each technological innovation threatened to make both its predecessors and parents obsolete. Or, as media theorists Cary Balzalgette and David Buckingham argue: The threat which has been posed by each successive technological development  most notably by television and video  has derived from the fact that they seem to offer less and less control for adults. This loss of control stems from two separate, but interrelated, forces: the shifting of technological agency from adults to children and the shifting of moral authority from parents to the media. Using the Parents Television Councils representation and employment of new media technologies as a case study, this paper explores how shifts in technological agency have impacted the current debate over media decency in the United States, and how the rhetoric of family values is deployed by decency crusaders in a way that highlights the moral authority of parents. It will situate todays debate in the context of past media decency crusades, consider the impact of this concern with moral authority on media policy, and document how new technologies are used, both pragmatically and rhetorically, to counter the increasing technological agency of children."
2009-1196,Proximity to Experts? Rethinking Operationalizations of Cognitive Outcomes Based on Dual-Source Measures,Political Cognition: How People Process Political Messages,,,,Paper,Proximity to Experts? Rethinking Operationalizations of Cognitive Outcomes Based on Dual-Source Measures,Political Cognition: How People Process Political Messages,"The authors tested a novel approach to the conceptualization and measurement of science knowledge, individual proximity to expert consensus (PEC). Through an analysis of previous operationalizations of knowledge in the fields of psychology, sociology of science, and political science, the authors identify an alternative approach to assessing science knowledge based on dual-source measures. The authors argue that this operationalization captures a broader understanding of social issues and offers a more reliable method for assessing knowledge in large-scale data collections. Using the subject of nanotechnology as an example, the results obtained through the use of this measure indicated that attention to online political and scientific information regarding the benefits of nanotechnology positively influenced respondents abilities to translate information into an understanding that was similar to those of scientific experts. Oppositely, attention to political and scientific television programming regarding the risks associated with nanotechnology predicted deviation from expert consensus."

The study was designed to assess the on the amount of airtime PSAs receive, the distribution of PSAs throughout the day, the extent to which PSAs are paid  and the sponsors for both donated and paid PSAs, the extent to which PSAs reflect local or national issues, the issues that PSAs address, and the degree to which PSAs use network celebrity spokespeople. A total of 1,426 PSAs in 2000 and 1,595 PSAs in 2005 were extensively analyzed. Among the major findings: Television channels allocate less than one percent of their airtime to PSAs; PSAs are not evenly distributed across the day, with a plurality aired between midnight and 6 AM; nonprofits and governmental agencies pay for a sizeable proportion of the PSAs that are aired; most PSAs had a national rather than local orientation; and, health issues received more coverage than any other topic. Overall, the study suggests that nonprofits will need to be entrepreneurial and creative in order to maximize the PSA opportunities available on television."

For these purposes we performed a survey among 354 Dutch adolescent gamers. We found that game addiction can be associated with all kinds of computer and videogames, but that it is most common among players of online games. Since theoretical evidence suggests that online social interaction is an important aspect of establishing and maintaining game addiction, we investigated the role of two psychosocial characteristics that influence a persons ability at social interaction: social competence and loneliness. We found that higher levels of game addiction were related to lower levels of social competence and higher levels of loneliness. Furthermore, lower social competence was related to higher loneliness. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the effect of adolescents social competence on susceptibility to game addiction was fully mediated by loneliness. This means that socially less competent adolescent players are more likely to be addicted to games because they are lonelier."

We apply the Gap Analysis Model of Zeithaml, Parasuraman and Berry (1990) to such public communication, and try to give insight into the central gap between citizens' perceived and expected service delivery when governments publicly communicate about potential policies. We do this by systematically analyzing four gaps dealing with the following questions: (a) Do Ministers assess citizens' expectations about government communication on proposed policies in an appropriate manner? (b) Are the correct specific standards available to answer to the citizens' expectations about communication about potential policies? and (c) Does communication about potential policies fulfill the assumed standards? (d) Does the external communication policy regarding communication about potential policies occur in an appropriate manner? We conclude with action guides for overcoming communication gaps between government and citizens."

The analysis of Israel's image and its marketing efforts can help us better understand how marketers manage nation branding and marketing effort during prolonged crises and under constant conflict. The paper is based on qualitative analysis of dozens of advertisements, public relations campaigns, press releases, academic and popular articles, news articles, interviews, websites of Israel's government departments, and Jewish organizations. The analysis shows that over the years the nation's marketers used three kinds of strategies: focusing on the source, on the message, and on the target audience."

For this purpose, a survey was conducted among 350 customers of Wegmans Food Markets, Inc. The proposed model illustrates tenable data-model fits. Key findings of this study include significant direct effects of relational satisfaction on positive word-of-mouth communication, strong direct effects of organization reputation on both communication behaviors, and strong effects of both communication behaviors on customers ongoing interaction with the organization. More importantly, results show that customers identification with the organization significantly mediates the influence of relational satisfaction on customers communication behaviors."

These lines of research have also unintentionally reinforced the importance of local communities, and the ways in which communication technologies help to establish a local sense of belonging. This paper extends communication infrastructure theory (Ball-Rokeach, Kim & Matei, 2001; Kim & Ball-Rokeach, 2006) to investigate the links between families domestic communication processes and public interactions in their local communities. Drawing on research conducted by the USC Metamorphosis Project over the last 10 years, in 11 diverse communities in Los Angeles, this paper highlights the crucial links between private and public constitutions of community belonging and civic engagement in new immigrant and ethnic minority urban communities. The consequences of public/private community engagement for new immigrants connections to community resources, including health care, social services, and education are detailed in light of the authors recent multi-method test of the theoretical framework presented in this work."
2009-1206,Public Relations and Understanding,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,,,,Paper,Public Relations and Understanding,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,"Subsequent to Habermas´s Theory of Communicative Action/TCA (Habermas, 1984, 1987) one can model public relations as a process of understanding. As an outcome of this attempt an approach for planning and evaluating public relations-communication was modeled, namely the concept of Consensus oriented public relations (COPR) (Burkart 2007, 2008).

My intention was to utilize some aspects of understanding in the Habermasian communication theory for public relations research. I could point out that especially in situations when conflicts are to be expected, public relations managers should take into account that their messages might be questioned by critical recipients (due to the idea of the so called validity claims that Habermas pointed out in his TCA): Members of the publics involved will offer their doubts about the truth of presented information, they will question the truthfulness of the involved communicators (firms, companies or parties) as well as the legitimacy of the communicators interests. In such cases the pr-communication process is disturbed and will be interrupted. Only if it is possible to eliminate such doubts, or, if doubts are prevented from the very beginning, the flow of communication will not be interrupted. In such situations it is necessary to initiate a meta-communication, similar to the Habermasian discourse otherwise conflicts will emerge or escalate. Therefore  and empirically based  I argued, public relations managers are well advised to take the basic principles of communication resp. understanding seriously. This point of view implies also that communications managers should think about good justifications of their positions resp. assertions in the forefront of potential conflicts  not till then they will be ready to negotiate a discourse-like situation."

To what extent, however, can stakeholder engagement actually make a long-term difference to stakeholder perceptions of organisational behaviour (image) and can that difference be measured? This paper takes a two-sided approach to these questions.

First, we report on our research into the extent and manner of changes in perceptions when members of the public are actively engaged in dialogue with scientists on issues of controversial science. Our results clearly showed that in focus groups people tended to feed each others negativity towards both controversial science and scientists but in dialogue with scientists, people were prepared to examine their own misgivings and also to regard the scientists more empathetically.

Second, we examine the resistance of a large and controversial science research company in New Zealand to engage in dialogue with its full range of stakeholders. In the light of the dialogue research carried out earlier, the findings of which were to have been applied to the science research organisation, we concluded that the organisation was likely to damage itself more by not engaging openly than by doing so. Thus we argue that stakeholder dialogue is very much a sustainability issue, that it cannot be limited to a narrow range of stakeholders, and that it is indeed an essential component of public relations, especially when the organisation concerned is already controversial. The relevance of conclusions from this research will be debated in relation to the current environment and conceptualizations of future practice of public relations."

From in-depth interviews with four pioneers of the industry in the country, this study found that public relations is an adopted, young, and growing profession in Guatemala. The emergence of the field has been driven by global trends shaped by local factors, and has rapidly risen both in demand and in status. However, public relations in Guatemala also faces great challenges mainly related to a strong necessity of local practitioners professionally trained and a more profound recognition of the influence of idiosyncratic characteristics of the country. Further lines of research and recommendations for public relations practice are also proposed."

New technologies are in the process of forming the central nervous system for our society in a manner unimaginable even in the media-drenched late twentieth century. No previous communications revolution has held the promise of allowing us to radically transcend the structural communications limitations for effective self-government and human happiness that have existed throughout human history. But such a revolution will not occur because of a magical technology; it will only occur because people have organized to make it happen.
This point is of acute importance to my fellow scholars across many disciplines. Because communications is interdisciplinary, vital contributions come from historians, economists, legal scholars, public policy scholars, education researchers, engineers, and social scientists from various disciplines. The field of media studies cannot undertake this alone, and all of these scholars need to begin the process of working with each other. In interdisciplinary work, the whole is vastly greater than the sum of the proverbial parts. That being said, my argument is aimed directly at those who work in communications or media studies, and at our students, both graduate and undergraduate, past, present, and future. This is one constituency that has only begun to consider the nature of the historical moment we are entering and whose very existence depends upon coming to terms with it. Media studies must provide the substance that creates the gravitational pull to draw scholars from other disciplines together. I believe that scholars have a crucial and indispensable role to play in the coming period and that the best possible outcome
for media policies depends upon their active involvement."

In my presentation I will lay out a brief argument about how homeless people, whatever their own interests and struggles, are made to communicate key messages about the nature, and the value, of urban public space. Through their presence, homeless people shape public space not only as a key concept in contemporary urbanism, but also as a key battleground over who has the right to the city."

The Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovak cases have something relatives, when we compare them at historical context and social point of view. Mentioned States were democratic organized after the communist collapse and all of them nowadays  the members of EU (at the same time). Maybe, there is a quite important reason to compare and analyse the Baltic States and the Members of Vysehrad Group together. The specific role of the media, especially because of its influential role on the social actions (for instance electoral ones) seems to be highly performed by new techniques and methods of information selling process. The elections (parliamentarian, presidential and Euro elections) were attracted as an interesting case, and not only because of the media commercialization process (post communist reforms), mostly the sharply contest between themselves during campaigning (public versus private media).
At least not last, one important, significant group are citizens, especially their economic condition, knowledge (i.e. about EU) as a whole influenced the media campaigning messages. The socio-demographic, cultural, economic, psychological, and political profile should give the impression on Central European voters and non-voters as well as the reasons of such behaviours with the political parties (candidates) and media campaigning involvement."

An intimate public is a porous, mediated space where tactics for survival are worked through and the optimism of the will revitalized, and where the political is usually a threat to the sense of continuity people cultivate; belonging to any public promises a vague atmosphere of continuity among strangers that confirms its members without demanding a lot of them."
2009-1214,Public Trust: Theoretical Foundations and a New Research Instrument,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,,,,Paper,Public Trust: Theoretical Foundations and a New Research Instrument,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,"In modern societies, which can be defined as information, communication or media societies, public trust is an important phenomenon and a decisive social mechanism. Political parties, governments, private companies, associations etc. can suffer seriously from losses of public trust and they are dependent of having high trust and reputation rates. Public trust can be defined on the one hand as a process and on the other hand as a result of publicly generated trust in publicly perceivable agents, organisations and social systems. Public trust is built (and lost) not only, but in a high degree through and by communicative processes of media reporting. Because of the fact, that people cannot observe directly the greatest part of events going on every day on the world, but they are informed about most events which take place or are staged (e.g., media events like a press conference) by the media, people are dependent of these informations, being manufactured by Public Relations and media journalists. In the same process people have to trust more or less the informations which they receive in this process. Credibility as a whole, as well as more or less credible texts and more or less rated individual agents are seen as a part of the continuously ongoing public trust building process.
In this presentation, a framework of a theory of public trust is developed and a content analytical instrument for measuring public trust is presented. Basic trust theories which are seen as beginning points for the theory of public trust are the trust theories of Niklas Luhmann, James S. Coleman and Anthony Giddens. Publicly perceived individuals (politicians, business people, sportsmen), organisations and social systems (e.g. the health system or the financial system) act as trust objects, people who trust those objects in a certain degree are defined as trust subjects. It can be said that trust subjects have future oriented expectations which are based on certain experiences in the past. Public Relations, Journalism and the media act as trust intermediates in this process, but they can be seen as well as trust objects from another analytical perspective."

The journalists report that deliberation represents a unique way for citizens to communicate with decision-makers, and the process itself is considered newsworthy. They further highlight the potential for deliberation to enhance citizen knowledge and efficacy while expressing less optimism about the potential for deliberation to have much impact on decision-makers. The journalists nevertheless argued that citizen engagement could play an important role in public discussion about complex issues. The manuscript describes what these results may mean for those interested in mediated deliberation and suggests several areas of future research."

Czech Journalists 20 Years After the Collapse of the Old Media System,Twenty Years of Free Media and the Public Sphere in Central Europe,"Paper examines the transformation of professional attitudes and professional ideology of Czech journalists in the new sociopolitical conditions. It analyzes basic attributes of their new professional self-image. This analysis tries to reflect the main socio-economic changes which took place after collapse of old media system too. Specifically, changes in relation to the functions of news media, the development of market conditions and media consumption patterns. Presented data indicate that transformation of the Czech media system in the 1990s has started two processes which have weakened the fragile professional status of Czech journalists. We called these processes deprofessionalization and proletarization. These two processes have shaped the professional self-image of Czech journalists. Majority Czech journalists still face a persistent dilema. While they have professional aspirations to offer society quality public service, they are confronted with a significantly accelerated process of commercialization in the entire media sector. Today Czech journalists are forced to balance these two requirements, to make a good compromise. As a result of transformation of professional journalistic ideology we can see that besides traditional approaches to the journalistic profession (the educational, advocate/adversarial and neutral/objective types of journalists), there has appeared a new sub-group which stresses a distinctive career/pragmatic approach to the role of journalist. These journalists perceive their work as a tool for individual development and individual career and strictly reject the traditional educating-cultivating role of journalists. The presented paper is based upon the three research projects which were undertaken between 2002-2007 and were focused on social and professional role of Czech journalists."

Many of the discrepancies can be traced to the variety of terms and definitions for telework, such as virtual work, mobile work, distributed work, and eWork. Therefore, who teleworks remains elusive, the motivations for teleworking are still unclear, and attempts at theory building and theory application are hampered by definitional problems. The number of people who say they work exclusively from home on a regular basis is actually quite small, making it difficult to find populations for study as well as making research that focuses exclusively on these individuals of questionable value. Rather than focusing on teleworkers as a population, it may be more fruitful for research to focus on how the nuances of different types of telework affect theoretical models. In addition, studying larger units of analysis such as teams and organizations that contain some teleworkers and some non-teleworkers more closely mirrors actual work scenarios and reveals additional research questions. As a starting point, this analysis explores the various definitions of telework, statistics for teleworkers in the United States, and proposes how teleworkers might be classified for in future research programs."

There is a lack of validated measures to assess cancer patients information and communication needs. The aim of this study is to develop a patient-centered instrument to measure needs and performance related to communication surrounding chemotherapy treatment: QUOTEchemo.
Methods
Data of 345 cancer patients from ten different hospitals who started chemotherapy treatment for the first time were used to evaluate the psychometric properties.
Results
Factor analysis confirmed that the instrument consisted of 67 items measuring seven communication dimensions (i.e. Treatment-related information, Prognosis information, Rehabilitation information, Coping information, Interpersonal communication, Tailored communication and Affective communication). Results showed that the QUOTEchemo captured relevant issues of concern with good internal consistency and satisfactory item-total correlations. The seven dimensions were associated with validated measures. The instrument also appeared to be able to detect aspects that need to be improved. The highest need for improvement was found for Prognosis information (e.g. expected survival and outcome without chemotherapy treatment), Rehabilitation information (e.g. preventing or reducing side effects at home) and Interpersonal communication (e.g. discussing how patient and significant others can cope with treatment together).
Conclusions
These findings suggest that the QUOTEchemo is reliable and valid for use in cancer care surrounding chemotherapy treatment. Researchers and health care providers can use the instrument to measure patients needs and experiences with communication surrounding chemotherapy treatment and to identify aspects that need improvement, with the ultimate aim of improving the quality of care for patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment."

Her construction as a white, frontier woman that captured the imagination of the American people highlights the inherent, subtle and simmering, racial tensions within the United States. Her ability to invoke racist responses, as support, among her constituents speaks to a complicated binary coding of female empowerment vs. racism and racist ideologies of the US that begs discussion."

The exposure varied Local and Haole (Caucasian) race group membership, in addition to Equal and High power status of the criticizer. Racial group membership of the criticizer was significantly related to recipient evaluations of a critical person, in that critical Haoles were evaluated less favorably than critical Locals. Racial group membership of the criticizer influenced evaluations of identification with Hawaii, in that critical Haoles were evaluated as having less identification than critical Locals. Power was significantly related to assertiveness levels among hypothetical communication responses. Race and power interacted to impact the level of communication responses people reported they would employ. Theoretical implications are discussed and a model of language criticism is proposed."

Using a multiple messages design, participants were exposed to a press release about a factitious rap artist including a biography, set of sample lyrics and a photo that served as a manipulation of artist race (Black, White, Hispanic or No Picture). Results indicate that contrary to existing themes in the extant literature, Rap music has not been so closely associated with African American stereotypes that it serves as a proxy when race is varied or absent. Evidence supports the notion that only when a Black artist is explicitly featured in the press release do racial stereotypes become salient and used for evaluations on a number of race related scales. Implications of these findings are discussed in a framework of Ethnic Blame Discourse and Associative Network Models of social cognition."

A Content Analysis of Televised Video Game Commercials",Game Studies: Impacts and Influences,"The current study represents one of the first quantitative content analyses of televised video game commercials. Data were collected from sixty-nine hours of programming recorded from two networks (MTV and G4), yielding a total of 332 video game commercials. The goal of the study was twofold: the first was to assess the distribution of a variety of demographic variables of the 'real-life' characters featured in the video game commercials; the second was to examine the type of violence and the number of violent acts that appeared in the commercials. Among the key findings, it was found that female characters receive near equal screen time to their male counterparts; however, the distribution of race observed in the commercials does not reflect the actual racial demographics of the video game players who are the target of these advertisements. With regard to violence, it was found that overall, commercials for video games rated ""M"" or ""AO"" featured more violent acts than games rated for teens and children. However, when the mode of violence was taken into account (i.e., whether the violence was implemented using weapons, magic, or hand-to-hand combat) it was found that commercials for videogames rated for children under 12 featured significantly more fantasy violence than games rated for older children and adults."

It is criticized, that the measure itself alters media experiences leading to non valid data. Because of the cognitive task required for evaluation, the experience might also become more cognitively reflected. This leads to the main research question: To what extent does the employment of RTR measurements alter media experience? Given that the use of RTR-equipment might lead to a more cognitive processing style, we proposed an attenuation of the experience. In the experimental design, two groups were tested with the same stimulus. For both groups physiological arousal (EDA) was measured as an indicator of intensity of processing and experiencing of the media content. The experimental group had to perform an RTR-rating task, whereas the control group could watch a TV-show undisturbed. Our leading assumption, that the RTR-task would trigger more cognitive activity and thus attenuate emotional experience didnt hold true as simple as we thought. We found an interesting processual development over time. During the first minutes of exposure, arousal was higher for the RTR-group. Along the viewing process, arousal then continually drops. Regarding the last minutes of viewing, we observed the situation we expected in the first place: arousal was much lower for the RTR- than for the non-RTR-group. These findings can be supported by the concepts of adaption processes while establishing or retrieving a suitable schema for the novel information."

Using a mixed experimental research design, the study presented a news situation, i.e., a photograph, in which a woman was on fire, in differing versions that demonstrated the three situations.
Results of ANOVA, based on the responses of 72 readers in a self-selection sample, clearly showed that readers adopted a situational ethics rationale. Results indicated that the presence of other helpers (H1a), the clear intention of the victim to sacrifice her life to make a political statement (H2a), and the low possibility of intervention by the photographer (H3a) each resulted in higher agreement of readers with the photographers decision to make a picture, compared with situations which did not have the presence of other helpers, an intention of the victim to sacrifice her life, or a high possibility of intervention by the photographer. Similarly, all three situations increased the readers likelihood of making a decision to take the picture (H1b, H2b, and H3b). In conclusion, the situational characteristics tested seem to provide a basis upon which readers and journalists alike may decide whether professional ethics can supersede the moral compulsion to help a fellow in distress."

Undergraduate students (N = 490) reported on their relationships with a close friend and a favorite mediated personality. In applying the investment model to both contexts, this study finds that despite differences in the strengths of associations, the model largely operated in similar ways to predict commitment. Specifically, in both contexts, greater relational investment and satisfaction predicted relational commitment, whereas, attractiveness of alternatives negatively predicted commitment only in friendships. Applying a media-focused model, the study finds that, in both contexts, relational closeness is predicted by identification with and commitment to the friend or character, as well as by the friends or characters integration within a larger social network. The findings extend past research regarding the application of interpersonal theories to the media context, and vice versa, and supports the importance of assessing relational commitment, investment, and network status in parasocial relationships."

Of these reality sitcoms, two iconic musicians, Joseph Reverend Simmons of Run-DMC and Gene Simmons from KISS, have used their respective cable shows as a pulpit to preach  often through humor  a return to paterfamilias and the importance of family love and loyalty, even for the most unconventional families.

Formats like Idol, Big Brother and Survivor travel easily across political and linguistic boundaries and have found enthusiastic audiences in every sort of media market. It is the argument of this paper that reality programmings quasi-universal scope derives from its formal structure. Based on a few simple rules, a reality show can be likened to program which runs in different cultural contexts to produce a variety of outputs. I compare two versions of the Idol format  American Idol and Indian Idol  to demonstrate how the logic of its syntax enables the channeling of various cultural identifications and affects through the mechanics of a talent contest. While the resulting products are widely divergent, the thin thread of commonality between the American and Indian Idols can serve as a model for the ties that bind us on a global scale."

Community formation and sustenance in the real/virtual realms is especially important to understand how fluid global/local identities combine to pave the way for such social change. Using the theory of interpretive communities, I analyze a network of queer Indian bloggers/readers/commenters and their reading of the mainstream-media coverage of Indias first national Gay Pride marches, to examine how they articulate their demands for social change and resist the meaning of queer generated by the mainstream-media coverage. Media ethnography and qualitative content analysis decipher the strategies used by the interpretive community to organize themselves and explore how the bloggers are at once consumers/audience of mainstream-media and producers of alternative-media. Resistance to mainstream-media sponsored gender-normativity is problematized, and the analysis reveals a simultaneous talking-back and legitimization of media-authority."
2009-1229,Rearticulating the Journalism Profession: Public Journalism and Professional Reflexivity,Journalists on Journalism,,,,Paper,Rearticulating the Journalism Profession: Public Journalism and Professional Reflexivity,Journalists on Journalism,"In this paper I will examine journalism profession from the viewpoint of journalists own perspective. I will examine the way in which public journalism projects in three different newspapers in Finland have acted as a ground for professional reflexivity. The idea of the paper is to consider how journalists position themselves as professionals when they can reflect upon their own self-image and work practices through concrete and experimental news projects.

Public journalism (or civic journalism) refers to the reform movement, to set of practices and to the philosophy about the press and its relation to the public. In this paper I will conclude that public journalism in the Finnish context has invoked journalists to reflect on their professional identities in relation to four directions: their own work community, the media organisation, the public (sphere) and the profession.

Journalists rearticulate the role of the journalist as a helper; accessible collaborator; discussion moderator or connector and as a commercial representative of the paper. These signs point to the direction that despite its permanence and stability, journalists professional self-image is a construct that can be rearticulated."

Despite its relevance, discussions of resource mobilization theory are absent in activist public relations research. The purpose of this paper is to (re)introduce resource mobilization theory into the theoretical spectrum of public relations research, and to attempt to integrate resource mobilization theory into our understanding of the role public relations plays in the development and viability of activist organizations.

The paper focuses on how resource mobilization theory categorizes publics of activists by whether or not publics will directly benefit from the achievement of a particular activist groups goals. Resource mobilization theory classifies publics along two dimensions: potential to benefit from the accomplishment of an activist groups goal; and the potential of a particular group to contribute resources. The paper argues that from an activist groups perspective, it is far more helpful to consider publics as potential beneficiaries than as issue-related, as this classificatory scheme aids in determining how and if a specific group can be mobilized. Segmenting groups into various kinds of beneficiaries helps to strategically determine what styles of resource mobilization should be adopted for each public.

The paper suggests that, lacking a theoretical framework of activist group structuralization of its own, public relations is in need of looking outside its boundaries for a cohesive framework in which to think about and examine activist groups as public relations practitioners in their own right. The paper details how the resource mobilization perspective views an activist organizations publics and the variety of relationships that must be built, maintained and repaired with publics. To conclude, the paper will attempt to illustrate the relevance of integrating resource mobilization theory into public relations understanding of activist groups and for reconceptualizing how activist organizations interact with their publics."

The paper theorizes trust as a product of staff belief in integrity, competence, and dependability of organization (Hon & Grunig, 1999) and provides an explanatory framework to re-conceptualize trust in health care settings from an objectivist orientation as a macro level variable through locating trust in: (a) a theoretical calculus-based relational model; and, (b) its emergence from conditions of vulnerability, interdependence, and risk. Second, as trust is fundamentally dependent on context from which it emerges, the study proposes a definition of organizational trust in health care organizations specifically incorporating context of safety climate (Reason, 1997) with main dimensions of integrity, competence, and dependability (Hon & Grunig, 1999). Third, in order to enhance understanding of the role of structural, relational, and contextual variables during organizational change, study provides preliminary empirical evidence supporting hypotheses based on proposed conceptualization and finds in accordance with theory of planned behavior trust has a small but significant effect on staff attitudes and perception of subjective norms regarding change practices as well as acts a significant moderator in relationship between structural variables and contextual variables like safety climate."

Models by L. J. Shrum (2001) and M. A. Shapiro and A. Lang (1991) provide insight about psychological processes underlying these effects. We conducted two studies in an attempt to replicate and extend data. This study undertakes a fourth attempt to replicate Shrums (2001) heuristic processing model of cultivation effects. Following a failed replication, an exact replication was attempted with measures of political affiliation at the end. Data suggest that the conservative bias of our sample may have led to the failed replication. A third replication suggested this may be the case; however, those data also skewed very conservative, and we once again failed to replicate Shrum (2001) despite exhibiting a strong mainstreaming effect. Thus we are undertaking a fourth attempt using a national phone experiment in order to draw a balance across political affiliations."

The authors examined seven U.S. newspapers and two news magazines to determine how Obamas candidacy precipitated discussions about race in American society. Among the subjects examined were: explicit discussions of racism and racial inequality; mentions of Obamas racial biography; and Obamas connections to the black community. Findings suggest that the presss dependence upon the dominant horse-race frame encouraged individualist approaches to race, and depicted American voters as members of antagonistic racial groups. The horserace frame also reduced racial issues to whether or not candidates alienated specific groups when racially-charged remarks were made, and did not prompt discussions of how their policies might affect race relations or remedy racial inequalities."

Supporting portions of ICT succession theory (Stephens, 2007) and mere exposure effect (Zajonc, 1968), these two types of redundancy affected outcomes in different and combined ways. The interaction between message redundancy and complementary ICT sequences (e.g., face-to-face followed by email or email followed-by face-to-face) was significant for the measures of behavioral intentions and perceptions of information effectiveness. There was a main effect of ICT sequence on communication overload. The findings also suggest that presenting the exact same message using complementary ICTs fostered more positive knowledge outcomes than other message and ICT redundancy conditions."

The longitudinal nature of the analysis permits investigation of how key concepts in health risk communication change over time in relation to each other and how communication strategies might be developed to deal with those changes. Data show that intensive communication campaigns since the first outbreak of avian flu in Egypt have contributed to strong public response and an increase in protective behaviors, but that they may also result over time in a downward reassessment of susceptibility that will require future programs to maintain a dialogue with their audiences as risk assessment fluctuates with knowledge and experience."

The diffusion of participatory media technologies has amplified a global dimension of political deliberations and citizen participation in Turkey. Blogs have been increasingly used by political actors/citizens for providing/acquiring information and interacting with each other. The number of political actors/citizens has progressively grown: today almost every political organization and candidate maintains an active online presence. Previous studies have examined political blogs as performing three major functions: blogs as political journals, blogs as organizing tools, and blogs as civic participatory instruments. In fact, consensus has yet to be reached on an all-encompassing theoretical framework for analyzing these functions. This study employed a synthesizing approach to investigate the discussion of the U.S. presidential election in the Turkish blogosphere by identifying major themes and patterns of interactive discourse and exploring the perceived effects on the Turkish public opinion."

The presentation also seeks to identify ways in which social justice objectives can be identified, developed, and realized in process. Can the approach to interviewing informed by Dervins Sense-Making Methodology contribute?"
2009-1239,Regulating the Privacy of Confidentiality: Grasping the Complexities Through Communication Privacy Management Theory,Theoretical Advances in Disclosure and Avoidance Decisions,,,,Paper,Regulating the Privacy of Confidentiality: Grasping the Complexities Through Communication Privacy Management Theory,Theoretical Advances in Disclosure and Avoidance Decisions,"In our current world, we often face the concomitant needs of maintaining privacy and revealing to others to attain medical care, establish friendships, sustain family relationships, open bank accounts, get a passport, and talk to our clergy. In all cases, to achieve these goals, we have to tell others our private information. When we make these disclosures, we create a bond with the recipient. There is an implicit or explicit contract that we establish with the confidant. We think about the targets of our disclosure as people who are likely to keep our information confidential. Yet, there are many incidents where the contract of confidentiality is breached in ways that violate our trust, undercut our privacy, and compromise our expectations about the nature of confidentiality. While we see these issues in our everyday life, the instability of faith in maintaining privacy has both personal and societal consequences. As Kenneth Prewitt, former director of the U.S. Census Bureau points out, it is difficult to have the kind of democracy we enjoy in the U. S. without access to information. He notes, if privacy issues [and the belief in confidentiality] begin to erode the information base of our democracy, there is a high price to pay (Prewitt, 2005, p. 17). This manuscript uses Communication Privacy Management theory (Petronio, 2002) to explore the relationship between privacy and confidentiality to better understand the reasons why people are increasingly finding it difficult to have faith in the notion of confidentiality."

This study complements previous investigation of regulatory focus theory and message framing and validates the propositions that a regulatory fit between frame valence and self-regulatory focus led to a stronger behavioral intention than a misfit between frame valence and self-regulatory focus."

While both theories imply prescriptions to frame behavior change messages in terms of the motivations which are active when recommended behaviors are to be performed, they have not adequately addressed the potentially problematic situation where prescribed behaviors are believed to conflict with these motivations or when the behaviors are not already strongly associated with the attainment of positive outcomes or avoidance of negative ones. Mixed results were found for two contextually related behaviors which differ in terms of these factors with only one of the behaviors producing results supportive of these theories."

In other words, they suggested thatputting aside some key questions of media influencethe way journalists select and publish news items is not so different from the way the rest of us perceive and discuss the world. The mental processes that unfolded in the press as gatekeeping were, in some sense, just manifestations of our universal human condition. But Galtung and Ruges work, while widely cited, was quickly divorced of these theoretical underpinnings in the psychology of perception. By 1982, scholars like Hartley were citing Galtung and Ruge and in the same breath suggesting that their news values are neither natural nor neutral. They form a code which sees the world in a very particular (even peculiar) way (p. 80). In this literature review, I argue that, in treating journalism as a particular and peculiar form of communication, journalism scholars have at times lost sight of the commonalities between journalism and other forms of communication. Such omissions have left us ill-equipped to deal with forms of new media that share some of journalisms qualities. In order to rectify this situation, and truly appreciate the manner in which journalism fits into the new media landscape, I suggest it will be necessary to reclaim the broader theoretical underpinnings of the news values literaturethose stemming from psychology as well as other fieldsand jettison much of what the atheoretical literature on news values has become."
2009-1243,(Re)Imagining Possibilities for Peace,Organizational Communication and Globalization Processes,,,,Paper,(Re)Imagining Possibilities for Peace,Organizational Communication and Globalization Processes,"This analysis focuses on the efforts of an international nongovernmental organization (NGO), based in Sweden. Kvinna till Kvinna (Woman to Woman), partners with local womens organizations in post-conflict societies to carry out peace work. Drawing upon postcolonial feminisms and narrative theories, we show how Kvinna till Kvinna and partners create spaces for alternative rationalities and imagination to thrive. Through these organizing practices, women who have been marginalized before, during, and after conflict, are given opportunity to re-member culture on their own terms, reclaim spaces for political action, and reconfigure the meanings of sustainability by focusing on long-term networking and relationships. Kvinna till Kvinna provides scholars and practitioners with an organizational context that is useful in exploring the struggles and opportunities of international organizing that is driven by feminist ideals and goals for peace and reconstruction."

Yet research that examines effects of such selective exposure is scarce. The current two session- experiment (n = 157) tackles this issue in the political context. The first session consisted of a computerized questionnaire about 12 political issue attitudes, political self-concept, and other variables. Accessibility data were collected based on response times. In the second session, participants browsed through an online magazine. Four issues chosen from the 12 issues were covered, with two articles featuring opposing perspectives. Selective reading was unobtrusively logged. Finally, a questionnaire repeated measures for attitudes and self-concept. Results show that media users prefer attitude-consistent over counter-attitudinal messages and that this preference strengthens the political self-concept through increased accessibility."

At the same time, it would be a mistake to suggest that there is a single, coherent program or approach to media education in Canada. In this paper, we examine the difficulties this eclecticism has created and also note major institutional and ideological divisions which have undermined attempts to develop a coherent strategy for media education in Canada. In response to this situation, we examine how successful attempts to develop critical youth media production practices in informal, community-based learning environments offer important lessons that can inform how media literacy is developed in formal, school-based learning environments across the country. Given the long history of media literacy in Canada, we contend that this study of national practices and concerns can provide an important lens from which to envision the development of future media education initiatives in jurisdictions around the world."

The old PBS provided a bridge between the commercial network era of broadcasting and the triumphant declaration of choice, freedom, and empowerment surrounding both the post-network telescape and the concomitant transition to a post-welfare society. This legacy is the starting point for evaluating PBSs recent efforts to reinvent itself as a business, a brand, and a resource for a new epoch of mass customization and personal responsibility."
2009-1247,Relational Dialectics Theory: Reclaiming Uncertainty Through the Formation of New Meanings,Uncertainty and Information Management: Reflections on the Current and Future State of These Constructs (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Relational Dialectics Theory: Reclaiming Uncertainty Through the Formation of New Meanings,Uncertainty and Information Management: Reflections on the Current and Future State of These Constructs (Cross Unit),"The purpose of this manuscript is to reclaim uncertainty along different conceptual lines from the traditional approach evidenced by many of the chapters in this volume. In particular, we reconceptualize (un)certainty away from an individuals ability to predict and explain outcomes, viewing it instead as a characteristic of discourse; more specifically, uncertainty is framed as the interplay of different, often competing, discourses. This reconceptualization is grounded in Relational Dialectics Theory (RDT), which extends the dialogism work of the Russian cultural and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin to communication in familial, personal, and social relationships. In contrast to the traditional conceptualization in which communication is positioned as a strategy by which to reduce or manage uncertainty, a dialogic reconceptualization argues that uncertainty is an inherent feature of communication and the key process through which meaning is created. Thus, uncertainty is framed positively, not negatively, in a RDT reconceptualization. Totalizing certainty is to be guarded against, for it holds potential for calcification of meaning and thus potentially can extinguish creativeness by relationship parties. The manuscript opens with a discussion of the traditional conceptualization of (un)certainty and then articulates in the second section a dialogically-grounded reconceptualization. The third section examines implications of this reconceptualization for researchers of communication and relationships."
2009-1248,Relationship Maintenance After a Residential Move: The Difference Gender Makes,Relational Maintenance in the Face of Challenging Circumstances,,,,Paper,Relationship Maintenance After a Residential Move: The Difference Gender Makes,Relational Maintenance in the Face of Challenging Circumstances,"Residential mobility represents a natural experiment, because it puts people in a situation where some of their previous face-to-face interactions must stop or decline, leaving mediated communication, such as phone or email as a way to retain contact. Recent movers, who relocate to unfamiliar locations, also face the challenge of meeting new people and building new friendships. Research on gender differences in relational maintenance suggests that men and women may differ in how they communicate and what strategies they employ to maintain friendships. Similarly, research in computer mediated communication indicates that men and women differ in how and why they use communication technologies such as the Internet. This paper explores the role of communication technology use in maintenance of established relationships after a residential move with a specific focus on gender differences in relational maintenance. We report substantial gender differences in the role communication plays in relational maintenance."
2009-1249,Relationships Between Supervisory Communication and Commitment to Workgroup: A Multilevel Analysis Approach,Current Research on Organizational Groups and Teams,,,,Paper,Relationships Between Supervisory Communication and Commitment to Workgroup: A Multilevel Analysis Approach,Current Research on Organizational Groups and Teams,"The aim of the present study is to establish and interpret the appropriate level of analysis for the correlation between supervisory communication and commitment to workgroup. We intend to examine whether specific forms of correlations between supervisory communication and commitment to workgroup could be distinguished from each other at the individual or higher level of analysis. We present results from an individual, dyad and group sample taken from a Malaysian organization. We relate the measures of supervisory communication and commitment to workgroup from individuals embedded in a specific workgroup and to reflect individual communication with their immediate supervisor as possible antecedents for commitment to workgroup. To examine the relationship, we follow Within and Between Analysis (WABA) statistical procedures proposed by Danserau, Alutto, and Yammarino (1984). This procedure involves: (a) testing the total deviation scores for each variable presented within cell, or between cell scores known as WABA I; (b) testing on the level of analysis that may underlie relationships among all variables taken two at a time, known as WABA II, and (c) testing the total correlation and component analysis through the combination of WABA I and WABA II. We found the relationships between supervisory communication and commitment to workgroup is relevant for the whole group. The correlations between these two variables are interpreted as group differences where the individuals in a group are viewed as homogenized, and each workgroup is assigned one score on each variable. Implications of these findings are discussed."
2009-1250,Relations of Ruling: Using Dorothy E. Smiths Concept for Public Relations Theorizing,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,,,,Paper,Relations of Ruling: Using Dorothy E. Smiths Concept for Public Relations Theorizing,Towards a Theory of Public Relations Using Keywords From Sociology,"As other scholars have noted, public relations theorizing has predominantly been concerned with developing theory for public relations rather than of public relations. For example, public relations theorists typically have assumed the standpoint of organizational management, asking how effective public relations efforts are or could be in gaining public support for management objectives rather than asking how the public is affected by public relations and managerial discourses.
Ideas borrowed from Canadian sociologist Dorothy E. Smith could help public relations scholars conceptualize this alternative standpoint that illuminates a theory of public relations. Smith incorporates concepts from different theoretical positionsfeminism, Marxism, poststructuralism, even postcolonialism--to problematize features of the social world, making her an important example of how feminist social theory can be used to develop a critical public relations theory with the goal of benefiting women and ultimately, all people.
One particularly useful concept that Smith recontextualized from Marxian thought is that of relations of ruling. As a sociologist and a feminist, Smith has elaborated repeatedly on power relations in both social life and mainstream sociology. According to Smith (1987), existing social structures are based on the relations of ruling, a complex of practices and discourses providing direction and regulation (p. 3). Relations of ruling are objectified, impersonal, claiming universality (p. 4), and display a specific interrelation between patriarchal forms of our contemporary experience and the distinctive forms of organizing and ruling contemporary capitalist society (p. 3).
For Smith, women and other oppressed people do not have a place in the social system built from relations of ruling emerging from capitalism and from patriarchy. In patriarchal capitalism, women are forbidden to contribute to the language and culture of men, yet are asked to learn these, and women are not allowed in the work sphere of men, that of administration and ideas, yet they are asked to support this by means of housekeeping and secretarial chores (Smith, 1987, pp. 18-21; Smith, 2004, pp. 73-95). As Smith affirms (1987, 1990, 2004, 2005), traditional sociology, male and capitalist, white and Western, strengthens instead of changing these power relations."

This paper examines the implications of this particular incendiary, yet somewhat mundane, event for Canadian collective memory. A critical examination of the dominant popular discourses concerning Canadian collective memory that (re)emerged in the media following this event show that the effects of this event can only be clearly understood through an examination of place and space at the National War Memorial. The negotiation that took place between these discourses led to the alteration of this particular lieu des mémoires, which in turn affects the practices of memory that occur there. More generally, this shows that collective memory is perhaps better studied as a set of practices and relations rather than as a thing."
2009-1252,Religious Issues in News and Their Effect on Public Attitudes Towards the EU,Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Religious Issues in News and Their Effect on Public Attitudes Towards the EU,Political Communication Poster Session,"This article investigates whether the presence or absence of references to religious issues in EU news coverage primes peoples religious attitudes to contribute to their evaluation of the EU and European integration. For this purpose, a content analysis of the amount of religious news items in the EU coverage in German and Dutch newspaper between 1997 and 2007 was conducted (Germany n=10628, Netherlands n=6036). Two time points were chosen  1998, when only a small amount of religious news items in EU coverage was to be seen, and 2005, when a peak of religious references was ascertained in the EU coverage. Eurobarometer data (1998: G n=718, NL n=367; 2005: G n=1259, NL n= 943) was used to test the assumptions. The findings suggest that an increasing religious dimension in media coverage about the EU triggers the linkage between religious and political considerations and thus influences attitudes towards the EU. The findings shed new light on media priming and research on public attitudes towards European integration."

Rather than focus on gaming groups and gaming fans, this study situates the analysis of video game play with the individual, solitary player. There were three main goals in this project. The first was to see how video game play fit within the lives and media diets of those who do not identify as hardcore video game fans. The second was to find the differences and similarities between the hardcore/causal and social/solitary gaming divides. The final goal was to interrogate the interrelated issues of identity and identification in video game play. While a small scale pilot study, the methodology discussed herein should be useful in future research on video game audiences and identification."

Due to this physical absence, a web memorial often precedes the arrival of the soldiers bodies to their graveyard in an intriguing challenge to conventional notions of space and time. In this research I explore the intersections of race, ethnicity, colonialism and imperialism in these spaces. I am focusing on two different trends in web memorials dedicated to the fallen Puerto Rican soldiers: those spontaneous/unintended; and corporate sponsored web memorials. My specific research inquiry concerns how these web memorials, dedicated to Puerto Rican soldiers fallen during the war (or incidents related to it), articulate the identities of these soldiers in ways that reproduce their racial-colonial subjectivity."

First, digital capabilities have led to the emergence of new distribution platforms. Second, within those platforms we have seen a rapid increase in the number of available content offerings. Finally, as a result of the first two trends, individuals increasingly spread their attention across a wide range of media, both within and across platforms. A common mechanism for coping with an abundance of content and finite attention is a reliance on repertoires of media offerings. This study presents an empirical analysis of cross-platform media repertoires using duplication data from the single-source, electronically measured TV/Internet Convergence Panel, administered by Nielsen Media Research. Using the network analysis tool UCINET, media offerings are grouped based on structural equivalence (i.e., a measure of the similarity in linkage patterns among nodes in a network). Following that, discriminant function analysis tests the ability of an integrated model, accounting for structural and individual determinants of audience behavior, to predict membership in the various repertoires."

The present study continued this line of work in the United States and Bulgaria. The latter context is not only intriguing as little communication research has been conducted there, but is significant in being heralded as having one of the most corrupt governments and law enforcement institutions in the European Community. Besides differences between nations, results revealed that for U.S.A. participants, officer accommodativeness indirectly predicted civilian compliance through trust. For those in Bulgaria, however, only direct relationships were foundbetween officer accommodation and civilian trust, and between accommodation and compliance. The latter finding is fairly unique and the theoretical and practical significance of these are discussed."

A discourse analysis of the extensive press coverage of the series and related newsworthy events reveals a complex array of issues with two dominant themes emerging. First, the series has been referred to as evidence and proof of the problem of predators trolling the Internet. Discussion of the series has contributed substantially to a broad discourse of fear regarding the safety of children and subsequent calls for legislation to enhance law enforcement powers and increase penalties against sex offenders. And second, the series has become an important locus for self-reflexive discussions within the press regarding normative journalism. Some of the criticisms levied against Datelines journalistic practices can be understood as a form of news repair that aims to strengthen and legitimize the standards of the profession."

Columns of three well-known columnists in the leading U.S. weekly news magazines were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to detect emergent themes in their coverage of and commentary on the campaign. The three columnists all used four different frames in writing about the campaign: a traditional journalistic frame of reporting; a moral compass frame; a perspective of what voters want; and a third-person theme, which demonstrates the effects of the theory by the same name. All four themes are analyzed and illustrated with examples from the text."

Previous studies concerning representations and stereotyping of Mexicans in cinema have been conducted before MNC emerged. They form part of general histories of Mexican cinema written by both Mexican and foreign film historians, critics, and scholars concerned with the evolution of Mexican film genres and the representations of Mexicans from the 1890s to the 1980s. Drawing from semiotics, this analysis will identify the distinguishing traits and stereotypes of Mexican identity construction in Mexican New Cinema from 2000 to 2008. The purposive sample will include the semiotic analysis of nine films to explore representations of Mexican identities."

These engines include, among others, the four basic tropes (i.e. metaphor, metonym, synecdoche and irony as explicated by Kenneth Burke and Hayden White), systems of binary oppositions in such domains of discourse as motives (e.g. good/evil, rational/irrational) and institutions (e.g. freedom/enslavement, law/power), as well as basic cognitive schemas (e.g. agent/action, tribulation/triumph). Substantive examples are drawn from a variety of attempts to portray warfare as found in print and broadcast journalism, documentaries and blogs. These examples range from the frames for little stories about individual soldiers to the meta-frames that not only shape public understanding international conflict but animate those conflicts in the first place. Such meta-frames include the domino theory of Asian communism in the era of the US-Vietnam War to the contemporary 'war on terror' and democratization of the Middle East."

Only recently has there been the steady inclusion of Latina/os and other ambiguous ethnics who fall somewhere in between the two binary poles of racial representation. This is also the case in children's television world wide. The introduction and rise of Disney Channel in children's television programming means that many of their shows circulate globally and contribute to the representation of diverse children across the globe. However the global circulation is based on national paradigms and politics. Once these shows are globally distributed, that sharp attention necessary to discern Latinidad might be altogether to ask of global audiences who are not likely to possess the knowledge to interpret the ethnicity of these girls. Further research is necessary to explore whether global audiences can even tell that these light brown are ethnic at all."

From personal history questionnaires to panel studies, surveys, and focused interviews, researchers interested in communication have asked questions in person, and codified their methods in print. As a consequence, the interview is a rich object for unpacking the social and intellectual history of the field. I make a brief general case for the place of the history of methodology in the emerging subfield of communication history, then cash out my claim by outlining the history of the focused interviewone of the few general social scientific methods forged within the contexts of communication study. Beginning with its codification in the early 1940s, when the focused interview was conceptualized against the backdrop of psychoanalysis and practiced by women talking with other women, I will trace the repressed origins of a method that has schizophrenically served as an agency for therapeutic expression and democratic conversation on the one hand, an aid to centralized propaganda and elite control on the other."

Comparing the development of early radio with the current broadband debate in the US, the paper explores the ways in which these spaces are conceived, lived, and perceived. The paper demonstrates that because technologies are inherently political, the point at which change can be effected in the system is at the technical rather than the political level. The paper examines the concept of a critical juncture in the context of Lefebvres spatial triad, making the argument that the politics inherent in technology should be taken into account when considering the point at which technological regulatory structures are mutable."
2009-1265,"Research Ethics: Trust, Truth, and Reuse in Databanks","Keyword ""Truth"": Philosophy, Communication, and Technology",,,,Paper,"Research Ethics: Trust, Truth, and Reuse in Databanks","Keyword ""Truth"": Philosophy, Communication, and Technology","The issue of trust and truth in research is confounded greatly in the use of databanks and data repositories. As more funding bodies and institutions require, or highly encourage, some form of ""data deposit"" from researchers, including such products as field notes, code books, instruments, and results, how informed consent applies must be considered. Consent typically covers strict parameters of participation whereby a research subject usually understands how the data will be used. Once a reuse database or databank removes the original context, questions of trust, truth, risk, intentionality, and ownership immediately rise. Communication scholars will indeed now need to consider the implications of the banking of such artifacts as video, audio, and text, as each media raises unique ethical quandaries. The relationship among researchers, researched, ethics boards, and funders in light of data repositories promises to be fascinating, and should be the subject of research consideration."

This paper focuses on four issues which have implications for the panel discussion on trends in public relations which link to international research practice and experience to present and resolve methodological challenges. The four issues are terminology debates; categorization of companies; role of political context/infrastructure; and media landscapes. The discussions utilize research experience in China that are illustrative and revealing about the shifting dynamics in that country. They call our attention to the importance of the concept of equivalence in data collection, analysis and interpretation, as we pursue comparisons across national contexts.
The first issue is the use of the term propaganda (xuan chuan) in the Chinese context. For historical reasons, propaganda as defined in China doesnt have the kind of negative connotation as it does in other countries, such as the U.S. Although the term is no longer as ubiquitous as it used to be in the Chinese public discourse, many companies still opt to use the word for the public relations function.
Second, the categorization of Chinese companies is different from that in the U.S. or Europe, for instance. There are three main organizational types among Chinese (domestic) companies: state-owned enterprises (SOEs), private companies and collectively-owned enterprises. Among them, there are publicly listed companies and privately held ones. The nature of these organizational types has varying implications for management processes, and may well also shape differing public relations practices.
The third issue the paper will discuss is the role of the Communist Party in Chinese companies. For some companies, public relations is under the supervision of the party secretary. The influence of the party in the day-to-day business process has certainly declined over the years. Nonetheless, the legacy of the party system is still felt in a variety of ways.
Finally, and through the findings of the research project the paper outlines some of the observations concerning the changing Chinese media environment and its implications for media relations practices in China. Nowadays, Chinese media outlets face market pressure to compete for readership and viewership which is similar to media in Western economies. They enjoy relative autonomy in selecting and presenting news and views. In the meantime, they are also constrained by the governments priorities and censorship. Moreover, the cultural phenomenon of guanxi is manifested in media relations practices."

The use of Dervins Sense-Making Methodology allows interviewees to speak and make connections in terms of their own lives rather than attempting to respond to questions framed from the perspective of the organization."

This study tries to move beyond an individual approach to the process of managing work/life relationships by paying attention to two discursive resourcesdelivery and wellbeingthat Swedish members of a multinational organization appropriate as they make sense of work as a part of everyday life. I consider two interpretations of the relationship between them: the company view and the cultural view, focusing on the tension between these two interpretations and its implications. I argue that in enacting both the company and cultural views members maintain a dynamic tension between lifeworld and system world interests. I argue that retaining, rather than resolving, this tension is necessary for emancipation and leads to a more harmonious experience of paid work as a part of everyday life."

A 2 (mortality vs. non-mortality) x 2 (in-group criminals vs. out-group criminals) between-subjects experiment is designed in this study. The study aims to examine the social influences of immigrant threats in TV news coverage on viewers and look at whether the news portrayals of immigrant threats can influence news viewers connection to mortality thoughts, their hostility toward immigrant criminals, their vulnerability to risk, and their judgments of the immigration issue. More importantly, the study may offer insight into the severe problem of immigrant threats that is perceived by most Americans and influences their perspectives on the immigration issue."

But, the factors influencing media agendas still remain relatively under-researched areas. This research investigate the relationship between the real-world conditions and media agendas in terms of Downs issue attention cycle with a research question of whether the media agendas are differently associated with crisis issues, symbolic crisis issues, problem issues, and non-problem issues.

With longitudinal comparisons in last 26 years (1981-2006), the present study found that a real world indicator (gasoline prices) of a crisis issue have a positive association with the number of articles in The New York Times and those of news on the TV networks with a 0.01 significance level. Similarly, there were strong and statistical significant associations between the real world indicator (interest rates) of a problem issue and news coverage. However, in terms of pollution (symbolic crisis) as well as crime (non-problem issue), the correlations between the real world index and news coverage failed to have statistically significant association.

To sum, the fluctuations of real world indicators of a problematic issue and a crisis issue well explained the increase and decrease in news coverage of the related issues. By contrast, the non-problem issues, as well as symbolic crisis issues, are regarded as media-driven issues, which depend on more journalistic judgments than the real world indicators. The next study should consider expanding research periods, using more refined the real world indicators, and considering the public agendas."
2009-1271,Rethinking the Media Ownership Policy Agenda,"""...And Communications for All:"" A Policy Agenda for the New Administration",,,,Paper,Rethinking the Media Ownership Policy Agenda,"""...And Communications for All:"" A Policy Agenda for the New Administration","Media ownership is a policy issue with a long and contentious history in the United States. It has become more contentious since Congress required, in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revisit its media ownership regulations every two years (later modified to every four years) and repeal or modify any rules determined to no longer be in the public interest. This has meant that the issue of media ownership is almost always near the top of the U.S. communications policy agenda, since by the time one review of the ownership regulations ends, a process that typically drags on because of the inevitable court challenges, the next one is scheduled to begin. The state of our media system is constantly changing, and. as a result, media ownership regulations are constantly up for reassessment (every four
years, as mandated by Congress). The recommendations outlined in this presentation will, therefore, focus less on the question of what our media ownership regulations should look like today and more on the broader (and ultimately more important) question of how our media ownership regulations should be assessed,not only today, but also in future iterations of the FCCs media ownership proceedings. This presentation presents seven guiding principles for contemporary
media ownership policymaking."
2009-1272,Rethinking the Remix: Audio Mash-Ups and the Metaphysics of Recording,Philosophy of Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Rethinking the Remix: Audio Mash-Ups and the Metaphysics of Recording,Philosophy of Communication Poster Session,"Critical evaluations of audio mash-ups and remixes tend to congregate around two poles. On the one hand, these often clever recombinations of recorded music are celebrated as innovative and creative interventions in the material of bland commodity culture. On the other hand, they are often reviled as derivative, inauthentic, and illegal because they do nothing more than appropriate and reconfigure the intellectual property of others. This essay does not side with either position but identifies and critiques the common understanding and fundamental assumptions that make these two, opposed positions possible in the first place. The consideration of this matter is divided into two main parts. The first considers the traditional understanding of technologically enabled reproduction and the often unquestioned value it invests in the concept of originality. It does so by beginning with a somewhat unlikely source, Plato's Phaedrusa dialogue that, it is argued, originally articulates the original concept of originality that both determines and is reproduced in the theories and practices of sound recording. The second part of the essay demonstrates how the audio mash-up deliberately intervenes in this tradition, advancing a fundamental challenge to the original understanding and privilege of originality. In making this argument, however, the essay does not endeavor to position the mash-up as anything unique or innovative. Instead, it demonstrates how mash-ups, true to their thoroughly derivative nature, plunder, reuse, and remix anomalies that are already available in and constitutive of recorded music."
2009-1273,Retroactive Futurity in the Media City of Shanghai,The New Media City,,,,Paper,Retroactive Futurity in the Media City of Shanghai,The New Media City,"In 1921 EMI constructed a recording studio for jazz in a mansion in the French Concession in Shanghai. The building was later taken over by Pathé and during Shanghais heyday of modernization, massculture, decadence, and cosmopolitanism in the 1920s and 30s, mandarin jazz tunes were recorded here. After 1949 the recordings continued, for example of the national anthem of the PRC and other revolutionary songs. Today in global and digital Shanghai the building is a first class restaurant  La Villa Rouge  and a museum where colonial Shanghai is staged, but where long playing records from the revolutionary era are simultaneously displayed in showcases. In this strange space one consumes delicious food in rooms filled with giant gramophones and black and white portraits of female jazz stars  both reminiscent of the evaporated golden past. This paper interrogates this heterogenous and multi-rhythmic timespace (Lefebvre 1992/2004; May and Thrifts (eds) 2001) by suggesting that the nostalgia and memory industry uses old media forms (combined with a particular sexual politics), not only to bring back the past, but also to create a sense of retroactive futurity. We need to seriously engage the future city (of digitalization) with the city of collective memory since the enthusiasm for new communication technologies in Shanghai today  a city that strives to become the information and communication hub of the Asia Pacific  is reminiscent of the role that new media played in modernizing Shanghai in the past. Hence, temporal anchoring in Shanghai does not represent a refusal to partake in the fast-paced world (cf. Huyssen 1995); instead it pursues a memory of modernity and anchors in a bergsonain terrain of mobility and change as its natural tradition."

Out of twenty separate interviews with ten dyads of intercultural friends, the most comprehensive ten interviews from five dyads were transcribed as the primary data for the pilot analysis of this paper. Employing an integrative critical/interpretive perspective, this pilot study addresses how the ten respondents lived experiences are socially constructed and contextually constrained by macro structures and ideologies such as the linguistic hegemony of the English language, ideologies of assimilation, and etc. Findings underscore the revealing of personal information as contextual and contingent upon the nature of the friendships as well as shared or divergent cultural identifications. This study also underlines the crucial connection between personal information and self-identification."

In this essay, I argue that membership can be defined across two levels of research 1) organizational status and 2) organizational presence. Consequently, I propose a typology of organizational member positionality and coin four different types of members: revered, valued, silent, and invisible. I end the essay by highlighting how this typology not only clarifies the definition of membership but also provides an agenda for future studies in organizational communication."

The leading question, therefore, can be surmised as: Is historical journalism a gendered profession? Or do we approach journalism with gendered research patterns, so that we produce and reproduce a gendered academic discourse on journalism? In order to give some answers to these questions, I will first present the results of a research project dealing with the cultural, social and work-related positioning of women writers in German-speaking countries at the end of the 19th century, which is based on a complete census collected between 1896 and 1898. In a second step, the occupation and opus of those women writers who worked for periodicals will be analysed along established concepts of journalism in order to illustrate how women are systematically excluded by dominant concepts of what journalism is and journalists actually do."

The concept of mass communication has, however, faced persistent challenges to its continued relevance in light of changes that have taken place  and that continue to take place  in the media environment. This paper offers a counterpoint to claims of the terms diminished relevance, as well as to some recent efforts to reposition the term, by putting forth an interpretive approach that is not exclusive to the institutional communicator and that allows the term mass to extend to both the senders and receivers of messages. This paper argues that this interpretive approach is in keeping with some early interpretations of the concepts meaning, and that such an interpretation is permissible in light of the definitional ambiguity that has always surrounded the term. This paper then considers how the notion of the work of the audience is reconfigured in this new mass communication environment. As this paper illustrates, the claim of the audience engaging in watching as working merits extension in an environment of interactive media and user-generated content."

Some of this is attributable to the popularity of Barack Obama (and fear and hatred of Bush/Republicans). But much of what we are witnessing is also the product of renewed opportunities for participation presented by popular media. This paper will examine the Obama movement through the lens of 19th century partisan politics. That is, this paper analyzes the ways in which new media and popular media have created and enabled conditions for a revival of popular politics similar to those found in the last century (a period in which up to 90% of the electorate participated in politics). These include the new partisan press, enhanced means for grassroots politics, new sources for campaign contributions, the desegregation of politics from entertainment, and new avenues for popular political expression.

We conceptualize users media choice by adapting the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1990; see also Lin, 2006) and test an advanced action-oriented media-choice model in the context of video-game use. A survey study with two waves (N1 = 2028; N2 = 592) is conducted to test the applicability of the model using hierarchical regressions analyses and maximum likelihood procedures. Results show that attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant predictors of intention to play respondents named video game (R2 = .77). Consistent with the theory, intention is also a significant predictor for the amount of video-game use (R2 = .23). In addition to TOPB components, compulsiveness and past behavior have significant impacts on the amount of video-game use. We discuss implications of our findings and finally review the theoretical progress made and provide ideas about how to further advance the line of research."

The swastika has an infamous connotation in the Western world today being associated with Nazism and the horrors of Holocaust. Yet its positive meaning in Eastern cultures and its usage as a religious motif have sustained. The study conducts textual analysis of 18 American online forums, nine personal homepages and blogs that discuss the symbolic significance and the future of the swastika in the West with reference to a proposed ban of the swastika by the European Union in 2005. The paper aims to analyze the symbolic significance of the swastika among a Western (namely US) audience and examines the motivations of a negative interpretation of the swastika by the latter. The paper examines the negotiation of meaning-making of the swastika among the Western audiences at multiple levels and the latters utilization of possible binary oppositions for classifying Eastern religious symbols. Overall, the oppositional viewpoints encompassed in the online forums, which include many visceral reactions to the swastika itself, provide a unique opportunity to delineate evolving cultural outlooks in a multiracial society."

At the heart of civil society is discourse. This discourse is the nexus of civil society when it allows all interested parties to participate in the public sphere. There are critiques of civil society from this public relations perspective. Dutta-Bergman (2005) has criticized that many activities under the guise of civil society development are actually anti development and imperialistic. The chances that anti development and imperialistic forces can co-opt the great potential of civil society is minimized if we focus on the co-creation of meaning and rhetorical discourse in the marketplace of ideas. When we view civil society as a process where all parties can use language to inform and persuade, then public relations scholars, practitioners and critical theorists have a rationale and method for critiquing instances of anti development and imperialist messages and activities.

The role for public relations is civil society is quite clear. When we focus on meaning making, language, rhetorical argument, and persuasion, then we have enormous potential to see how public relations theory can serve democratic interests. The dominant theories of public relations can be complemented by civil societys interest in how individuals and organizations can participate in what Heath called the wrangle of the marketplace.

This presentation provides specific examples of how rhetoric is being used by NGOs, business organizations, and activists in deciding civil society topics.

2009-1282,Rhetoric of Self-Regulation: Correctives or Quiescence?,Discourse and Dialogue: A Public Relations Approach to Organizational Rhetoric,,,,Paper,Rhetoric of Self-Regulation: Correctives or Quiescence?,Discourse and Dialogue: A Public Relations Approach to Organizational Rhetoric,"Issues management remains a key means of influencing policy decisions. Though it has been expanding beyond the initial parameters of public policy, Howard Chase developed issues management as a way for corporations to engage more effectively in public policy decisions. Issues management is a process that involves the application of a variety of tactics during different stages of an issues life cycle. This paper explores the use of self-regulation as a tactic in issues management. More specifically, it explores the utility and dangers of the public discussion of self-regulation, what is termed the rhetoric of self-regulation.

Corporations seek to avoid regulation because of the costs. One cost is the expense of compliance with the regulation and the paperwork necessary to document compliance. Time and resources must be devoted to the new regulation. A second cost is the constraints imposed by the regulation. A regulation prescribes what an organization can and cannot do in certain areas. For instance, increases in Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÉ), the fuel efficiency of a vehicle fleet, require automobile manufacturers to adjust the design and production of their vehicles to meet the new requirements. This limits, in some ways, the types of vehicles a company will produce because the average fleet miles per gallon must be maintained. Self-regulation is preferred because the corporations decide the voluntary limits prescribed by self-regulation.

The paper uses two cases to illustrate the utility of self-regulation in issues management and the need to critically evaluate self-regulations efforts. The first case involves efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to self-regulate direct to consumer advertising (DTC). The second case involves the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) voluntary rating system of video games.

The paper concludes by reviewing the pros and cons of the rhetoric of self-regulation. Ideas are presented to help guide peoples evaluations of a self-regulation argument. The focus is on helping people become better consumers of issues management messages by identifying salient features that should be applied to the rhetoric of self-regulation.

Unfortunately, The Los Angeles Times used the alley for the storage of printers ink which facilitated a more intense explosion. This was neither the first or last instance of violence against American capitalist interests commissioned by John J. (JJ) McNamara. The purpose of this paper is to examine the ways in which the arrests of John J. and James B. McNamara and the trial of James B. McNamara facilitated debate regarding labor and capital interests in the Appeal to Reason and The Los Angeles Times respectively. The two newspapers espoused diametrically opposed ideologies as The Los Angeles Times championed the individualist, laissez-faire economic spirit of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century America capitalism while the Appeal to Reason defended the cause of labor and supported Socialism. The bombing of The Los Angeles Times and the trial of James B. McNamara helped to focus the debate on labor and capital. This study aims to explore an underdeveloped topic in communication studies, the rhetorics of internal terrorism as well as explore the ways in which the opposing media outlets in question presented sensational news stories."

Research has yet to consider how Jon Stewart expresses his Jewish identity in his role as host of The Daily Show. This article explores how Stewart uses the text of the program to express his Jewishiness and also examines how young Jewish audiences receive and interpret Stewarts performance. The findings presented in this article suggest that Stewart represents a powerful force in the New Jew Revolution or the movement to identify with all things Jewish and cool.

It draws upon the Risk Perception Attitude framework and explores the interactive effects of perceived risk and efficacy and differences in information seeking among four attitude groups (responsive, avoidance, proactive, indifference) formed by crossing high and low in perceived risk and efficacy. Analysis of the 2003 Health Information National Trend Survey (HINTS) found no interaction between perceived risk and efficacy. Perceived risk is a significant predictor of information seeking, whereas perceived efficacy has no impact. Different attitude groups do differ in their information seeking behavior. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

However, their isolation from their home offices also renders them distinct from domestic political journalists. Consequently, studies of Brussels correspondents have come up with their own viable types of political journalism in Brussels. With the ongoing enlargement of the European Union--and a growing number of post-communist new member states--we need to re-define current typologies of Brussels journalism. Prior findings indicate that post-communist journalists have not yet evolved a fixed set of professional roles, norms and values. Thus, their work in Brussels may be characterized by a different approach towards correspondent journalism. As part of a study on Brussels correspondents, role conceptions of correspondents from post-communist new member states were examined. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 14 journalists from different new member states show that explicative, objective and rapid information-gathering are the most important constituents of political journalism in Brussels. As a consequence of the highly-complex subject matter of EU reporting and declining support from home offices, journalists see it as their highest goal to explain the EU and make the EU decision-making process in Brussels better understood. Along this line, other forms of political journalism, such as investigative and critical reporting, are neglected."

Empirical evidence is presented on the basis of interviews with 1900 journalists from 19 countries and information about their respective news organizations. A cluster analysis identified four general journalistic milieus: detached disseminator, activist mobilizer, populist observer, and opportunist facilitator. Using multiple correspondence analysis, the four professional milieus were then mapped onto the journalistic field. The journalists perceived autonomy, the extent to which they were guided by market values, as well as the news organizations reliance on advertizing served as empirical indicators of the journalistic field. The results confirmed central assumptions of field theory: The milieus of the populist observer and opportunist facilitator scored low on autonomy but high on market orientation and reliance on advertising."

Specifically, the research examines the different flows of information in the three states and the role that traditional communication and mediated communication (including local, government-sponsored, independent, and international media) play in how Darfurians understand the peace process.

The data are based on over 100 interviews and oral histories of Darfurians. The 18-month study shows that Darfurians are influenced by a variety of internal and external events. Their experiences over the last 25 years (since the Famine of 1984) provide powerful frameworks for interpreting the peace process.

Using Strauss and Corbin's (1990) qualitative data analysis framework, three findings emerged: Darfurians continue to rely on traditional communication systems, government media sources do not often address the conflict in Darfur, and international sources such as the BBC provide a macro perspective."

We propose a health socialization model and apply it to examine direct, relative, and mediating roles of interpersonal and media health socialization agents in under-served adolescent health literacy. Our data show that both interpersonal channels and media are equally important socialization agents for adolescent health literacy. Media socialization agents and health literacy can reinforce each other, perhaps creating an upward spiral of health literacy. We suggest that adolescent health behaviors should be understood through the complex interplay among health literacy, interpersonal and media socialization agents, and multi-level factors, and our health socialization model can contribute to better understanding of adolescent health."

This investigation also tested the extent to which the effects of the prime dissipated across the evaluation period. After hearing a sexual-, aggressive- or thinking-themed music prime, individuals evaluated an object that was either related to entertainment media or unrelated to entertainment. The related object was casually evaluated, whereas the unrelated object required more careful evaluation. These differences were in response to studies that show priming effects are stronger when evaluating objects related to the prime, as well as studies that show priming effects are weaker when the evaluation is more carefully performed. Results show that music primes affected both types of evaluations and suggest that primes can either elevate or suppress different evaluation criteria depending on the type of evaluation performed."

By using the universal concept of human rights to justify their decision, the California Supreme Court moved the issue into more protected and harder-to-argue-with legal territory. On that same day, as gays and lesbians rejoiced in California and around the world, opponents of same-sex marriage announced their efforts to submit for popular referendum a ballot measure (Proposition 8), which would make same-sex marriage illegal in the state. Both the Supreme Court decision and the fight to enact a same-sex marriage ban in the state have received wide media coverage in the U.S. and abroad. This paper uses media framing theory to examine how the five largest circulation daily newspapers in the U.S. have covered Proposition 8 in the six weeks before the elections. By identifying the main media frames used in the coverage, the paper intends to shed light on the way this issue was presented for discussion in the public arena."

However, reviewing the conceptual debate of satellite communication over the last years, reveals that this phenomenon is reflected in conceptual debates within our discipline in three ways: (1) in the context of diasporic cultures, (2) in relation to a supranationalization of political satellite channels, such as Al Jazeera (3) as a globalized media form. However, this paper will suggest a fourth stream for a much needed analysis of the construction of subnational public terrains as a model for the investigation of subjective media spheres. Based on Muenchs and Habermas notion of interpenetration of lifeworld and system, this paper will make an attempt to unfold the theoretical debate about mediation as a new discoursive sphere. In this sense, mediation and mediatization processes structure communicative schemes which not only transform conventional terminologies of media and audiences but define ontological spheres in subnational public communicative spaces."

Voters witnessed a veritable explosion of self-made and professionally produced video parodies and satires on-line. I will offer a critical exploration of various factors associated with production, distribution, and exhibition of such videos. These include issues such as political satire for profit (Funny or Die, Barely Political, 23/6, The Onion); viral and corporate distribution (Hulu, blogs, cable news); narrative threads of competing satires (Obama Girl and competitors, Will.i.ams Yes We Can and satiric responses, McCain vs. Paris); and satirical yet sincere appeals to older voters (The Great Schlep; Talk to Your Parents About John McCain).

2009-1294,Satirical Goldmines: How the Real News Cashes in on the Fake,Political Entertainments Coverage of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election,,,,Paper,Satirical Goldmines: How the Real News Cashes in on the Fake,Political Entertainments Coverage of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election,"I propose to discuss the ways in which the fake news format has influenced some cable shows representation of campaign coverage. Its not uncommon for the straight news to borrow comedy bits from the fake news to use as their leads, but two popular MSNBC pundit style news shows, Countdown with Keith Olbermann and The Rachel Maddow Show routinely use satire in their coverage of campaign news. One technique operating across these formats is the juxtaposition of party politicos or campaign representatives contradicting themselves. Recently the Daily Show used this technique to comment on the hypocrisy of Republican pundits on the VP nomination of Sarah Palin, then received over 4 million hits on YouTube. The idea that the cable straight news is interested in capitalizing on the gotcha laughter this technique and others elicit from audiences attending to election coverage warrants discussion.

However, their analysis of the phenomenon is problematic in that it equates deregulation with a ""commercial deluge (2004: 125). This analogy masks the true causes of savage deregulation under certain conditions, as well as its potential benefits under repressive regimes. Greece and Thailand are used comparatively to analyze the distinct causes and results of savage deregulation in the European and global context."
2009-1296,Scare Sell? A Framing Analysis of News Coverage of the Recalled Chinese Products,What Framing Studies of News Reveal About China,,,,Paper,Scare Sell? A Framing Analysis of News Coverage of the Recalled Chinese Products,What Framing Studies of News Reveal About China,"The objective of this study is to explore whether the U.S. media overemphasized the recalled Chinese products in 2007, if so, how did news coverage of the U.S. media differ from that of the Chinese media? By using a framing analysis of two U.S. media and two Chinese media coverage, this study pursues answers of the questions.

After comparing the news coverage of the recalled Chinese products and a real world indictor, this study found that both U.S. media and Chinese media did not mirror the real world phenomenon as it was. By analyzing news coverage of the issue in The New York Times, The Associated Press, and China Daily, and The Xinhua News Agency in 2007, the study shows that news coverage of the recalled issues was different in terms of the sources, the source nationality, dominant frames, and attributions of the problems.

In particular, Chinese media more frequently employed government officials as main sources, which inherently increased the thematic frames. By contrast, U.S. media often used episodic frames with voices of customers. Likewise, U.S. media approached the issues with Customers Worries and Broken System frames, whereas Chinese media often attempted to defend the quality of Chinese products and criticized Western media for exaggerating the issues. Owing to the news framing process, U.S. audience might have more negative images about Chinese products and China in general. By contrast, Chinese counterparts might increase antipathy and distrust over the American media."
2009-1297,"Schmoozing and Smiting: Trust, Social Institutions and Communication Patterns in an MMOG",cial Interactions in Virtual Groups,,,,Paper,"Schmoozing and Smiting: Trust, Social Institutions and Communication Patterns in an MMOG",Social Interactions in Virtual Groups,"The present study examines how trust is related to online social institutions, self-disclosure, mode of communication, and message privacy in a popular MMOG, Everquest 2. The findings, which are based on survey and behavioral data from over 3,500 players, provide insights into the potential for MMOGs to act as social institutions for interpersonal interaction that support trust-development. Trust was higher within closer social circles: trust in teammates was found to be higher than trust of others in the game more generally, which was found to be higher than trust of others online. Self-disclosure was positively related to trust of others in the game and on players teams, but voice chat was not related to trust of others in the game, nor were public messages sent to the whole team related to trust in the team. Overall, this research indicates that social structures and communication processes contribute to trust development in MMOGs, supporting the claim that these online spaces provide a layer of social solidarity that has eroded in other realms of our society."
2009-1298,"Science Fiction, Promises, and Threats in Popular Communication","cience Fiction: Science and Society, Communicating the Future",,,,Paper,"Science Fiction, Promises, and Threats in Popular Communication","Science Fiction: Science and Society, Communicating the Future","This paper documents the link between Science and Science-fiction (Sci-fi) in popular conception of risks associated with bio-terrorism and bio-technology. Scientists often have difficulty translating their evaluation of potential outcomes to popular audiences; in response to these difficulties tropes and terms from Sci-fi are mobilized as resources for framing risk and promise in popular communication. Through this use of Sci-fi as a resource, fictional or literary concepts shape conversations between experts and the broader community, and the popularization of these ideas impacts research choice and funding availability.

Drawing on theories of active communication, I construct a narrative analysis of the impact of Sci-fi on policy and popular conception of risk; and I suggest that the privileged position of science makes it imperative to interrogate this interaction. I suggest an ongoing bi-directional communication between popular community and experts that includes Sci-fi as part of a key shared repertoire to describe outcomes. References to science fiction are used to explain and justify research, and, in turn scientists participation in popular culture influences their imaginaries such that scientific predictions and science fiction tend to grow more similar over time."

Through discourse analysis of news articles and interviews with journalists as well as a straightforward quantitative analysis of Mexican newspaper coverage of the election, Mexican media were found to acquiesce to globalization and U.S. hegemony. Pressures against Mexican sovereignty from other nations and from within Mexico were examined. Several key sovereignty issues were identified where they emerged through an analysis of the election agenda in several nationally distributed newspapers. A textual analysis of news stories describes threats to Mexican sovereignty on economic and political fronts, but those stories were relatively rare. In-depth interviews revealed Mexicos media elites largely accept globalization as a given, and nationalism is not a driving factor in Mexican politics today."
2009-1300,Searching for the Symbol in Hip-Hop Music: Wreaking Havoc in the Classroom With Burkes Agency,Top Papers in Instructional & Developmental Communication,,,,Paper,Searching for the Symbol in Hip-Hop Music: Wreaking Havoc in the Classroom With Burkes Agency,Top Papers in Instructional & Developmental Communication,"This essay examines rap or hip-hop musics overwhelming popularity among the 16-25 age group and offers interpretations and definitions from Kenneth Burkes text that might explain the musics disturbing side-effects, particularly in the K-12 classroom. Though dozens of essays and articles, even books, have been written on the subject of hip-hop and rap music, few of these authors or scholars have actually spent any significant time in the public school to observe the behavior and perceived attitudes of students who are not only immersed in the music but proceed to reenact, stage and live the defiance of that music in the classroom.
I use Kenneth Burkes definition of the word agency (A Grammar of Motives) as a tool for not only explaining the disturbing symbiosis between the rap artist and the rap listener, but the fall-out of gangsta rap in the classroom. Though hip-hop music certainly has value, I contend that much of it (particularly so-called gangsta rap) does not. In fact, the misogynism, nihilism and violence espoused in the majority of the lyrics has a carry-over effect that spills over into the hallways of school classrooms of urban and suburban public schools, alike (Daspit, 2000). I also contend that it is the inherent racism and commodification of black images of violence, sexual depravity and blood-thirsty gun battles that is not only condoned but encouraged by the media and critics, alike, to perpetuate racist stereotypes for the entertainment of White America, specifically white male teenagers."

An experiment was conducted using the teen prescription drug abuse issue to see the transfer of substantive attribute and affective attribute. For substantive attribute, parental involvement to prevent teen prescription drug abuse was suggested. This study also used the gain/loss framing of health communication as an affective attributes. It was found that the parental involvement attribute became salient to the subjects when it was salient in the PSAs. Also, the parental involvement attribute was more salient than either the gain or loss attributes. However, the loss attribute did not become more salient than the gain attribute."
2009-1302,Secrecy and Organization-Public Relationships: The Processes and Consequences of Secrecy-Communication Strategies,Bridge Building in Public Relations: Organization--Public Relationships,,,,Paper,Secrecy and Organization-Public Relationships: The Processes and Consequences of Secrecy-Communication Strategies,Bridge Building in Public Relations: Organization--Public Relationships,"Organizational secrecy is often perceived as an integral part of organizational decision-making, and has substantial influence on publics. Bok (1989) suggests that secrecy may accompany the most innocent as well as the most lethal acts; yet, secrecy also carries with it vital elements for organizational survival. Based on this proposition, this research focuses on a theoretical explanation of the processes and consequences of organizational secrecy, particularly as it influences organization-public relationships. Based on two experiments, we present three studies about organizational secrecy and the underlying processes through which it affects the relationship quality with its publics. In the first study (N = 80), we examined the effects of secrecy on organization-public relationships; in the second study (N = 240), we examined different types of secrecy-communication strategies and whether they would preserve the quality of organization-public relationships; and in the third study (N = 240), we tested a theoretical model to examine how and why secrecy-communication strategies influence relationships and what communicative consequences could result from those publics who experience secrecy. Overall, the results suggest that organizational secrecy negatively impacts organization-public relationships. We discuss ethical and practical implications of secrecy communication strategies for organizational communication and public relations."

The present study surveyed 120 fourth and fifth graders to examine the relationship between sensation seeking and media use. High sensation seekers (HSS) were more likely than low sensation seekers (LSS) to surf the Internet and play video games involving fighting. Marginally significant relationships were found between HSS and two other behaviors: playing massive multi-player online role playing games (MMORPGs) and bringing a prohibited cell phone to school. The results suggest that sensation seeking is related to deviant behavior at a very young age and that life-cycle models may be a useful addition to the sensation seeking literature."

Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,,,,Paper,Seeing is Believing? Methodological Considerations and Complications in Combining Eye-Tracking With Other Methods Researching Visuals,What You See is What You Get? Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology in Visual Communication Research,"This paper will present a novel approach, combining eye-tracking with iconological visual content analysis and emotional-effects measurement. Both, the benefits and the technical as well as conceptual pitfalls in fusing these three methods will be discussed. The major goal of this complex research design is to elucidate how different groups of participants perceive and interpret, as well as how they react emotionally to mass-mediated visuals as e.g., press photographs. Despite the recent increase in the visualization of news events, visual communication research lags behind and suffers particularly from a lack of empirical data on how similar or how different individuals perceive and interpret visual news. The unique combination of research methodology suggested in this paper provides a first step into the direction of understanding three processes crucial for the functions and effects of visual news communication: attention allocation, meaning-attribution, and emotional reactions as well as the relationship between the three processes.

Previous research has found that the character of visual images in mass media influences the memorability as well as emotional response in viewers (Crigler, Just, & Neuman, 1994). Dramatic, vivid visuals have been associated with increased recall of specific story information as well as improved retention for the newscast overall (Graber, 1990, 1993; Robinson & Levy, 1986). Moreover, it has been confirmed that negative compelling visuals are particularly potent and capture peoples attention (Grabe, Zhou, A. Lang, & Bolls, 2000).
To test proposed hypotheses, an experiment study involving news coverage of the North Korean nuclear test was conducted. The experiment took the form of a mixed subjects 2 (News Intensity) X 2 (Leader Reaction Potency) factorial design. As one of the focal variables, recognition memory was measured using a set of multiple-choice questions.
The study found that there was a significant main effect of presidential reaction potency on news memory. In other words, viewers recalled news information better when presidential reaction potency was high as opposed to when it was low. In terms of visual intensity, however, no significant main effect on recognition memory for news information was found in the analysis. As for the interactive news-presidential reaction sequences, the study found that the high intensity news-low reaction potency sequences revealed the highest mean accuracy scores in individual memory, whereas the low intensity news-low reaction potency sequences produced the lowest mean scores."

Using structural equation modeling (SEM) and data from the Pew Research Center, information-seeking motives for news viewing are found to have a direct and positive impact on acquisition of political knowledge, while entertainment-seeking motives have a direct, but negative impact on political knowledge, even controlling for education, income, political interest, and age. Both kinds of motives are significantly related to the mediating variable of news media attention, but have opposing impacts. Information-seeking motives significantly increase attention, while entertainment-seeking significantly decrease attention. The findings of this study call attention to the importance of identifying motivational sources other than seeking surveillance gratifications that can influence the learning of political information."
2009-1307,"Seeking Justice: The Veil, Race, and Feminist Politics","lam, Culture, and Identity: Moving Beyond False Binaries",,,,Paper,"Seeking Justice: The Veil, Race, and Feminist Politics","Islam, Culture, and Identity: Moving Beyond False Binaries","The increased visibility of veiled bodies in Britain and Europe today has stirred a response that draws on long-standing Orientalist oppositions and reworks them in the current climate of the war on terror, connecting them to parallel racist discourses about threats to British culture. Media coverage of this issue has displaced the question of the right to civic freedom onto an a-historical conceptualization of culture which relies on unstated assumptions about British/European culture as cohesive, liberal, sealed (until the intrusion of the masked other) and ultimately superior. Both sides of this perceived clash have been reduced to a familiar either/or dichotomy which pits progress, liberalism and modernity against tradition, intolerance and Islam. By focusing solely on questions of gender equality and by correlating equality with visible signs of agency, some feminists and left of centre commentators have side-stepped broader questions of inequality and social justice. For instance, banning the veil and public attacks on Muslim womens use of it constitutes a major obstacle to the participation of some Muslim women in public life. By pitting multiculturalism against feminism, equality against culture, and cultural relativism against universal values, such approaches neglect the fact that individuals and communities are socially embedded and that identities are formed and reformed in the context of social relations. This paper argues for a broader and more multi-dimensional understanding of justice not just along the axis of gender but also along other axes of social differentiation and subordination, above all in this context, class, race, nationality and religion. It re-examines the academic and media debates on veiled bodies, engages both with issues of European Islam and with the limits of secular liberalism, and argues for a more critical and multi-dimensional account of Muslim and European culture. It moves beyond culturalist approaches which see the veil as a mere symbol of ethnic and/or religious back ground, as well as the equally problematic neo-liberal focus on choice and individuality."

Understanding audience dynamics is especially important as several decades of research has shown that effectively framing and communicating a complex, contested issue such as climate change is neither simple nor straightforward. In this paper, we demonstrate how audience segmentation analysis, appropriately conducted, can be used to identify motivationally coherent segments of the public for whom appropriate message frames can be identified. In 2007, we conducted a telephone survey of a representative sample of American adults (N=1,980). We asked 21 questions to assess three broad domains: global warming beliefs, behaviors, and policy preferences. Using latent class analysis we identified six distinct audience segments ranging in size from 11 to 22% of the full sample. We report the findings of this analysis, including our inferences and hypotheses about the optimal issue frames for each segment."

Im interested in the ways in which the discourses and practices of promotionalism have come to dominate and define self-production and self-valorization in terms favorable to contemporary post-Fordist capitalism. I am also interested in looking at the ways mainstream media programs, specifically reality television, construct narratives of self-making at the same time as they actively produce people as profitable image-commodities (aka branded selves). These television programs both mythologize and market a self marked by perpetual flexibility, attention-getting ability and consumer prowess. An analysis that focuses on the intersection of cultural production, political economy, promotionalism and selfhood can help us to understand consumer society as a rampant form of biopower. Given the current global financial meltdown delineating the ways in which this form of biopower operates, and in whose interests, is more crucial than ever."

Eighty online daters identified the deceptions in their online dating profiles, and had their photograph taken. A group of independent judges rated online daters physical attractiveness based on the lab photographs, and another group of judges rated the attractiveness of daters main profile photograph. Results show that less attractive online daters used deception strategically to improve their physical appearance: they enhanced the attractiveness of their profile photograph, and also lied more about their physical descriptors (height, age) than more attractive daters. However, less attractive daters did not lie more on profile elements unrelated to their physical appearance (e.g., income, occupation). Results are discussed in terms of (1) evolutionary theories about the importance of physical attractiveness in the dating realm, and (2) the technological affordances that allow online daters to engage in selective self-presentation."
2009-1311,Selling Free Speech: Advertising and the First Amendment,Reconceptualizing Communication History,,,,Paper,Selling Free Speech: Advertising and the First Amendment,Reconceptualizing Communication History,"The purpose of the First Amendment has been subject to considerable debate. Should the First Amendment protect wealthy commercial interests, even at the expense of public debate and public safety? Although free speech protection was not to intended to protect elite economic interests, it has been re-interpreted in recent decades to include protection for commercial speech, departing from key values of the First Amendment. Some theorists argue that critical discourse is threatened by protections for commercial speech; whereas others maintain it has significance for public discourse. In the landmark Supreme Court case Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Counsel, Inc. (1976) the Supreme Court could find no justification for excluding profit-oriented speech from First Amendment protection. Relying on media history as well as trade press articles from the advertising industry and the drug industry, this paper examines the historical conditions and key players involved in the decision to provide protection for commercial speech. A historical analysis of the major groups involvedadvertisers, pharmacists, media outlets, and consumer groupsprovides further evidence to support the notion that First Amendment protection for commercial speech strays significantly from its democratic purpose."

This study also explores how gay and lesbian respondents understand their role as distinct consumers in relation to gay social movements. In contrast to cultural critiques that argue that constructions of gay consumer markets are antithetical to gay social movements, this study shows how actual gay and lesbian consumers not only understand this dialectic, but also use it as both self-validation and as leverage in achieving social gains."

Building on the theories of Orientalism, male gaze, stereotyping and literature on the representations of Chinese in mass media, examination of character type shows that the trailers are dominated by action heroes. While Chinese men are more likely to be shown in the action hero type, Chinese women are more likely to be shown as sexual and passive. In addition, China is portrayed dominantly as pristine, a place full of mystery, chaos and devoid of modern qualities. As a hybrid of Chinese self-representation and Western construction, the trailers reflect the Orientalist perspective and objectification of women. In the sense that the action hero is the most popular stereotype of Chinese on the screen, and the submissive and sexual female is the conventional portrayal of gender in the US, the Chinese movie trailers promote and sell the other in a familiar way, reinforcing the hegemonic view of both the race and gender."

In recent years, there has also been a growing trend to sensationalize foreign news coverage, especially in terms of the way it is presented on television. This paper compares foreign and domestic news in terms of several indicators of sensationalism and conflict: topics: ""actors,"" graphics, animation, background music, slow and speeded up motion, repetition of visuals, gory visuals, soft focus, color change, and extreme emotion. We assume that, in order to attract viewers and keep them tuned to foreign news, conflict and sensational news themes and their presentation styles are played up more in foreign than in domestic news. In addition, increasing media privatization and competition among commercial television channels in many countries seems to be sensationalizing the news. Thus the paper also examines potential differences between commercial and public service stations in terms of the ways they cover foreign news events."

Transportation theory suggests that narrative immersion in a story may moderate reader arousal, and thus HSS message selection. To test this idea, a survey was administered to 120 fourth and fifth graders. In addition to measuring sensation seeking and transportation, the survey assessed interest in reading and writing outside of school (i.e., leisure reading and writing). HSS were found to be less likely to engage in leisure reading. A moderated mediation analysis revealed that whether HSS engaged in leisure reading hinged on their level of narrative transportation (moderator) and subsequent reader boredom (mediator). HSS that successfully transported while reading were no different than their low sensation seeking peers. Sensation seeking was unrelated to leisure writing. Strategies for increasing leisure reading as well as constructing narratives that are engaging to HSS children are discussed."

2009-1318,Setting Stage for the Sixties: Restrictions on Speech About Drugs in America Prior to 1968 (Top Three Paper),Media Governance: Understanding Processes of Content Control,,,,Paper,Setting Stage for the Sixties: Restrictions on Speech About Drugs in America Prior to 1968 (Top Three Paper),Media Governance: Understanding Processes of Content Control,"Scholars from a variety of disciplines have observed that the coverage of the hallucinogenic drug LSD in popular magazines in the 1950s and 1960s seemed to stoke public interest in the drug. The lack of drug information in the mass media during much of the first half of the twentieth century may have helped this magazine coverage to have such a strong effect. Speech about other, illegal drugs was restricted in much of the media prior to the 1960s through a variety of means, including obscenity law and industry codes. This study examined some of the legal and pseudo-legal mechanisms that controlled speech about drugs and explored why LSD may have been covered differently in popular magazines."

(Attribute) Agenda Setting Studies",,,,Paper,Setting the Investment Agenda: Evidence From Closed-End Country Funds,"""What to Think About?"" and ""How to Think?"" (Attribute) Agenda Setting Studies","Despite the importance of American investment to developing nations, there is little evidence concerning the factors that explain why Americans decide to invest in particular countries. Adopting the theory of agenda-setting, we hypothesize that news media coverage plays a significant role in shaping investor confidence. Using a sample of 41 closed-end country funds from 26 countries, we demonstrate that variations in both the amount and tone of coverage allocated to specific nations influence the volatility and value of fund prices. We further demonstrate that investors not only respond to news focusing on the state of the target nations economy, but are also sensitive to issues of national security or political stability."
2009-1320,Sex After 50: A Qualitative Study on Mature Womens Sexual Health Attitudes,Communication About Sexual Health,,,,Paper,Sex After 50: A Qualitative Study on Mature Womens Sexual Health Attitudes,Communication About Sexual Health,"The current study addresses sexual health risk perceptions among sexually active women over the age of 50. The purpose of the research is to shed light on the issues and obstacles identified by members of this group in an effort to make recommendations for actions that will promote positive behaviors in people who continue to pursue active sex lives into their senior years. Four focus groups were conducted with women over the age of 50 years old. The findings suggest that single and dating women over 50 are concerned about sexually transmitted disease, but may be hesitant to discuss these issues with their primary care physician who may assume they already are informed and that women in this age group appear to need strategies for negotiating condom use with partners who may be resistant."
2009-1321,"Sexual Dangers, Risky Individuals, and Online Identity Verification: A Comparison of United States and European Union Initiatives","Personal Surveillance, Digitized Identity, and Control in National and Transnational Contexts",,,,Paper,"Sexual Dangers, Risky Individuals, and Online Identity Verification: A Comparison of United States and European Union Initiatives","Personal Surveillance, Digitized Identity, and Control in National and Transnational Contexts","Recent national and international regulatory initiatives highlight an increased concern for childrens internet safety. The U.S. approach, most recently epitomized by the passage of the KIDS Act of 2008 and of the PROTECT our Children Act, has ushered in a new social investment in potentially exportable technologies for identity verification, age identification, and for matching convicted sex offenders to their online identities through online biometrics, public record surveillance and portable credential verification. However, by comparing recent U.S. initiatives to the E.U. approach to internet safety, this paper argues that the American focus on technology platforms for the surveillance of risky individuals and their potential victims prioritize native definitions of deviance and privacy that might present serious jurisdictional obstacles to transnational control. By placing the analysis against the background of traditional U.S governance of sexual danger for children, the paper argues that the American approach continues to favor exclusive and discriminatory control devices rather than media awareness education."
2009-1322,"Sexual Identities, Sexual Practices, Relational Possibilities: Unpacking Discourses From 'Top' to 'Bottom'",Queering the Qualitative: Exploring Qualitative Research Methods as a Tool for Inquiry Into Diverse Sexual Identities,,,,Paper,"Sexual Identities, Sexual Practices, Relational Possibilities: Unpacking Discourses From 'Top' to 'Bottom'",Queering the Qualitative: Exploring Qualitative Research Methods as a Tool for Inquiry Into Diverse Sexual Identities,"This study explores 62 depth interviews with self-identified gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals regarding notions of the terms 'top,' 'bottom,' and 'versatile' in relation to sexual identity, sexual practice, and relational understandings. Explored through relational-dialectical (Baxter & Montgomery, 1996) and queer theory (Jagose, 1996) lenses, the data is analyzed for constructions of what it means to be top, bottom, or versatile both in terms of sexual practice and in terms of its implications upon gay, lesbian, or bisexual identity. This leads to discussions of how the words have different meanings for different sexual identities; yet overarching commonalities exist across sexual orientations and are particularly relationship-oriented for bisexual individuals (although most individuals reported some flexibility with identity depending upon specific relationships). The data is also explored for how relational possibilities are constructed by those who self-identify under the various terms, including how the terms translate into relational roles (based on this data, they do not); how they play into relational tensions (they very much do, especially as relationships mature); and how individual sexual practice identities within relationships play into larger notions of how individuals in a relationship read the relationship (as well as how those outside the relationship may read the relationship). Larger discussion concerns the implications of queering relational-dialectical theory and relational practices."
2009-1323,Sexualising Girls: Concerning Television Fiction Made for Children,Gender in Childrens TV Worldwide,,,,Paper,Sexualising Girls: Concerning Television Fiction Made for Children,Gender in Childrens TV Worldwide,"This paper reflects on research being undertaken in relation to the eroticisation of girl characters in childrens television fiction. It is informed by a constructivist and poststructural feminist framework and engages with the nature of the discourses around childhood and gender in particular. In addition it draws on Valerie Walkerdines (1997) concerns with the construction of desire among young girls, (the targeted audiences of such popular cultural products) and the potential class dimensions she identifies. This research follows on from the large scale content analysis. A purposive sample enables clear instances of scripts that present girls in sexualised ways. Attention is paid to questions of bodies, behaviours, dress and gestures. This is undertaken in relation both to probing both the nature of the construction of the eroticised gender identities that are validated in these spaces and to their implications."
2009-1324,Sexuality Difference and Sexually Oriented Advertising: An Exploratory Analysis of the Third-Person Effect,formation Systems Poster Session,,,,Paper,Sexuality Difference and Sexually Oriented Advertising: An Exploratory Analysis of the Third-Person Effect,Information Systems Poster Session,"This study attempted to investigate the influences of gender and sexual cognition on the third-person effect in the context of sexually oriented advertising. A 2 (male vs. female) x 2 (sexually oriented advertising vs. sexually absented advertising) between-subjects experiment with a covariate (sexual cognition) was designed in this study. The results indicated that advertising type, gender, and sexual cognition were significant factors in influencing the third-person effect. In the context of sexual oriented advertising, the study also found that females would have a stronger degree of the third-person effect than males. Moreover, people with a more negative level of sexual cognition would have a stronger degree of the third-person effect than those with a more positive level of sexual cognition after their exposure to sexually oriented advertising."
2009-1325,"Shifting the Valence Balance: Resonance, Resistance, and Countervalence of Cognitive Responses to Communication Frames",Cognitive Approaches to Framing,,,,Paper,"Shifting the Valence Balance: Resonance, Resistance, and Countervalence of Cognitive Responses to Communication Frames",Cognitive Approaches to Framing,"While people often follow frames in opinion formation, they are also capable of resisting or even counteracting frames under certain circumstances. This paper investigates the cognitive processes that lead people to follow or resist frames, stressing the importance of cognitive responses to framed messages. It develops a schematic model of the frame-cognition interaction and specifies the conditions under which resistance and countervalent responses are expected. The paper experimentally tests the predictions measuring individuals spontaneous associations with framed messages (N=357). It finds that people counteract frames if these are recognized as unduly biased, and follow frames if their prior attitudes are too disparate to discover frame biases. Furthermore, stronger prior attitudes decrease the strength of successful framing effects, but increase the power of countervalent responses. Framed opinion formation is thus mediated by cognitive responses, which depend not merely on the frame or prior attitudes alone, but on a non-linear interaction between both."
2009-1326,"Shyness, Sociability, and the Role of Media Synchronicity in the Use of Computer-Mediated Communication",cial and Socialization Motives for ICT Use,,,,Paper,"Shyness, Sociability, and the Role of Media Synchronicity in the Use of Computer-Mediated Communication",Social and Socialization Motives for ICT Use,"Previous research suggests that computer-mediated communication (CMC) media appeal especially to shy individuals because such technologies afford a safe and comfortable environment to express ones inner feelings and opinions to others. The present study analyzed how university students with varying degrees of shyness and sociability utilized their repertoire of CMC media channels for interpersonal communication. Because spontaneous communication could be stressful for those who are socially anxious, it was hypothesized that shy students are more likely to use asynchronous forms of CMC (e-mail, social network sites) more frequently and use synchronous forms of CMC (instant messaging, chat) less frequently. Results from an online questionnaire among a Chinese student sample provide partial support for the hypotheses and suggest distinctive usage patterns separated by media synchronicity. Moreover, regression analyses showed significant interaction effects between shyness and sociability on asynchronous CMC media use, such that high sociability accentuated the impact of shyness on frequency of e-mail and social network site usage. Conversely, high sociability reduced the impact of shyness on online chat use. Implications for future research on shyness and Internet use are discussed."
2009-1327,"Signals in Suspense: Batteries, Recording, and Data Processing",What We Now Call Communications: 20th-Century Transitions in Computers and Representation,,,,Paper,"Signals in Suspense: Batteries, Recording, and Data Processing",What We Now Call Communications: 20th-Century Transitions in Computers and Representation,"Battery technology is well known for providing access to electric current away from the confines of a power grid, making it possible for computers to move through space. At the same time, however, batteries hold data in place over time. Electricity has been a dominant transmission medium ever since the nineteenth century, but not until the coupling of batteries and information technology in the mid-twentieth century did electricity as a medium of transmission become a medium of recording. Take, for example, how batteries in early palm pilots held data in place or how batteries in video game cartridges made it possible for players to save their games. In short, batteries are both time-binding and space-binding media that negotiate between the material and symbolic layers of digital technology. This paper offers an examination of the role of batteries as a recording medium in data processing that reveals how discourses about time and communication inform contemporary notions of computing."
2009-1328,Significance of Religious Coping and Growth Among Family Caregivers of Cancer Patients in India,Communication and Coping With Cancer,,,,Paper,Significance of Religious Coping and Growth Among Family Caregivers of Cancer Patients in India,Communication and Coping With Cancer,"There has been considerable interest in relationships between religious coping and health outcomes among cancer patients. However, surprisingly little is known about religious coping among family caregivers, despite the enormous challenges they face. Moreover, few studies have been conducted outside of western developed nations. The current investigation examined the experience of family caregivers of cancer patients in Pune, India. We evaluated discrete dimensions of religious coping, and their associations with perspective transformation (i.e., positive outcomes), among families at an early phase of treatment for non-metastatic disease. Caregivers were predominantly Hindu (84.5%); they included both women and men (58.6%), and median time since diagnosis was 11.5 months. As hypothesized, results indicated that positive dimensions of religious coping (i.e., benevolent religious reappraisal; spiritual connection) were associated with higher levels of growth, while negative aspects of religious coping (i.e., punishing God reappraisal; spiritual discontent) were associated with less growth. In multivariate analyses controlling for significant covariates, the strongest predictors were positive religious reappraisals and punishing God reappraisals. Findings suggest that religious coping among Indian family caregivers is an important area of inquiry."
2009-1329,Silence as Contextual and Contested: A Dual-Level Analysis of Silence in the Roman Catholic Clergy Sex Abuse Crisis,t Is Not Our Fault: Crisis Communication In Public Relations,,,,Paper,Silence as Contextual and Contested: A Dual-Level Analysis of Silence in the Roman Catholic Clergy Sex Abuse Crisis,It Is Not Our Fault: Crisis Communication In Public Relations,"This analysis offers two approaches to tracking silence in the clergy sex abuse crisis. First, it charts each organizations discursive presence in the case across time, contextualizing how this presence ebbs and flows in the content addressed by each organization. This serves as a backdrop against which a more particular assessment of the discursive construction of silence can be traced. Second, it assesses the way in which topics are pitched, carried, and/or dropped among the three stakeholder organizations. This illustrates a particular way in which silence is enacted across the crisis communication of key stakeholder organizations. Dividing the analysis this way engages the communicative construction of silence at both macro and micro levels."
2009-1330,Silencing Ana: Framing and Censoring Identity in News Media,News and Gender,,,,Paper,Silencing Ana: Framing and Censoring Identity in News Media,News and Gender,"This paper uses discourse analysis to examine the print news medias power to frame stigmatized, non-status quo identities that do not have public self-representation. Using the online pro-ana identity as an example, this paper demonstrates the mediasand specifically journalistspower to construct discourses of identity in line with the hegemonic status quo and in opposition to group members own self-identification. Alternative discourses surrounding the pro-ana identity, such as psychological and feminist discourses, are examined, as well as the pro-ana communitys own discourse, which goes largely ignored by the print news media. These multiple and varied frames surrounding the pro-ana identity inform the discourse and framing analysis of this research project. Ultimately, the U.S. news media ignores the voices and self-identification of this group in favor of a hegemonic frame that labels them as diseased, disgusting, and in need of treatment."

Largely absent from public discourse has been discussion of the ethical root cause of the problem, as well as the ethical dimensions of various proposed solutions to the problem. In this paper, I will identify several practices of ethical organizations, including dialogic communication, transparency, participation, courage, and accountability, and explore the relationship between them and the failures of several large financial institutions. I will suggest that the cause of the failures is as much about a lack of ethical awareness, judgment, and action as it is about poor economic decisions.
In particular, the paper will examine how transparency has been historically framed as an economic good by business interests. By contrast, I argue for transparency as a broader social good that builds trust, strengthens relationships, and facilitates open, engaged, and contested dialogue about organizational practices. Historically, businesses have focused on the need for transparency in order to build relations with stockholders, but this paper focuses on the ways in which such neoliberal market discourses can limit the very notion of what is deemed an appropriate degree of transparency in a capitalist system. The paper will conclude with recommendations for how to proceed, based on current assumptions, contradictions, and limitations of current practices of transparency, specifically, and organizational ethics, generally."

But such shows are only the tip of the iceberg. The extension of televisions productive and distributive base via the internet reveals a demand for alternatives to the regime of broadcast representation: a demand for productive consumers to do it themselves. But  concomitantly it seems  the more participatory and productive public discourse becomes, the sillier it gets. Election news in particular is marked not only by 'comedy journalism,' but also by amateur spoofing, satire and parody, some of which out-rates official sources. Silly citizens send up inauthentic expression among politicians and journalists alike  unmasking the extent to which even the straightest news is faking it."

By establishing comparisons between networks from two classes of terrorists whose actions were recorded two thousand years apart, this paper adds substance to the understanding of the superiority of networks to archetypical organizational structures (i.e., with a hierarchically-based order). By identifying three major factors, many analogies can be drawn, based on empirical statements found throughout this analysis, between cyberterrorist networks in this day and age and terrorist networks in Antiquity. Those factors are (1) similar patterns of communication, (2) similar connections and kinship webs, and (3) similar obstacles."
2009-1334,Simulation and Citizen Participation: Learning From the Past,The New Media City,,,,Paper,Simulation and Citizen Participation: Learning From the Past,The New Media City,"Government officials, urban planners, and community activists have offered many claims about how new simulation technologies can improve citizen participation in local planning. Innovations such as Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) are being adopted with the goal of bringing residents into policy deliberations by teaching them about the complexity of community issues and facilitating their communications with public officials on these and other matters. Yet evidence about past efforts to employ simulation as a tool for engaging citizens in public decision-making reveals results that diverge from these optimistic predictions. This paper recounts the story of a federal program that used simulation-gaming to educate city residents about a new initiative designed to meet their needs. The past frustrations that all parties encountered in this undertaking suggests that future users of simulation tools for civic participation can learn from these technologies' history, broadly defined."

Going beyond simple analysis of positive or negative coverage, this paper proposes a larger theoretical framework for studying slanted framing in the news. The coding protocol captured nuanced dimensions of framing that subtly promote one side over the other, including the messages emotional content, complexity and identification of beneficiaries. If mainstream media consistently slant left, it should be revealed in covering a popular proposal benefiting children. Yet framing heavily favored the opposition to SCHIP expansion. Coverage of expansion was more negative than positive; opponents were the most quoted sources; negative assertions were simpler; and opposition was framed more as protecting the public interest. Theoretical implications of the findings will be explored."
2009-1336,Small Can Also be Multicultural: Rediscovering Baltic Media Characteristics in a Mixed Model,Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World,,,,Paper,Small Can Also be Multicultural: Rediscovering Baltic Media Characteristics in a Mixed Model,Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World,"This presentation is structured around the claim that the three models of Hallin and Mancini lack discussion on some crucial factors (e.g., functional, cultural, etc.) which shape media behavior and performance. This argument becomes apparent when applying the four dimensions (media markets, parallelism, professionalism, and state intervention) to other contexts beyond the ones discussed in the book Three Models of Media and Politics.
The argumentation begins with a claim that the three models are rather static as they do not sufficiently incorporate factors of, for example, evolution and change. It shows that media systems in post communist countries are perhaps the ones which are best described as mixed models where different sectors incorporate different characteristics of the three models of media and politics. These sectors have developed as certain sub-systems (the commercial sector, the PSB, the alternative media) as they were influenced through different factors of change. For instance, the broadcasting in Central and Eastern Europe was strongly influenced by politics (e.g., through EU policies); while commercial media  by general attempts of media liberalization and deregulation, and alternative media  by technological diffusion and growing importance of social and user-generated media.
The presentation focuses on small markets of the three Baltic States. First, it discloses the dominant cultural characteristics of society in regard to the evolution and workings of the media institutions and journalism. Second, by focusing on each of the three Baltic countries individually, it shows that differences emerge not only between very small states which have experienced common periods in their most recent political and economic histories; rather, it appears that a mixed model does apply in one small market, and that even a small market can be treated as multicultural."

As the graphical capabilities of these social virtual worlds increase, nonverbal face-to-face communication between avatars may be the next step. To examine the extent to which avatar facial cues may be used as an effective communication channel within virtual environments, we obtained actual in-game facial expressions across a variety of avatar types, testing whether certain variables of avatar appearance (degree of human-likeness and stereotypical avatar disposition) affect the strength of expression recognition as measured by facial mimicry. This study employs a 2 (Human Likeness) x 2 (Stereotyped Disposition) x 2 (Valence) x 3 (Repetition) mixed design and operationalizes facial mimicry through EMG change scores."
2009-1338,Smile and the World Will Smile With You: The Effects of a Virtual Agent´s Smile on Users' Evaluation and Smiling Behavior,Avatar Power,,,,Paper,Smile and the World Will Smile With You: The Effects of a Virtual Agent´s Smile on Users' Evaluation and Smiling Behavior,Avatar Power,"Recent studies demonstrate that people show social reactions when interacting with virtual agents. Human users e.g. behave in a socially desirable way, show increased cooperation or apply human-like communication. Most research, however, focused on behavior that might have been produced consciously, e.g. due to demand characteristics of the situation. In order to affirm whether also truly mindless reactions occur (as Nass and Moon, 2000, posit in their ethopoeia approach) we conducted a study on mimicry behavior. Within the experiment we analyzed whether humans reciprocate an agent´s smile. In a between subjects design, 104 participants conducted an eight-minute small talk conversation with an agent that either did not smile, engaged in casual smiles or displayed frequent smiles. Results show that although smiling did not have a distinct impact on the evaluation of the agent, the human interaction partners themselves smiled more frequently when the agent was smiling."

Indeed, many provisions of the bill actually solidified the fraud-inducing system that created the so-called crisis and created perverse incentives for similar actions in the future. In this paper I argue that a ""rhetoric of reform"" served only to provide symbolic cover for negotiations carried on in private, negotiations that accent organizational/institutional actors' capacity to ""mobilize bias"" and manipulate structural/systemic gaps/fissures/contradictions in ways that disadvantage ""masses"" of taxpayers who lack the capacity for strategic outflanking. Implications for the concept of constitutive rhetoric are discussed."

2009-1341,Social and Heuristic Approaches to Credibility Evaluation Online,Cueing Online Credibility,,,,Paper,Social and Heuristic Approaches to Credibility Evaluation Online,Cueing Online Credibility,"The tremendous amount of information available online, coupled with the growing use of the Internet to find it, has resulted in a considerable amount of research on information and source credibility. The vast majority of this research, however, assumes that individuals work in isolation to form credibility opinions, and that people routinely assess information credibility in an effortful and time-consuming manner. Focus group data from 109 participantswith varying levels of Internet expertise, a diversity of demographic characteristics, and residing in 10 different stateswere used to examine these assumptions. Contrary to existing notions, results show that most users rely on others to make credibility assessments, often through the use of group-based tools such as wikis and reputation systems. Results also indicate that rather than systematically processing information, participants routinely invoked cognitive heuristics to evaluate the credibility of information and sources online. These findings are leveraged to suggest a number of avenues for further credibility theorizing, research, and practice."
2009-1342,Social Cognitive Theories of Media Selection,Evolving Perspectives on Media Choice,,,,Paper,Social Cognitive Theories of Media Selection,Evolving Perspectives on Media Choice,"The presentation will introduce the Social Cognitive Theory of Media Selection. Social Cognitive Theory explains human behavior through the mechanisms of enactive and observational learning, self-efficacy, and self-regulation. SCT concepts advance our understanding of the adoption of new media technologies, the diffusion of popular media content, and on-going media selection behavior. The expected outcomes of media behavior, influenced both by observations of the experiences of others and direct (enactive) learning, are powerful predictors of media choices. The self-efficacy concept has deeply influenced research on the adoption and utilization of interactive media. The self-regulatory mechanism offers insight into normative influences through the subprocesses of self-observation, judgmental process, and self-reaction. Recent research examines instances when self-regulation fails, leading to habitual and potentially addictive media selection patterns. The presentation will also compare the SCT to other theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, Uses and Gratifications, and the Diffusion of Innovations paradigm.

Robert LaRose, Ph.D. (University of Southern California, 1979) is a Professor in the Department of Telecommunication, Information Studies, and Media at Michigan State University. His interests are the uses and effects of new media."
2009-1343,Social Contagion: A Communicable Approach To Communication,New Directions in Media Theory,,,,Paper,Social Contagion: A Communicable Approach To Communication,New Directions in Media Theory,"This essay outlines the key dimensions of an epidemiological imaginary to aid development of an alternative conception of the communicable. Special attention is paid to the way this imaginary shapes popular perceptions of the role, working, and effects of communication. I focus on the importance of communication in developing and circulating this imaginary, as well as on discourse theorizing the effects of communication in terms inspired by viral contagion. I then discuss the contribution of Chicago School theorists of social contagion and I recommend intermixing this perspective with the viral and epidemic orientation of scholars inspired by Deleuze and Guattari. Popular theorists of meme dissemination and tipping points are also reconsidered from this more expansive perspective. In conclusion, this essay suggests that critical employment of key dimensions of an epidemiological imaginary can displace several modern assumptions about communicability in media and communication theory."
2009-1344,Social Identity Theory as a Framework for Understanding the Effects of Exposure to Positive Media Images of Self and Other on Intergroup Outcomes,plications of Ingroup and Outgroup Portrayals,,,,Paper,Social Identity Theory as a Framework for Understanding the Effects of Exposure to Positive Media Images of Self and Other on Intergroup Outcomes,Implications of Ingroup and Outgroup Portrayals,"Based on the tenets of social identity theory, the present two-study experimental design was conducted which examined the influence of exposure to positive Latino media exemplars on both ingroup (Latino) and outgroup (White) consumers. Specifically, the impact of exposure on interethnic evaluations as well as perceptions of self and other was evaluated. When taken together, results from Study 1 and Study 2 suggest that although exposure to positive media depictions of Latinos can prompt more favorable evaluations of ingroup and self among Latinos, the same can not necessarily be said for the effects of exposure to affirmative messages on judgments about Latinos among outgroup members (i.e., Whites). Instead, these data indicate that for Whites, ingroup (racial/ethnic) identification is a potent factor in media-related interethnic evaluations."
2009-1345,Social Inequalities and ICT Policies in Developing Countries: A Case of South Africa,Theory and Policy in Communication for Social Change,,,,Paper,Social Inequalities and ICT Policies in Developing Countries: A Case of South Africa,Theory and Policy in Communication for Social Change,"This paper discusses how social disparities and inequalities affect access to ICTs. It analyzes the historical and social contexts of the current state of inequalities in South Africa, and locates access to ICTs within this framework. It then explores how the South African government, through public policies, has attempted to tackle the issue of access to ICTs. The study of some of these policies reveals the shortfall of many access programs. While the intentions of the policies may be proclaimed as reflecting public interests and social good, the tendency to lean towards a neoliberal free market strategy often hampers access programs in many instances. This paper argues that other social forces, such as poverty and social inequalities confront most of the access programs, and render these programs ineffective. It affirms that while access policies are of good intentions, aggressively pursuing policies that address social inequalities, which work in tandem with access programs, are equally essential."
2009-1346,Social Influence in Organizational Discourse Networks,Organizational Discourse: Theory and Research,,,,Paper,Social Influence in Organizational Discourse Networks,Organizational Discourse: Theory and Research,"Social influence in Networks of Practice, defined as geographically dispersed knowledge networks, is expected to emerge out of two sets of factors: (1) structural and (2) relational characteristics. This paper integrates theories on both sets of characteristics, expanding the concept of relational characteristics in terms of actors embeddedness. Starting from full-fledged data about postings on discussion fora within a multinational within the chemical industry, a content analysis was performed to measure 200 aspects of the postings, which could be interpreted by means of a factor analysis as manifestations of four underlying dimensions of embeddedness: organizational, structural and relational embeddedness, and embeddedness in practice. Social influence was measured as correspondence above chance of the language choices of originators and respondents to postings. The paper argues that social influence is the generating mechanism to understand the dynamics of NoPs. Tests at the dyadic level of postings by originators and responding postings revealed that both structural and relational characteristics foster social influence. More specifically structural holes, embeddedness in practice and structural embeddedness were at the heart of social influence. The results seem to indicate that social influence in NoPs is primarily based on actors utilitarian value, generated by both their structural and relational characteristics."
2009-1347,Socially Mediated Authenticity in Public Affairs Communication: DipNote,Communication and Authenticity (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Socially Mediated Authenticity in Public Affairs Communication: DipNote,Communication and Authenticity (Cross Unit),"Social media create the perception of close interaction regardless of time and space. However, they can make it difficult for participants to evaluate the authenticity of interactions in socially mediated spaces. Authenticity is particularly important in the public sphere, and public institutions are increasingly engaging with social media as a means of connecting with constituencies. The United States State Department began its own blog, DipNote, in 2007 (http://blogs.state.gov), with contributors from across the Department and moderated reader comments. DipNote thus offers a constructive entry point for examining authenticity in public affairs communication through social media. This paper describes a study of DipNote using mixed quantitative and qualitative textual analysis of posts and comments, combining social and semantic network methodologies with narrative analysis. The study provides insight into socially mediated public affairs communication, to further understanding of how government agencies negotiate questions of authenticity through their use of communication technology."
2009-1348,"Social Media, Public Intimacies and the Transformation of Contemporary Surveillance","Personal Surveillance, Digitized Identity, and Control in National and Transnational Contexts",,,,Paper,"Social Media, Public Intimacies and the Transformation of Contemporary Surveillance","Personal Surveillance, Digitized Identity, and Control in National and Transnational Contexts","The use of social media such as Facebook and MySpace presupposes the disclosure of private information as a crucial component of ones identity formation. Despite its public nature, this act of subjective expression is introspective in that it requires careful self-evaluation of the overall coherence of such voluntarily-revealed components of ones identity. Paradoxically, the revealed information supposed to communicate the complexity of ones identity ends up becoming the most extensive source of data about individuals thereby producing new forms of surveillance. The new regime of surveillance is characterized by 1) disregard for the contextual integrity of each piece of information and 2) increased uncertainty regarding the criteria used to distinguish between risks and prospects. Consequently, this discriminatory system, often based on automated dataveillance, may assign the individual to a category in a way that not only ignores the complexity of her modular identity but also is virtually impossible to challenge because of its automated nature and its resulting aura of objectivity. This paper recommends an implementation-based privacy protection system that seeks to protect personal information not by limiting its initial disclosure but rather adding accountability to how it is subsequently used."
2009-1349,"Social Movements, Political Goals, and the May 1st Marches: Communicating Protest in Polysemic Media Environments","Protest, Conflict and Social Action",,,,Paper,"Social Movements, Political Goals, and the May 1st Marches: Communicating Protest in Polysemic Media Environments","Protest, Conflict and Social Action","On May 1st, 2006, people engaged in marches, vigils and protests across the United States. In addition to attracting significant media coverage, the actions sparked both celebration and criticism in public commentary on immigration. This paper presents a discourse analysis of 297 front pages from daily newspapers in the United States. Four key themes are identified based on our reading of movement literature leading up to the events and existing research on media coverage of political protest: numbers; economy/economics; policy/rights; and law/order. We then construct linguistic representations of these themes and use keyword in context searches across the front pages to identify general trends, as well as contextually situated analysis at the level of the phrase or clause for each theme. Finally, we draw on mediated discourse from both pro- and anti-immigrant sources, illustrating the polysemous character of language and representation in mediated political discourse."

The Pew Internet and American Life Project (2007) indicated that the majority of teens have contributed to, and are active participants of a social networking environment. With more than 80 million active users on environments such as Facebook (Facebook.com), social networks have an unprecedented power to connect youth. Todays highly coveted youth (defined here as people born after 1980) is made up of multitasking individuals who are known to ignore privacy, opting for an open looking glass into their lives. And, while social network sites such as Facebook have the power to bring youth together, the process of connecting can become counterproductive. Simply, the relationship between friends, perceived network support, and sense of self, can be quadratic. This paper will analyze the positive and negative effects social networks can have on youths' sense of self.

2009-1351,Social Networks and Niche Media Competitive Advantage,cial Networking and Community Building in Appropriations of Media and Communication Technologies,,,,Paper,Social Networks and Niche Media Competitive Advantage,Social Networking and Community Building in Appropriations of Media and Communication Technologies,"Based upon the Resource-Based View and social capital perspective, this research explored how ethnic media, primarily ethnic newspapers, in the United States effectively use and manage their social network resources to gain competitive advantages in local advertising markets. A comparative case study was conducted to examine ethnic medias informal, formal social networks and their values in approaching and maintaining ethnic and non-ethnic mainstream advertisers. The study found that formal social networks were more effective than informal networks in helping ethnic media to develop diverse advertising base of ethnic and non-ethnic advertisers. The stage of company development, the complexity of market and ethnic groups integration with the mainstream society influenced the types of social networks used by ethnic media to attract and maintain advertisers."

Social norms influence behavior through sanctioning. This paper takes a social network approach in understanding the effects of social norms on body image. Integrating theories of social norms, social sanctioning, and strength of weak ties, it proposes that while weak ties are crucial in obtaining new information that helps people resist social sanctioning based on the thin-ideal, strong ties are more effective in changing peoples dieting behaviors. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed."

However, different kinds of disasters (natural or technological, rapid- or slow-onset) may create different stressors and influence types of support needed and available. We explored social support functions in a slow-motion technological disaster. Analyses of focus groups and in-depth interviews indicate that informational support is particularly salient. All community members are affected by the disaster, but specific informational needs (e.g., medical versus financial) vary based on experience with the disasters health consequences (asbestos-related disease; ARD). Experience with ARD also is associated with relatively greater awareness of disaster-related emotional and instrumental support. Results have implications for future research and for institutional and community responses to slow-onset technological disasters."

While some research suggests that the health-related correlates of video game playing among adolescents may continue into adulthood, few studies have explored these relationships specifically among adults. The goal of this study was to distinguish adult video game players from non-players based on personal and environmental factors using a representative sample of adults from the Seattle-Tacoma area (n = 562). Video game playing emerged as a particularly prevalent behavior among the sample (45.1%). A number of personal and environmental determinants distinguished between video game players and non-players, and these factors differed substantially between males and females. Among women, video game players reported significantly greater depression and a lower health status than non-players. Male video game players, on the other hand, reported a significantly high body mass index than non-players. Only reliance on the internet community for social support emerged as common across both female and male respondents. The data at hand illustrate the need for further research with adults, examining health-related gender differences across both video game playing and newer online behaviors (e.g., user-generated content, social networking), that clarifies our understanding of how to most effectively use these digital opportunities for health promotion and prevention endeavors."
2009-1356,"Some Kind of Religious Figure? The Smiths, Catholicism, and Fan Devotion",Media Audiences Between Production and Consumption,,,,Paper,"Some Kind of Religious Figure? The Smiths, Catholicism, and Fan Devotion",Media Audiences Between Production and Consumption,"This paper examines the religious and quasi-religious dimensions of fandom through a case study of the second-generation Irish band The Smiths. Using a combination of ethnography and discourse analysis, I discuss how the Catholic and religious aspects of The Smiths are intertwined and are an essential part of understanding the intense fan appeal of the band. First, drawing upon band interviews, I discuss how The Smiths, and Morrissey in particular, related their experiences of growing up in a Catholic environment. Second, a detailed examination of The Smiths creative output demonstrates that their Catholic upbringing cast a long and lasting shadow over their work. Catholic motifs are in abundance as markers of The Smiths distinctiveness. As well as being white, Northern and working-class, being Catholic was a badge of difference which the band wore on their sleeves. Third, an analysis of a sample of fan discourses reveals that when fans explain their intense relationships with The Smiths they invariably do so through a religious lens. Fan discourses about The Smiths are replete with references to how they have achieved personal redemption and salvation through their devotion to the band and to Morrissey in particular. Cultic discourses are a constant in terms of how both are portrayed."
2009-1357,Some Theoretical Foundations of Critical Media Studies: Karl Marxs Philosophy of Communication,New Directions in Media Theory,,,,Paper,Some Theoretical Foundations of Critical Media Studies: Karl Marxs Philosophy of Communication,New Directions in Media Theory,"Marshall McLuhan and Jean Baudrillard have claimed that Marx had nothing important to say on media, communication, and culture. The approach taken in this paper is different: It is argued that Marx should be considered as the founding father of critical media and communication theories and that his works can be applied today in order to explain contemporary communication phenomena. The works of Karl Marx are systematically reconstructed in order to identify aspects of the media and communication. It is shown that Marx provided important insights for analyzing the role of the media in commodity and ideology production, circulation, and consumption and for discussing the role of alternative media production, circulation, and reception."

Following this, half the participants engaged in a conversation with their friend about the advertisement. Multiple regression analyses showed that these participants reported higher levels of felt risk, perceived norms and intentions than those who did not have the opportunity to discuss the ad  though only if they had listened to the advocacy ad. Of the participants who participated in discussion, a more positive conversational tone was associated with higher scores on all relevant outcomes. Further, in a follow-up questionnaire, participants who had discussed the ad in the ten days after initial exposure were more likely to report positive changes in their intentions. Participants who experienced stronger emotional reactions to the ads were more likely to have discussed them during this interim period, and those exposed to the narrative ad were more likely to report positive conversations. These results are considered in relation to advances in both theory and practice."
2009-1359,Some Uses of Head Nods in Third Position in Talk-in-Interaction,tudies in Language & Social Interaction Research,,,,Paper,Some Uses of Head Nods in Third Position in Talk-in-Interaction,Studies in Language & Social Interaction Research,"Previous research on the use of head nods in talk-in-interaction has demonstrated that they can be used for various interactional purposes by speakers and recipients in different positions in sequences of talk-in-interaction. For example, head nods can function in a range of ways either as initiating actions designed to elicit particular responses from recipients (first position), or as responding actions (second position). In this report, I examine speakers uses of head nods in third position  a sequential position in which an additional turn is often added following a responding actions as a means of moving towards closing the sequence (Schegloff 2007). I begin my examination of the use of head nods in third position by demonstrating the way in which a particular, expansive type of head nod may be used to register a prior utterance as news. I then contrast this first type of third position head nod with a second type, which appears to be designed to register receipt of a prior utterance without treating it as news. Finally, I examine the possibility of a third type of head nod that embodies features of the first two types, and may be designed to register receipt and acknowledgment of dispreferred news. These findings are suggestive of rich complexities in the use of head movements in conjunction with talk-in-interaction, and of the importance of a fine-grained analytic approach for understanding their situated uses."

Rejecting romantic requests present multiple conversational goals and politeness challenges, and this study analyzed the types of linguistic strategies employed in date refusals. Participants composed a message rejecting a date request from a member of the opposite sex. Politeness strategies varied as a function of the relationship between the requester and rejector (acquaintance vs. stranger) and the type of media used (email vs. online dating messaging service). It was found that online daters take advantage of certain features provided by dating website messaging services which allow new ways for romantic refusals that were not previously available in face-to-face communication or earlier forms of computer-mediated communication."

Although a wide pool of research has accumulated examining the effects of the Study Abroad experience on its participants, a clear answer to the following question has not emerged: What are the outcomes of SA for participants? The present study uses a sample of extant Study Abroad research to explain why this question has not been answered. First, Study Abroad is put into context, both historically and academically. Second, the sample of extant research is analyzed to expose methodological problems and general limitations. Lastly, the data gathered from the sample studies is used to develop a model to benefit future research."
2009-1362,"Sound, Affect, and Social Change: The case of hip hop in Japan","Expedient Culture: Negotiating Identity, Materiality, and Otherness in Global Music Cultures",,,,Paper,"Sound, Affect, and Social Change: The case of hip hop in Japan","Expedient Culture: Negotiating Identity, Materiality, and Otherness in Global Music Cultures","This paper adds to the discussion of a question that has received a great deal of attention from scholars of cultural globalization  why is the music of the Black Atlantic so popular in Japan? The answers offered have largely focused on Japanese engagement with reggae, hip hop, and techno as a working-out of political and social issues, such as certain conceptions of race. This paper seeks to supplement such readings by situating the characteristic sounds of hip hop within the complexity of the Japanese soundscape. Hip hops distinctive musical features will be compared to those of dominant Japanese commercial genres including Pop and Visual Kei, longstanding underground traditions including Noise and punk, and older forms such as enka, minyou, and taiko. By bracketing cultural discourses to as great a degree as possible and focusing on the materiality of sound, a new set of motives behind musical globalization will be brought to the forefront."

(TOP Student Paper),Cueing Online Credibility,,,,Paper,Source Cues in Online News: Is Proximate Source More Powerful Than Distal Sources? (TOP Student Paper),Cueing Online Credibility,"With the rise of news aggregators, internet start pages and portal sites, there now exists a chain of sources for any piece of online news. Credible portals sometimes carry news items published by non-credible sources, but do users really factor in all the distal sources or do they rely simply on the proximate source delivering the news? Dual process models in psychology would predict that source is a peripheral cue and only those who are highly involved in the topic of the story would care to dig deeper.
We tested this proposition with a 2 (Issue involvement: High vs. Low) x 2 (Proximal source credibility: High vs. Low) x 2 (Distal source credibility: High vs. Low) full-factorial between-subjects experiment (N = 238) and found that while highly involved readers considered both proximate and distal sources, low-involvement readers were primarily influenced by the proximate source. Implications of these findings are discussed."

After analyzing the main sources and actors in the domestic news coverage, the analysis will examine the (assumed) dominance of U.S. sources and actors in shaping the attribute agendas or frames of this reporting. Special attention will be devoted to the question whether the media in different countries balance the news about the primaries as rigorously as they do in the United States. Do the media opt for balancing the coverage by giving equal voice to political adversaries, or rather by incorporating reactions from political experts, representatives of civil society organizations or ordinary citizens?"
2009-1365,South African Media in Transition,Historical and Contemporary Transitions in Communication Theory and Practice,,,,Paper,South African Media in Transition,Historical and Contemporary Transitions in Communication Theory and Practice,"This paper examines South Africas media from apartheid to the present. Previous research on other transitions from dictorships to democracy has demonstrated that there is a high degree of continuity in media institutions and personnel. These processes best understood as ensuring elite continuity. The apartheid state was different from the communist examples investigated previously, and the paper tests whether the same features are present here. The claims of elite continuity theory are rehearsed and the trajectory of the South African media is investigated. Changes both to the press and broadcasting are reviewed, as are the differences between national and local initiatives. It is demonstrated that many of the predictions of elite continuity theory are sustained, but there are important differences. There is a high degree of institutional continuity but the process of elite renewal is much more marked in the South African case. Both the process and the current state of the mass media reflect the major difference between this transition and earlier cases: the democratization of South Africa was accompanied by very large scale popular mobilizations, which left their mark on the media institutions. The relationship between media and politics is shown to be a variant on previous examples of transition: only with divisions within the governing party emerging is broadcasting becoming overtly factionalised. It is concluded that while major amendments are necessary to account for this experience, the theory of elite continuity remains a valuable guide to the processes of transition."
2009-1366,So You Think You Are Popular? Fear of Isolation Triggers Motivated Perceptions of Consensus,Opinion Perception and Expression,,,,Paper,So You Think You Are Popular? Fear of Isolation Triggers Motivated Perceptions of Consensus,Opinion Perception and Expression,"Based on assumptions from spiral of silence theory and social psychological research, two surveys tested whether fear of isolation would motivate people to perceive higher levels of consensus for their opinions, perhaps through biased exposure to the opinions of similar others. Study 1 demonstrated that participants with a high fear of isolation had greater estimates of consensus than did participants with a low fear of isolation, particularly if they reported that the issue of naturalization was important to them personally. Study 2, in addition to replicating the findings from Study 1, indicated that the relationship between fear of isolation, importance, and perceived consensus was partially mediated by attention to opinion climate. Implications for the consequences of fear of isolation and issue importance, as well as mechanisms behind consensus estimates, are discussed."

Specifically, we focus on the process of first-level and second-level intercandidate agenda setting. A study of information subsidies used by the two majority parties during the 2004 Spanish presidential campaign provides the context for this analysis. Some support was found for first-level and second-level intercandidate relationships. The implications of the findings are discussed."

Assessing Language Preference of Television Viewing for Latino Families,Communication Research in the U.S./Mexican Border Region,"Since the release of the 2000 Census showcasing the growth of the Latino population in the United States, the television industry has been seeking to access this group to sell to advertisers. As a result, there has been an increase in Spanish-language and Latino-themed programming. One of the primary interests in conducting this research is to explore the use of Spanish-language television it the home. There is much assumed about the preference for Spanish-language channels fueled by Nielsen rating numbers, but this research hopes to uncover who in the family is watching and for what purposes. A total of ten families were interviewed and the data reveal that television choice is driven by content not by language."

The introduction of the Internet in mainstream media was framed by a technological imaginary related to the promise of social progress and the decrease of social inequalities (Flichy 2007). Currently the debates on media practice are not settled yet. Copyright infringement, proprietary software, file sharing, new business opportunities and old models of culture industries are promoted or attacked by various interest groups. Their communication of objectives employs several metaphors, images and associations in a rhetoric of social progress. This paper investigates how this rhetoric is constructed in current debates on file sharing, open access and open source software. The paper argues that this symbolic level, as assemblages of metaphors, images and associations is constitutive for the agenda setting, framing and development of technology."
2009-1370,Speech Act Analysis Within Social Network Sites Status Messages,Language of Online Interaction,,,,Paper,Speech Act Analysis Within Social Network Sites Status Messages,Language of Online Interaction,"This research was conducted in an attempt to expand previous research of speech acts and online messaging, by examining how individuals use the status messages of social network sites (specifically Facebook and MySpace) to communicate socially and construct their identity. Seventy-four students' SNS status messages were captured three times daily over fourteen consecutive days. Content analysis of these data revealed that status messages are primarily constructed with expressive speech acts, followed by assertives. Additionally, humor was integrated into almost 20% of status messages. These findings demonstrate differences in how users express themselves in alternate media, and are framed not only to discuss self-presentation in social networks, but also to offer suggestions for theoretical implications for computer-mediated communication research."
2009-1371,Spin Doctors in the Spotlight: Effects of Strategic Metacoverage on Perceptions of Political PR,Top Papers in Public Relations,,,,Paper,Spin Doctors in the Spotlight: Effects of Strategic Metacoverage on Perceptions of Political PR,Top Papers in Public Relations,"Research has amply demonstrated that news media often engage in strategy framing when covering politics. More recently, the notion of strategic press and publicity coverage have been coined to show how political journalism is increasingly focusing on the medias significant role in the game of politics, as well as politicians calculated publicity and public relations efforts in relation to the media. This paper examines the effect of strategic press and publicity coverage on perceptions of political PR once its practitioners and their publicity efforts have become the object of reporting. Drawing on data from two experiments allowing for replication within a single study, the paper shows how political PR professionals have themselves little to gain from becoming part of the story. The implications are considered in the light of the growing significance of media politics, strategic metacoverage, and public cynicism about politics."
2009-1372,Stable Strategies in Environmental Communication: Reaffirming the Change Narrative Throughout the Twentieth Century,Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Stable Strategies in Environmental Communication: Reaffirming the Change Narrative Throughout the Twentieth Century,Political Communication Poster Session,"This presentation will examine several films, released throughout the course of the twentieth century, that address issues related to major environmental concerns around climate change and resource exploitation. I will first briefly visit the importance of myth making, narrative structure, and depoliticization in the communication of political and economic ideology in general before I consider the ways in way each film distinctly employs these strategies. While my interest is primarily in exploring these methodologies in an open way, several conclusions arise from the exercise. Specifically, it seems that even as the message, as it relates to Americans' relationship with their natural environment, changes in dramatic ways, the mode of communication is surprisingly consistent. While the strength and impact of a narrative through-line varies somewhat, the films consistently invoke the exact same myths (Frontierism, the good life) and take incredibly similar approaches to depoliticization, typically by structuring their commentary as reformist and the issue at hand as nothing but a ""problem moment"" to be easily solved. Exploring these issues through a textual analysis of the films, this presentation questions some of the guiding assumptions behind political communication in film and works to destabilize key concepts like reformism, dramatization, and social meaning."

Previous literature indicates the importance of interpersonal relationships for single women, and the influence that some of these relationships have on Japanese women remaining single. Based on standpoint theory, this study attempts to reveal the complex status of Japanese single womens identities and relationships in their own voices. In 2003, thirty always-single Japanese women in Japan were interviewed to examine their interpersonal relationships and identities. The data analysis revealed three themes that relate to the womens interpersonal relationships: family dependency, social support, and relationship issues that prevent marriage. These themes highlighted three important relationships for single Japanese women: family relationships, romantic relationships, and relationships with other women. In particular, the womens accounts revealed the significant impact of family dynamics on their current lifestyles and understanding of marriage. In 2007, twenty of the thirty women were reinterviewed to examine their interpersonal relationships and single identities after four years. While the analysis confirmed the three themes that emerged in the 2003 interviews, they also highlighted three emerging sub-themes that were not apparent in the previous interviews: a shift in family dynamics, position in the family or ie, and committed yet uncommitted relationships. These sub-themes underline an overarching theme acceptance of various natures of relationships and lifestyles, and argue that such acceptance a result of always-single womens self-acceptance, which occurs as they free themselves from the socially imposed role of woman in Japan."

By contrast, my aim is to provide a fuller understanding of the political economy of a local, as well as global mediascape, and to offer a more nuanced analysis of the role of the state in global culture and its transformation, by careful attention to the case study of South Korea. Specifically, I examine discourse politics and pertinent actions by the state in transforming the scene of global and local mediascape, focusing on its discourses, policies, regulations and other actions. I argue that development or social changes are negotiated in a manner more complex than typically acknowledged by globalization scholars (from the left or the right), and in ways that aim to open up inefficient institutions and reflect local social conditions and needs, and sometimes succeed in doing so."
2009-1375,State-Media Relations in an Emerging Democracy: The Paradox of Commercialisation,Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World,,,,Paper,State-Media Relations in an Emerging Democracy: The Paradox of Commercialisation,Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World,"Commercialization is described in Comparing Media Systems, Hallin and Mancinis important 2004 work, as the most powerful force for the homogenization of media systems. Supported by the broader process of secularization, commercialization is understood to weaken the party political media and enhance the highly-capitalized, advertising-funded commercial sector. This was the evidence from the data and the anticipated trajectory of many of the 18 democracies cited in Comparing Media Systems. However, commercialization appears to have a different impact on media-state relations in emerging democracies. Commercialization has, instead, become an opportunity for the state to intervene in the media through the strength of its advertising budget, through the power of its arrangements with provincial or local media and through the weakening of standards and ethical practice that commercialization has brought in its wake. This, at least, has been South Africas experience as its media-state model shifted rapidly in 1994 out of a system of racial chauvinism and into a new era of Constitutional democracy. This paper seeks to interrogate the process of commercialization and its impact on media-state relations as described in Comparing Media Systems using South Africa as a case study. In doing so, it presents a new perspective on the Hallin-Mancini hypothesis through the lens of one of the worlds emerging democracies."
2009-1376,"Static Avatars, Social Presence, and Online Answers",Avatar Power,,,,Paper,"Static Avatars, Social Presence, and Online Answers",Avatar Power,"The ability of static avatars to produce a sense of social presence was evaluated in two content analyses of Yahoo!Answers. Presence was operationalized as engaging in providing help or assistance to the person represented by the avatar, specifically by answering their question. The first, an analysis of 550 questions in a variety of content areas found that questions accompanied by an avatar received significantly more answers than those without an avatar, although avatar presence did not produce significantly better answers. In the second, an analysis of the questions answered by 125 users with varied motives for answering questions, altruistic motives were predictive of a stronger preference for answering questions accompanied by an avatar; other motives were not. Avatar anthropomorphism was found to moderate this effect somewhat. These findings are interpreted as a replication of past experimental findings employing non-experimental methods, adding validity to the claim that avatars produce a sense of social presence in online environments."

Theories such as cultivation, stereotype theory, social learning and social identity theory, all discuss how viewers can internalize and project what they see presented in media, to what they believe to exist in reality. But many of these theories pay less extensive attention to both negative and positive stereotypes, and perceptions of multiple social groups within the same context. Likewise, research ahs less frequently examined the perceptions of marginalized social groups held by African American media viewers. The present study examines the underlying dimensions of stereotype by applying to the stereotype content model (SCM), as it applies to African Americans perceptions of media representations of their own group and of other groups."

This presentation will examine the rhetorical/representational strategies of posted videos and corresponding written comments. In particular I will focus on two interconnected elements: 1) the ways stereotypes are identified, defined, discredited (or reasserted)--and performed; and 2) the ways the video platform becomes a vehicle for star-construction. I will pay specific attention to the presence of individuals of Arab and/or Middle Eastern descent, and will comparatively draw from the taxonomies outlined in Jack Shaheens ground-breaking research on media stereotypes of Arabs. Ultimately, this project will offer a critical take on Jordans appeal to audiences (youth especially) on a national and global level through new media and cyberpresent royalty.

2009-1379,Stereotypes of Americans and Information Source Use in South Korea: A Cognitive Processing Model,Theory Development in International Communication,,,,Paper,Stereotypes of Americans and Information Source Use in South Korea: A Cognitive Processing Model,Theory Development in International Communication,"The present study tested cognitive processing models in explaining stereotypes as the result of the evaluation of information by receivers. This study focused on valence and believability of the information as perceived by the receivers. Consistent with these theories, data from 378 students from 3 South Korean high schools showed that stereotypes are the result of information evaluation rather than the frequency of media use. Media use by itself was not a significant predictor of stereotypes in any of our regression models. Instead, processing variables such as interest, believability and the interaction between valence and believability explained stereotypes. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed."
2009-1380,Stigma Management Communication: A Typology of Strategies Used by Stigmatized Individuals,"-Making and Work Identities: Examining Dirty Work, Stigma, Class, and Media Use",,,,Paper,Stigma Management Communication: A Typology of Strategies Used by Stigmatized Individuals,"Sense-Making and Work Identities: Examining Dirty Work, Stigma, Class, and Media Use","Stigmatization can be constructed based on occupation, health, race, gender, class, and other organizational statuses. Despite increasing interest in the communicative elements of stigmatization, comprehensive theoretical treatment of the individuals management of stigma is lacking. Smiths (2007a) recent work models stigma communication, focusing on the discursive creation and maintenance of stigma. This research opens the door for further addressing the stigmatized persons management of stigmatization, referred to here as stigma management communication. Existing research considering how stigmatized individuals manage such communication comes from social psychology, sociology, communication, and business and management scholars and offers overlapping and incomplete sets of categories rather than a comprehensive typology of stigma management strategies. This essay crosses disciplinary boundaries to assess and combine research on stigma management from these areas, including theorizing on image repair, in order to present a comprehensive, yet exploratory theory of stigma management communication. It also addresses theoretical issues of stigma type, determination of stigma status, and the (non)permanence of stigmatization."

Situating Watsons work against the backdrop of professionalized news, I argue that it was not merely the emerging technologies which led to the reproduction of the noble and ignoble savage binary in the popular press, but the internal logics of such discursive formations which made them so easily reproduced. In addition, I suggest that while scholars have focused a great deal of attention on hard news stories and the ideal of objectivity, we can learn more by exploring the productivity of entertaining newspaper content such as Watsons stories. Watson was an agent in reproducing the standards of his discipline, and looking to his work can tell us a great deal about the exigency of his field as journalism was becoming professionalized. I argue that while Watsons stories were considered entertaining, he and others in his field believed such content served an important educational function; in particular, Watson believed he was correcting negative misconceptions about American Indian people through the noble savage identity construct."

Using survey data collected by Korea Research Center and The Institute for Korean Election Studies, it found that the sizeable portion of third candidate supporters changed their voting decision during the election period. Strategic voting models indicated that voters casted their ballots for the candidate with the expectation about losing possibility of their preferred candidates and negative feeling about winning candidates. Mass media had a significant effect on early swinging voters, but did not have an effect on last minute swinging voters."

These projects were part of an effort to build research collaborations between the NCI's Cancer Information Service (CIS) and regional cancer control researchers to test new approaches for enhancing online cancer communication with under-served communities. By working in concert with each of the Digital Divide Pilot Projects, the NCI hoped to learn how to better reach diverse and under-served audiences of people who need relevant health information and support. These demonstration research projects suggested effective new strategies for using communication technologies to educate under-served populations with limited health literacy about cancer prevention, control, and care."

The process of reconciliation of knowledge claims is very public because each article has a connected talk page, where users are able to discuss edits, make comments and debate various aspects of the article. Wikipedia attempts to produce content with a neutral point of view (NPOV) and editors often agree on the facts because sufficient sources (especially mainstream media) provide corroboration. Nonetheless many debates arise and the entire process is rife with value judgments. To explore the negotiation of truth in Wikipedia, two controversial and active articles were selected: Iraq War and George W. Bush. This analysis shows Wikipedia editors to be constantly grappling with such problems as finding an authorial voice and perspective that will be accepted by others as neutral and dealing with the values that always lurk just below the surface on any discussion of the facts."
2009-1387,Structural/Formal Features of Narrative,Keywords in Information Systems: Narrative (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,Structural/Formal Features of Narrative,Keywords in Information Systems: Narrative (High Density),"Transportation was developed by Green and Brock (2002, 2006) as a way to operationalize how much like a narrative a story is---if the story is a lot like a narrative it should be highly transporting. The measure they developed is called transportation. Transportation is highly dependent on the interaction between the reader and the text and is not, therefore, truly a measure of the features underlying the text. There are a number of questions that most likely reflect the structural or formal features of the story within the transportation scale and many others may be related to the ability of the reader to empathize or identify with characters, or to visualize information that may be reflected in stories that are high in transportation. A structural or formal feature of a story is the scaffolding on which the content of the story rests including things like how sequential the story is and how much context is provided. This paper presents data collected from a set of preliminary studies and proposes a study designed to assess the effectiveness of a set of formal feature scales related to the structure of the story. Formal feature scale effectiveness is being operationalized such that stories that are high in narrative structure should have higher scores on belief change on controversial issues in the direction of the story, forced choice recognition, cued recall and free recall scores. Findings from preliminary research suggest that stories high in structure produce higher scores on a cued recall task."

Utilizing a construct called family communication standard (FCS), families were classified into three distinctive profiles of communicative orientations. Similarly, victims' disclosure patterns were explored through a latent class analysis. Thus identified FCS profile and disclosure patterns were structurally associated with each other via victims' efficacy perceptions. This FCS-efficacy-disclosure linkage was discussed with reference to previous findings on parental underestimation of prevalence of bullying and victimized individuals' coping process. Additionally, the disclosure patterns were found to differentiate victims by their post-bullying adjustment levels such that those who disclosed their experience to parents, best friend, and/or teacher showed more enhanced levels of subjective well-being than their undisclosed counterparts. Limitations of this study and future directions for the research on bullying were also discussed."
2009-1389,Structure and Professional Role of Journalism in Transformation,ponsored by the German Communication Association: Stability and Change in German Journalism,,,,Paper,Structure and Professional Role of Journalism in Transformation,Session Sponsored by the German Communication Association: Stability and Change in German Journalism,"Journalism in Germany is a nationwide representative survey of German journalists, which was
carried out in 1993 and 2005 to measure the structural and functional development of German journalism.
Both stability and change can be inferred from the following results:
1. The number of German journalists has significantly decreased, which is completely due to the
reduction of freelancers (deprofessionalization).
2. The emergence of internet journalism and the increase of the number of broadcast and magazine
journalists correspond with the decrease of newspaper journalists (structural shift).
3. Objective reporting is still the central role of journalism, other professional roles, such as service-
oriented journalism and entertaining have not increased in acceptance (functional stabilization).
4. Still, German journalists estimate the influences within newsrooms stronger than the external
influences but the perceived influences of the audience have increased (self-reference).
5. German journalists daily effort in gaining information has decreased significantly for the benefit
of technical or organizing tasks (bureaucratization)."
2009-1390,Structured Polysemy of the Post: Watching Political Humor on a Social Network,Barack Obama and Popular Communication: The Rise of Politics of the Popular,,,,Paper,Structured Polysemy of the Post: Watching Political Humor on a Social Network,Barack Obama and Popular Communication: The Rise of Politics of the Popular,"In the 2008 election, the candidates spent record amounts on television advertising, despite viral videos and ""YouTube moments"" arguably having eclipsed 30-second spots as more influential forms of political communication. When commentators speculated about the most critical moments in debates or on the campaign trail, it wasn¹t because the other side would seize upon them for ads. Rather, it was how those moments might be de/re-contextualized by media producers from across the political spectrum, many of whom would be looking to make people laugh, first, and think, second. It is not the production, but the distribution and exhibition of these videos on social network sites like Facebook and MySpace that, I think, is most in need of theorization. At a time when shows like Saturday Night Live and the Daily Show are chopped into pieces for online distribution, when there¹s a baby-boom of mash-up video artists, and short, funny political videos spread like wildfire, it¹s time to consider the structured polysemy of the post. How does watching political humor on social network sites differ from other viewing contexts?

The goal is to point out any major stylistic differences in the new coverage of the primaries found in the United States and in the other 21 nations included in this study. The focus of the analysis will be on the level of conflict and sensationalism found in the domestic and foreign news coverage of the primaries. To investigate these research questions, the paper will examine the use of the following key journalistic elements in the domestic and foreign coverage of the primaries: (1) interviews, (2) live/pre-recorded reports, (3) quotes, (4) visual materials, (5) archive materials, (6) background music, (7) use of time shift, (8) the number of original (non-US) news reports in the foreign coverage, and (9) the degree of political conflict and sensationalism."

It was regarded as offering a lot of promise in a continent where most countries experiences of independence were characterized by one party dictatorships, collapsing economies and civil strife. This study intends to examine the coverage of the February 2000 constitutional referendum and June 2000 parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe in order to understand the discourse of post colonial politics in terms of the concept of democracy how it was portrayed through these events. The research interrogates the competing perspectives between ruling party discourse highlighted in government controlled newspapers, and opposition political parties discourse in privately owned newspapers. During the period under study, the ruling party focused more on the need to economically empower people as a sign of political independence; the opposition emphasized the need for political freedom in order to entrench democracy. This created a bifurcated notion of democracy. An analysis of discourses in these two different newspapers will help in illuminating how independence and democracy have been understood within Zimbabwe specifically and post colonial Africa generally. It is also important to position media discourse on independence and democracy within the large historical context of post colonial struggles in Africa. The goal is to bring out how different groups struggle with challenges of post colonial experiences to create new meaning."

Developing effective prevention campaigns designed to lessen or avert the risks associated with alcohol consumption entails understanding how students perceive harmful consequences as well as the ways they protect themselves while drinking. This study used survey research to determine what undergraduate students perceived to be the most severe alcohol-related harms and the protective behaviors that they thought would be effective at averting those harms. Results showed that students saw forced sex as the most severe alcohol-related harm, and the most commonly described protective behavior was personal responsibility. Implications of these findings for campus-focused health communication strategists and directions for future research are discussed."

Canadian youth in particular are heavy users of information communication technology, and statistics gathered by the Media Awareness Network show that their use of communication tools is increasing (Media Awareness Network, 2005b). This paper reports on student perceptions of broadband visual communication technology in the context of two Diet and Body Image Virtual Classroom sessions held April and November, 2007. On each occasion these two sessions connected more than five hundred students in schools distributed across Canada through the use of videoconferencing as well as the BVCam - a video recording service based on the H.323 protocol for videoconferencing on IP networks (Authors, 2008a). While the students in this study regarded video and videoconferencing as important tools for communication and learning they also mentioned several barriers to the use of broadband visual communication in the classroom. The biggest challenge identified in this study was the students perceptions of video and videoconferencing. Preconceived notions of broadband technology affected the way in which students envisioned and used the technology in the Virtual Classroom. This paper explores the students responses to videoconferencing and video and suggests ways in which broadband tools can more effectively meet the pedagogical objectives of the Virtual Classroom."

Such interactions draw upon ongoing globalizational structures that operate within cinematic public spheres. Through SMMs Micro-Moment Timeline informed interview techniques, we have been able to illuminate highly complex and hybridizing processes that challenge received theory regarding the nature of transnationalism in the production and consumption of Hindi film. Preliminary findings will be discussed in the paper."

Rather, I provide evidence from my own research in the Middle East that popular communication in the non-West is a critical avenue and catalyst for the elaboration of locally meaningful versions of modernity. This means, first and foremost, that popular communication is a privileged site of the formation and contestation of the political in contexts that lack working institutional arrangements that enable reasonably wide public participation.

Despite this, we know surprisingly little about the production, circulation, and consumption of sexually-oriented products and commercialized forms of sexuality. Communication scholars in particular, I argue, have lagged behind researchers in other disciplines when it comes to conducting empirically-driven studies of sexual commerce. Yet the relationship between sexuality and marketplace culture, including sexual retail, strip clubs, brothel prostitution, pornography, and adult industry trade shows, for example, is rife with questions of interest to communication scholarsquestions about sexual representation, discourse, and the production and circulation of cultural meanings, identities and practices. This presentation outlines what a communication studies framework, one that positions the sex industry as a culture industry, can bring to studies of sexual commerce and the broader field of sexuality studies."

In-depth patient interviews were performed using an event-ordering interview technique, informed in part by Sense-Making Methodologys time-line approach. Results raised the importance of studying the patient-in-context, enabling the identification of hierarchical information needs prioritized according to salient goals, and situational circumstances at given points in time. The aim of the research is to assist health professionals to be more effective in their information provision activities."

On the one hand, an ideology of news coverage promotes the notion that cameras produce mechanical records of people and events, thereby bringing a veridical experience of the world to viewers and readers. On the other hand, media research and analysis shows that news images routinely fall short of representing photographed subject matter in faithful or complete ways. In fact, several studies suggest that rather than reveal unique or previously unseen views and information as part of a process of journalistic detection and discovery, news images most often simply symbolize or recapitulate the themes and motifs of written and spoken reports. Moreover, studies indicate that the visual illustration of news stories comprises a narrow symbolic repertoire. The range of visual representation found in news coverage of world events such as the invasion of Iraq, for example, is narrow and repetitive, presenting subjects and perspectives that serve pre-existing agendas. It would be most accurate to say that these news images operate as familiar and readily recognized motifs, as key visuals that mark topics, prompt thematic narratives, symbolize beliefs, or frame political issues. This visually illustrated presentation provides a review of research on news images to argue that journalism practices across media (print, television, and the web) routinely employ reflection theories of visual representation to promote the authority of reality claims, while simultaneously presenting viewer/readers with highly codified visual signs marking repetitive news narratives."

Plus or Minus 2,The Power of News Images: Multidisciplinary Perspectives (Cross Unit),"The title of this presentation mixes two well-known sayings: one a proverbial statement about the immense amount of information that a single visual can succinctly portray, the other a reference to George Miller's statement about the limited nature of human cognitive processing capacity. This papers goal will be to trace the way television visuals have been conceptualized within a limited-capacity model of media processing--culminating with data from recent experiments where a new coding scheme quantifies the relative amount of information presented by each visual and furthermore demonstrates that the ability to successfully encode visuals depends upon an interaction between the frequency with which the images change and the complexity of the information introduced by those visual changes."
2009-1404,Studying Visuals From a Political Communication Perspective: The Framing and Agenda-Setting Effects of News Images.,The Power of News Images: Multidisciplinary Perspectives (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Studying Visuals From a Political Communication Perspective: The Framing and Agenda-Setting Effects of News Images.,The Power of News Images: Multidisciplinary Perspectives (Cross Unit),"The ability of visuals to frame media messages is not as well understood as framing through words, yet, in some cases, visual framing may actually matter more than verbal framing. For example, everyone knows the anecdotal evidence of the impact of images from Hurricane Katrina or September 11. More ordinary news events include the stereotypical visuals laced with racial and gender stereotypes that would never pass newsroom muster if communicated in words. In these cases, it is more than a saying that pictures show what words could never convey. This paper explores how visual images contribute to framing in the news, and the evolution of that exploration into the realm of agenda setting, in particular, the second level. It has been established that visuals have agenda-setting effects, for example, the size of a photograph influences people's assessment of an issue's importance, with larger photographs leading to perceptions of more importance. New research concerns itself with second-level agenda-setting by visual images. For instance, how visual images influence people's affective impressions, emotions and assessment of personality and character traits of people in the news."

In turn, emotions are key to arousing attention and activating thinking and memory because they release stimulants into the bloodstream that sensitize perceptions and heighten their impact. Unless political stories are framed audio-visually to produce emotional arousal, most are ignored because they are intrinsically uninteresting and uninvolving for average audiences. The strongest arousal stimuli involve core emotions like pride and hope or anger and fear. Political stories about war, threats to personal economic security, violent crime and its victims, widespread suffering especially among children, provide illustrations. Poignant emotional events are long-lasting in the public's collective memories. The desperate victims hurtling themselves from the burning and collapsing Twin Towers on September 11th, 2001, or the funeral of a young, martyred president, Jack Kennedy, will not be forgotten for many decades, especially because news media periodically re-broadcast the audio-visual footage of such wrenching incidents. Repetitions refresh memory traces making recall easier. Diverse fields like neuro-science, social science and the realms of theater, literature, and music, provide ample evidence that human beliefs and actions are formed and changed through viewing emotional political scenarios. My paper traces the psychological processes that lead from exposure to audio-visuals to emotional arousal to political action."

Nevertheless, the ""viscom"" perspective on understanding visual images can be defined by an attempt to understand the role of the picture, whatever its form, modality, or expression in how humans make sense of the world around them whereby the ""image"" is both an independent and dependant variable. This perspective is an ancient one, going back at least to the first medium, the cave paintings of the Upper Paleolithic, through the most modern digital online imagery. My presentation will review the many viscom approaches to studying images and offer a unified theory of how they connect and can be built upon by researchers interested in practically any question related to pictures and society."

A Longitudinal Field Study on the Appropriation of Mobile Television,"Technology Diffusion at Home, Work, and Community","With a new generation of improved, broadcast-based mobile TV standards, the combination between mobile telephony and television promises to turn into a success story soon. In this situation, mobile carriers and audiovisual media are betting enormous investments on new technologies such as Digital Video Broadcasting  Handheld (DVB-H), Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) and MediaFLO to override technical barriers which still seem to retard the evolution. The study presented contributes to a reflection on future uses of mobile TV by considering the appropriation of an existing service. Theoretically, it draws on a circular model of mobile phone appropriation integrating elements from different approaches in adoption and appropriation research. To observe the process of mobile TV appropriation in real time, groups of users were equipped with third generation mobile telephones over a three months period, and accompanied through guided interviews and WAP-based online questionnaires based on the experience sampling method."
2009-1408,Subaltern Organizing: Resisting Master Narrative of Development,tudies in Organizational Resistance,,,,Paper,Subaltern Organizing: Resisting Master Narrative of Development,Studies in Organizational Resistance,"There is a paucity of scholarship on resistance that exists outside US-European academia, explored in non-Western contexts, and engaged with the subaltern contexts where resistive politics has particularly critical ramifications. Utilizing several epistemological pursuits and methodological tools, research on resistive politics has engaged with issues related to micro and macro-level interplays of power, control and domination; in exploring these elements, much of this research has taken for granted the West-centric locales within which resistance has been articulated. Furthermore, they have often taken resistance beyond the realm of culture and culturally situated politics to theorize about universalities in resistive politics as if resistance exists in an a-cultural vacuum. In this project, we seek to understand the organizing processes of resistance in a subaltern sector as it challenges the master narratives of development articulated in the modernist framework. Through the case study of farmer activism in Singur in India that opposed the construction of a car manufacturing plant by displacing farmers from their land, this project engages with possibilities for dialoguing with alternative narratives of development that challenge West-centric meta narratives. Political economy of land in Singur gets established as an autonomous economy that exists parallel to the domain of neo-liberalism. Rupturing Eurocentric notions, land becomes a cultural symbol for organizing resistance in Singur."

When research describes strategic-instrumental (inter)actions, SMM provides aspirational narratives of communicating subjects hoping to live together, discuss matters with each other, and realize autonomy  all critical-theoretical requirements for identity, consent, and authentic interpretation. SMM then contributes knowledge of systematic suppressions of communicative action."

How News Content Can Reduce Political Cynicism,"Cynicism, Efficacy, and Social Capital","This article investigates the impact of strategic and substantive news on political cynicism for the general public and for younger people in particular (18  34 years old). While studies on the supposed negative impact of strategic news yielded mixed results, the possible positive impact of substantive news was not studied extensively. This article draws on a national voter panel survey (N=801) conducted before and after the Dutch 2006 elections and a content analysis of television and newspaper items during the campaign period. Contra¬ry to what we expected, we did not find an effect of strategic news on political cynicism. For the whole population, we find a weak reduction of political cynicism from exposure to sub¬stantive news. Among younger voters however, substantive news had a clear negative effect on political cynicism. This suggests that young adults experience a process of secondary socialization, in which exposure to substantive news may reverse the spiral of cynicism."
2009-1411,Successful Online Public Relations Message Conveyance: The Role of User Control in Websites,and Out of Control,,,,Paper,Successful Online Public Relations Message Conveyance: The Role of User Control in Websites,In and Out of Control,"The purpose of this study was to propose the user control model as one of the most effective methods to successfully convey public relations messages in a web-based environment. The user control model suggests systematic application methods as a way of increasing interactivity. User control was defined by three elements, participation, flexibility, and personalization. Three websites were designed with high, medium, and low user control levels, and 183 participants were assigned one of three websites to explore. The results of an ANOVA and MANOVA revealed that a website with high levels of user control succeeded in creating a positive evaluation of the website and the organization. However, the analysis also revealed that levels of high user control failed to change peoples behaviors, such as supporting the organizations mission and donating money. The findings suggest that user control is an essential web communication factor for creating a pleasant web experience, improved comprehension, and a positive attitude toward the organization."

It posits that the films mind-bogging juxtapositions, irrational arrangements, and ridiculous combinations parallel Ben Highmores notion of collage practice whose chief purpose it is to use the combined techniques of mixing and remixing extant materials and resources so as to foster new ways of seeing the familiar and the known. It concurrently postulates that Tsuis film-collages highlight accents of difference that speak to and of his flexible citizenship in the transnational arena of cultural production. These accents simultaneously accentuate corresponding issues of physical estrangement, cultural displacement and geographical dislocation consequent to colonialism, diaspora and globalization. They both reflect and drive the transnational sensibilities of Tsuis film-collages, cutting a swathe with Hamid Nacifys notion of accented cinema in which conflicting themes about homelands, borderlands and diasporalands abound. This postulation necessarily challenges the contentions that Tsuis films are very Chinese indeed, referring as they do to Chinese history and culture, a Chinese environment, and that [t]he role of Tsuis nationalism, therefore, is mainly to signify his Chineseness."

First, its meta-theoretic assumptions provide the basis for a critique of the treatment of surveillance subjects in the relevant literature. Specifically, SMM suggests the relevant academic and policy narratives provide highly simplified and distorted accounts of how citizens experience and respond to surveillance. Second, extrapolating from SMMs meta-theoretical premises, a research protocol can be designed to enter the lives and worlds of differently situated citizens so they can speak on their own terms about their experiences in various surveillance settings."

From biometric technologies to backscatter cameras, industry proponents of new technologies claim that their products offer up neutral, objective ways of rendering the human body transparent. Drawing on Ingrid Richardson's analysis of contemporary desires to make bodily interiors perceptible as part of a post-9/11 project aimed at total visibility, this presentation problematizes the claim that security technologies ""see"" the body in neutral or objective ways. Instead, through an analysis of a number of security technologies, including infra-red cameras and backscatter x-ray machines, I aim to challenge industry narratives that claim that these new technologies are freed from the persistent forms of systemic discrimination that plague real life. Instead, this presentation examines the ways in which new surveillance technologies remain tied to racialized, gendered, and classed ways of visualizing the body."

This is a paper about the U.S. only to the extent that (a) the crises under discussion are heavily influenced by U.S. events, discourses, and legal acts; and (b) the U.S. state has a vested interest and history of interference in Canadian security matters, which filter down into the everyday lives of residents in major Canadian cities in particular.

Studies examining the communicative function of such cues are few in number, but those that exist have focused heavily on what sexually dimorphic facial features convey to observers. In spite of this singular focus, the face is not alone in its ability to reveal underlying sexual dimorphism - often equated with masculinity/femininity - that ultimately influences perceived attractiveness. This talk will present research that suggests that the bodys shape and motion are equally potent cues for perceived attractiveness, in part because these cues reliably convey sex category membership to observers. Implications for communication science will be discussed."

Consequently only analyzing the adoption or rejection of this innovation cluster is no longer sufficient but one has to examine its integration into the users everyday lives. This process can be described by the MPA-model by Wirth, von Pape, & Karnowski (2008). One main aspect of this model is meta-communication, i.e. communication about the innovation. The present study examines this meta-communication by integrating aspects from social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) in order to identify the potential influence of mass-media content on the individual appropriation process.
To do so we conducted a content analysis of 944 episodes of five TV-serials first aired in Germany between 1996 and 2006 to identify and describe the (fictional) patterns of mobile phone appropriation displayed in TV-serials."
2009-1419,Tabloidization and Coverage of Domestic Violence in Hong Kong Newspapers,Titillating News,,,,Paper,Tabloidization and Coverage of Domestic Violence in Hong Kong Newspapers,Titillating News,"This paper, based on content analysis of four newspapers in Hong Kong, explores how tabloidized media represent domestic violence and the kind of framing strategies they used to attribute responsibility. The data for the study consists of 77 articles concerning the Tin Shui Wai tragedy, where a mother committed suicide after killing her daughter and son, during October 2007.
Tabloidization can be viewed as a media phenomenon involving the revision of newspaper driven by reader preferences and commercial requirements (Esser, 1999.) It is usually manifested in the volume of news content, the size of headline fonts, the use of photographs and illustrations (Malovic, 1995.) The findings suggest that tabloid-style reporting is used in covering the case of domestic violence, but the newspapers in Hong Kong also produce investigative and in-depth reports. While the four newspapers demonstrate different degree of tabloidization, the more tabloid-style news articles are found to be more likely in attributing responsibility to individuals."

Path analyses show that conversations about blood donation are central to voluntary blood donation efforts. The direct effects of conversation on past and future voluntary blood donation are significant, and most importantly, talk mediates the contribution of other variables in the model including media and pro civic behaviors. Differences with a model predicting blood donation for emergencies are discussed. A talk-centered model of blood donation is proposed and its implications assessed for future blood collection programs."

Specifically, this project was designed to study how culture affects individuals impressions of schizophrenia and how culture and impressions of schizophrenia affect individuals perceptions of appropriate tactics of disclosing a information about schizophrenia. Approximately 350 students from China and the US responded to a survey about impressions of schizophrenia and preferred communication tactics for disclosing a schizophrenia diagnosis. Overall, the results of this study indicate that perceptions of schizophrenia differed based on the participants country of origin and perceptions of schizophrenia."

Participants (N=266) were randomly assigned to have a conversation about exercise, student-related activities or no conversation prior to exposure to ads promoting daily moderate exercise. The main hypothesis in the study was that talking about past exercise behaviors would increase the salience of control beliefs, which would result in a significantly stronger perceived behavioral controlbehavioral intention relation. This hypothesis was supported. Additionally, there was a significant shift in the strength of the normbehavioral intention, with subjective norms predicting intention to exercise only in the no conversation condition. The paper discusses the theoretical implications of the finding, as well as the implications for planners of mass media health campaigns."
2009-1423,Targeted Bodies,Body Talk (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Targeted Bodies,Body Talk (Cross Unit),"On the face of it, health communication campaigns change health behaviors on a mass scale to improve public health. Populations are targeted, surveys are administrated, media exposure is tested, and grants are extended. On paper, this is governmentality in action: organizing and disciplining bodies. In this presentation, I challenge the simplicity of this diagnosis by reading across the boundaries of sub-disciplines in our field.

Drawing on my experiences as an analyst for an adolescent sexual health campaign, I explore the contradictions of doing social research at a distance, viewing the process of embodiment as a strategic imaginary deployed in pursuit of professional goals. The bodies of the subjects targeted by a campaign are abstracted across multiple dimensions; by offering an ethnography of scholarly efforts to imagine and change these bodies I hope to open up opportunities for critical discussion of the ontology of health promotion and its relationship to the real."

SMM has been applied as a universal approach that emphasizes how non-expert and expert worlds can interconnect outside the impositional constraints of noun-based hierarchical domain-oriented expertise. In SMM, this kind of communicative intersection is posited as essential to move education from mere transmission to more genuine communication in which the world views of both non-expert and expert, lived experience and expertise matter. Application contexts have involved some 80 classroom settings over a 20 year period with both undergraduate and graduate students."

It tested the effects of both technology and non-technology factors on podcast adoption and use. The finding confirmed the impact of diminishing variation of technology advantage on technology adoption and use. While perceived attributes and technology efficacy were still influencing some aspects of adoption and use of podcast, non-technology factors perceived value of information and perceived quality of information were both stronger predictors on years of podcast use and likelihood of podcast use than perceived attributes of podcast and technology efficacy. Social utility of podcast use was not found to have any effect on podcast use and likelihood of podcast use."

The encounter with technology in Iran has inevitably been entangled with an encounter with the West and modernity. For some religious figures, Western technological progress has been a continuation of medieval Islamic sciences. Although intellectuals view modernity with ambivalence, their outlook on technology remains utilitarian in their discourse of authenticity as a response to Occidentosis or in their philosophical response to technology. In the popular discourse of technology, in the context of a consumerist ethos where technology is embraced without reserve, we find less ambivalence toward technology but a paradoxical relationship to it nonetheless."

In this article, we research the relationship between parental mediation to protect their teenage childrens privacy online and the behavior by teenagers in online disclosure of personal information. Using secondary data from a survey of a representative sample of 935 teenagers and their parents, our analysis shows the degree parents mediate their teen childrens Internet usage predicted the extent to which the teens disclose their personal information on social networking sites. Parents of younger teens practiced more mediation to control teens Internet usage compared to parents of older teens. In analyzing predictors of the level of parental mediation, the significant predictors were demographic characteristics of teens and parents, specifically teens age, female gender and family income, while parental attitudes toward new communication technology was not significant. The studys implications for parents, educators and policymakers are discussed, with suggestions for future research."
2009-1428,Teens and Communication Technology: The Coconstruction of Privacy and Friendship in Mediated Communication,Online Privacy,,,,Paper,Teens and Communication Technology: The Coconstruction of Privacy and Friendship in Mediated Communication,Online Privacy,"Teenagers are increasingly using communication technologies to make and maintain friendships. Despite considerable attention from the research community, there are two notable gaps in the literature on privacy and friendship in mediated communication that this paper seeks to fill. First, most studies consider the twin goals of online privacy and friendship in opposition to each other. Second, most studies focus on just one communication technology or application in isolation. In this paper, we take a more comprehensive approach, considering mediated privacy and friendship in conjunction, and considering the ecosystems of technologies that teens use to support their relationships. Our results from a series of semi-structured interviews with teenagers, aged 13-17, suggest that teens understandings of privacy and friendship in mediated communication are negotiated with respect to one another, rather than in opposition. In addition, teens apply conceptions of privacy not to individual technologies, but rather to ecosystems of technologies that they use to support different types of friendships."
2009-1429,"Telecommunications Reforms, the State, and Markets: A Comparative Case of Mobile Telephony in India and China",Liberalization and Policy Reform: International Perspectives,,,,Paper,"Telecommunications Reforms, the State, and Markets: A Comparative Case of Mobile Telephony in India and China",Liberalization and Policy Reform: International Perspectives,"Insofar as a nations telecommunications reforms are concerned, do the state and markets necessarily play opposite roles in the reform processes? China and India, as two fast growing economies, have experienced rapid growth in their telecommunications in the last two decades. Behind the two nations similar growth paths in mobile telephony, China and India adopted different policy approaches to their telecommunications development. To de-monopolize mobile telephony in the early 1990s, China opted for a state-led telecommunications system with managed competition through creating a second state-owned operator to participate in markets. On the other hand, India had aimed at a more liberalized telecommunications market through a licensing policy that would introduce multiple private operators into the market. These two seemingly contradicting mechanisms (Chinas state-led and Indias market-led approaches), nevertheless, have respectively helped the two nations to achieve the same rate of rapid growth in mobile teledensity. This paper explores how state interventions and market forces have concurrently contributed to each of the two nations development in mobile telephony, though their policies are quite different. The discussion shows that the two nations reforms were not driven either by the states active participation in the sector or withdrawal from the industry."

Given the historical nature of the political-economic transitions of these societies, such concentrations are understandable, but they also obscure equally significant transitions in popular media culture. Taking the case of reality television in Hungary, which acceded to the European Union on 2004, this presentation considers how the genreas a European importserved as a vehicle for thinking through the tensions between Eastern and Western identities, capitalism and socialism, and pre-modern and post-modern forces in Hungarian society. The research for the presentation comes from program viewings, newspaper articles, and online fan sites conducted in the fall of 2003 and spring of 2004, when the reality television craze first hit Hungary."

In this paper, by examining a televisual example of ""new millennium 'mulatta'"" demi-tragedy, I consider how the limitations and privileges of claiming a mixed-race African American identity are represented in contemporary media culture. Beals' portrayal of Bette, who is constantly marked by her punishment, lays bare the ideologies surrounding the twenty-first century tragic mulatta and illustrates that while the mixed-race Black subject might exhibit racial flexibility, she is ultimately, always a tragic mulatta."

A posttest control-only experimental design is used. Two experimental conditions are used to replicate the findings.

To examine the unique associations of child and household television (TV) exposure with aggressive behavior among 3 year olds while controlling for risk and protective factors for aggression previously identified in the literature and family demographic characteristics.
Methods:
The Fragile Families and Child Well-being study (FFCWS) is a longitudinal study collecting data from parents of children born between 1998 and 2000 from 20 cities which oversampled unmarried parents. Mothers who completed the 36-Month In-Home Survey and met inclusion criteria were included (n=3,061). Childhood aggression was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist/2-3. Child and household TV exposure were the primary explanatory variables of interest. Risk factors included maternal health, maternal parenting factors, maternal experience with violence, and neighborhood disorder. Multivariate linear regression models were run in order to examine associations between TV exposure and childhood aggression, while accounting for other potential explanatory variables and covariates.
Results:
Direct child TV exposure and household TV exposure each were associated with childhood aggression after accounting for a multitude ofvarious parent, family, neighborhood, and demographic characteristics. However, when child and household TV exposure were both included in the same model, only the latter remained significantly associated with aggressive behavior.
Conclusions:
Three-year old children living in households with higher than average TV use are at increased risk for exhibiting aggressive behavior. Further research is essential in order to advance the understanding of this linkage and to determine whether pediatric recommendations concerning TV use among young children may want to consider suggesting limits for household TV use."
2009-1434,Television Through Internet: Copyrights vs. Cultural Democracy,Critical and Cultural Perspectives on ICTs,,,,Paper,Television Through Internet: Copyrights vs. Cultural Democracy,Critical and Cultural Perspectives on ICTs,"In summer 2006 a small Finnish company called TVkaista started a service that enabled anybody to have an access to all Finnish FTA television channels via an internet broadband connection. As the service is based on recorded broadcasts, the access to programmes is delayed after the original transmission has expired. The service claims to avoid copyright breach by maintaining to offer only a digital recorder to users, who then make the actual act of recording by themselves.

Because of complaints by major Finnish television companies, the service was off-line between late 2006 and summer 2007. From autumn 2007 it has been running, however, without interferences. In this paper, the TVkaista service will be discussed from three standpoints:
1) From the legal point of view. TVkaista seems clearly to challenge the present nationally restricted copyright regime, and this might cause further legal consequences.
2) From a cultural democracy viewpoint. TVkaista offers unique digital archive services and in this sense it can be assessed as producing public services. Additionally, it gives an open access to Finnish television to all Finnish ex-patriots around the globe who otherwise would not have access to such services.
3) Form the European public sphere perspective. It might be argued that as the service promotes transnational distribution of linguistically and culturally restricted contents, it effectively supports cultural and social fragmentation. Also an opposite argument is possible: by challenging nationally restricted copyright regimes in Europe the TVkaista-type of service is opening the way to a cosmopolitan socio-cultural public space."

Recent research has demonstrated the importance of political knowledge, predispositions, and campaign messages in shaping the behavior of voters at the polls. Based on the RAS model of political persuasion, which incorporates the first two concepts but not the third, we propose a modified model that takes into account respondents levels of news media use. According to this model, attention and exposure may intensify the relationship between their pre-existing attitudes and vote choice. Testing the model in the context of the 2004 presidential elections reveals support for this model for some  but not all  salient campaign issues. The results are discussed in light of current research on media environments and implications for future work on reinforcement effects."

Since the earliest days of online P2P activity, universities have served as key flashpoints in the broader file-sharing and intellectual property debates. But while there has been considerable policy attention to the emerging file-sharing case law, and some attention to the shifting legal and political strategies of IP holders most affected by P2P traffic (or most aggressive in asserting their rights), the multiple, frequently ambivalent, and highly varied responses of university network administrators have for the most part escaped sustained attention. This paper draws on survey, interview, and ethnographic data to explore the distinctive and heterogeneous policy sets put together by campus network administrators and decision-makers in dealing with IP issues associated with on-campus file-sharing practice. Such institutional policy sets constitute a crucial and understudied border zone between law and culture, functioning as: a) key translation points through which external IP claims get filtered (e.g., DMCA take-down notices); b) key micro-regimes through which a substantial amount of IP regulation is practically accomplished; and c) key laboratories for digital citizenship, through which the moral, cultural, and practical terrain of IP and file-sharing practice in a densely networked world are set."
2009-1437,Tensions between activism and advocacy in the mental health field: Identifying some tactical differences,Health in the News (High Density),,,,Paper,Tensions between activism and advocacy in the mental health field: Identifying some tactical differences,Health in the News (High Density),"Taking as its point of departure the distinction between health advocacy and health activism this paper elaborates the differences in various communication strategies adopted by individuals and groups in relation to mental health and illness. A distinction is identified between more activist oriented tactics, employed by participants in the survivor movement, and advocacy aligned tactics that are more likely to be emphasized by those who operate within and according to the biomedical model in mental health. The paper draws from selected media coverage in Australia to illustrate some of the tactics used by activists and some of the shifts in thinking called for by proponents of postpsychiatry. These media items are situated in the larger context of activism in the mental health field, from which the following themes are identified: reclaiming madness and using humour; elevating the first person voice and experience; and resisting medicalization and recognizing the harm of psychiatric labels. In this context, the paper identifies the limitations of the concept of mental health literacy and the importance its advocates place on persuading people to adopt medicalized definitions of their experiences. We argue that this approach fails to recognize that many people either do not see their experiences in these terms or overtly resist medicalization and pathologization. We conclude that activism in the mental health field offers an exciting area of exploration for health communication and media studies scholars with a theoretical and practical interest in health activism and related issues of identity and power relationships."

nearly 1,000,000 word corpus produced by 395 interns over 7 different
semesters of an internship course participating in an online
discussion forum designed to support their reflection on work and
professional life. This study examines what terms are used, where, and
how among participants providing accounts and expressing differences
of opinion in online discussion. The study explores how metalanguage

2009-1439,Terrorism as Mass Mediated Fragility,Fragility: Towards a New Vocabulary of Culture and Communication,,,,Paper,Terrorism as Mass Mediated Fragility,Fragility: Towards a New Vocabulary of Culture and Communication,"The reporting of terrorism or even its nature as a media event are representative instances of modernitys contradictory complexity. This kind of event suits the media well. Its profit-oriented management and global reach prompted by technological advances have helped transform terrorist attacks into global media events, offering drama, tragedy, shock, anger, grief, fear, and panic. Terrorism is a real threat to our world, but it is a menace that is somehow over-rated. The graphic media images heighten the sense of insecurity, sparking great fear among people, and confirming the social belief that were living in a risk society. To some extent, terrorism as a media event exists to confirm our vulnerability. This presentation addresses fragility both as an effect and as a structural frame that supports media action in the case of catastrophic events such as terrorism."
2009-1440,Testing Affective Disposition Theory: A Comparison of the Enjoyment of Hero and Antihero Narratives,Our Relationships With Media Characters,,,,Paper,Testing Affective Disposition Theory: A Comparison of the Enjoyment of Hero and Antihero Narratives,Our Relationships With Media Characters,"From Bonnie & Clyde to Mr & Mrs. Smith, audiences are attracted to morally questionable protagonists. Why is that the case? One leading theory of media enjoyment, affective disposition theory (ADT), would seemingly offer some answers. An online experiment examined two general questions: How do viewers enjoy dramatic narratives that violate the traditional protagonist-is-morally-superior-to-the-antagonist formula (e.g., antihero films)? And how, if any, does the enjoyment process for these narratives differ from their traditional counterparts? A total of 205 German citizens viewed a film clip that was introduced and described as either following a traditional hero plot or a morally problematic, antihero one. Results suggested that antihero film enjoyment does not follow the ADT formula. Identification with the antihero protagonist, rather than moral judgment of character behavior, predicted enjoyment. The findings are discussed in light of recent scholarship on moral disengagement, story schema development, and entertainment theory."
2009-1441,Testing a Model of Resource Assessment as a Basis for Developing Strategic Communication Plans,New Frontiers of Public Relations Theory Development,,,,Paper,Testing a Model of Resource Assessment as a Basis for Developing Strategic Communication Plans,New Frontiers of Public Relations Theory Development,"Seeking to extend research on public relations strategy, this study tests a Model of Resource Assessment (MRA) intended to help public relations practitioners develop strategic plans that address fundamental organizational objects and that earn practitioners a stronger managerial position. MRA purports to offer a broader, yet accurate, directional guide for communication strategy development by conceptualizing PR strategy as the planning process of narrowing disconnects between stakeholders perceptions of an organizations resources. The fundamental premises of the model were tested through a series of interviews, focus groups and a web survey (n = 312) of members of an agriculture college at a large Midwestern university. The results suggest that points of incongruence in the minds of internal and external members about the organizations resources (core strengths) can become the basis of a comprehensive strategic communication direction. The implications of the findings are discussed."
2009-1442,Testing a Projection Explanation for Exemplar Effects,How the Media Impact Perceptions of the Self and Others,,,,Paper,Testing a Projection Explanation for Exemplar Effects,How the Media Impact Perceptions of the Self and Others,"This study examines underlying mechanisms in the relationship between exemplification in mass media and peoples perception of public opinion. Previous research has consistently shown that exemplars influence the perception of current and future public opinion for controversial issues. Based on projection theory, we hypothesized that the effect of exemplification on estimates of public opinion change would be mediated by individuals own attitude toward an issue. To test the hypothesis, we employed the Sobel test and the Bootstrap method outlined by Preacher and Hayes (2004) as well as a series of Ordinary-Least Square (OLS) hierarchical regression analyses. Results show that the proportion of exemplars in a new article is positively associated with estimates of current and future public opinion. In addition, the relationship was fully mediated by the individuals attitude. In other words, vivid exemplars may have their strongest initial effect on the audiences personal opinions. And personal opinion, in turn, strongly influences perceived public opinion via projection effects. This finding provides a new potential explanation for the process by which exemplification affects peoples estimations."
2009-1443,Testing Causal Direction in the Influence of Presumed Media Influence,Top Four Papers in Mass Communication,,,,Paper,Testing Causal Direction in the Influence of Presumed Media Influence,Top Four Papers in Mass Communication,"According to the influence of presumed media influence hypothesis, people estimate the potential effects of media on other people and change their attitudes or behavior as a consequence. In recent years many studies offered some support for this idea. However, a central limitation of these studies is that all of them utilized correlational methodology and thus do not offer a valid way to infer causal direction. The current research examined the causal direction in the influence of presumed media influence using experimental methodology. We manipulated the perceived influence of watching pornography in order to ascertain its causal relationship with support for censorship. As expected, we found that that providing information about positive effects of pornography indeed weakened the support for censorship, though this result was true only for women."

In study one we seek to replicate findings consistent with error management theory in the context of face-to-face interactions. In study two, the underlying presumptions of the theory are directly tested by examining sex differences in perceptions of the costs inherent in false positives and false negatives in pursuing sexual or committed relationships. Results are generally supportive of both sexual overperception and commitment skepticism biases."
2009-1445,Testing the Impact of Public Health Framing and Rich Sourcing,Health in the News (High Density),,,,Paper,Testing the Impact of Public Health Framing and Rich Sourcing,Health in the News (High Density),"This study examines whether changing the way newspaper stories report health news can induce shifts in readers' perceptions of significant health problems such as obesity, diabetes, immigrant health, and smoking. Two variables were manipulated in a controlled experiment: the quality of sourcing in the stories, and changing from an episodic, traditional frame to a thematic or public health frame. A public health frame involved incorporating information on context, risk factors, prevention strategies, and social attributions of responsibility. This study found that a public health frame did make readers more supportive of public policy changes and encourage them to change their own health behaviors. However, it did not alter their attributions of responsibility for health problems from one of blaming individuals to seeing the larger social factors.
Adding richer sourcing to the public health frame did not increase these effects, nor did readers find the public health stories to be more interesting, relevant, believable, important, and informative. In addition, there were differential results due to story topics that represent uncontrolled effects. The implications for improving health reporting to encourage positive change in society are discussed.

The authors would like to thank Ph.D. student Liz Gardner for her expert assistance creating the stories. This research was funded by a grant from the California Endowment."
2009-1446,Testing the Relationship Between (Tele)presence and Transportation: The Case of Mental Illness,Keywords in Information Systems: Attitudes (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,Testing the Relationship Between (Tele)presence and Transportation: The Case of Mental Illness,Keywords in Information Systems: Attitudes (High Density),"Experimental results are presented in order to explore how transportation and (tele)presence may affect attitude change given negative, stigmatizing portrayals, or positive, sympathetic portrayals of those with mental illness in a crime drama. It is hypothesized that the experience of viewing narratives may have some effect on the adoption of story-consistent beliefs  and this has implications for the areas of entertainment-education research as well as stigma research. Results support that those who viewed a narrative with a sympathetic portrayal of a character with mental illness expressed more favorable views toward those with mental illness than those in a control or stigmatizing portrayal condition. While levels of transportation (Green & Brock, 2000; 2002) and (tele)presence (Lombard & Ditton, 1997) highly correlated, they did not moderate attitudes toward those with mental illness."
2009-1447,Testing the Spiral of Silence in the Virtual World: Monitoring Opinion-Climate Online and Individuals' Willingness to Express Personal Opinions in Online Versus Offline Settings,Opinion Perception and Expression,,,,Paper,Testing the Spiral of Silence in the Virtual World: Monitoring Opinion-Climate Online and Individuals' Willingness to Express Personal Opinions in Online Versus Offline Settings,Opinion Perception and Expression,"This study extends the spiral of silence theory by taking into account the impact of new media on virtual behavior motivation. It examines individuals willingness to express opinions online and offline and tests how the constructs proposed by the spiral of silence theory work in each setting. Results of a survey (N=305) suggests when the likelihood of speaking out online increases, the likelihood of speaking out in a real setting also increases, and vice versa. Findings further explain that the congruency of future and current opinions with ones own opinions predicts the willingness to speak out offline. Findings indicated that this congruency of future and current opinions might fail to work in the online setting, however. Furthermore, while fear of isolation predicted the willingness to speak out online, it did not affect offline outspokenness. Finally, there was a significant tendency to estimate the Internet to be more efficient than the traditional media in monitoring the climate of opinion."

Focusing on the aftermath of the Ethiopian elections held in May 2005, it will show how the forces opposing the incumbent regime had been using a combination of information and communication technologies to influence and organize the protests and demonstrationsthat took place in the capital Addis Ababa and in other main cities. It will be looked at how even in a country with little teledensity, information posted online mainly by the very vocal and influential Ethiopian diaspora could spread virally through the use of mobile phones, leaflets and be published in oppositional newspapers.

The paper also reflects upon the challenges of doing research in conflict environments, especially on events that erupt unexpectedly, and have to be reconstructed in retrospect and often in the absence of hard data. It will partially respond to this challenge suggesting to look at events as eruptions of longer term tensions that can be understood by looking both at the information ecology of a country and at its political environment.

2009-1450,The Abuse of Attacks: A Functional Analysis of the 2008 Spanish Presidential Debates,Debates,,,,Paper,The Abuse of Attacks: A Functional Analysis of the 2008 Spanish Presidential Debates,Debates,"This study applied the Functional Theory of Political Campaign Discourse to analyze the two debates featuring the two main political leaders in the 2008 Spanish general elections. Overall, candidates focused more on attacks than on acclaims or positive statements (this was due to the challengers emphasis of attacks; the incumbent used more acclaims than attacks). Few defenses were used. Policy was a more common topic than the candidates or parties. The Incumbent acclaimed more, and attacked less, than the challenger both generally and in particular on past deeds. General goals ideals were used more to acclaim than to attack. These results are similar to those obtained in the content analysis of electoral debates, following the Functional Theory in the United States of America, Ukraine, South Korea and Israel, so it appears that there are some common characteristics in political debates that transcend borders."
2009-1451,The Aceh Besar Midwives with Mobile Phones Program: Design and Evaluation Perspectives using the Information and Communication Technologies for Healthcare Model,Mobile2.0: Beyond Voice?,,,,Paper,The Aceh Besar Midwives with Mobile Phones Program: Design and Evaluation Perspectives using the Information and Communication Technologies for Healthcare Model,Mobile2.0: Beyond Voice?,"This paper examines the use of mobile telephones to transmit routine health service data from rural sites into a central health information system. The system, incorporating the government health infrastructure, was developed for rural midwives based in tsunami-affected Aceh Besar, Indonesia, to improve healthcare for pregnant women and children. The midwife mobile phone project took place in 15 public health centers, involving 223 midwives, 15 midwife coordinators and obstetricians/gynecologists. 122 midwives, forming the study group, use their project cell-phones to link up to hospital-based doctors to aid complicated pregnancies, receive training and health support from midwife coordinators at health centers, and instantaneously deliver medical indicators via Internet-borne SMS to a central database.
The quantitative research occurred via a longitudinal design: baseline data collection in September 2006, midline in July 2007, and the endline survey in December 2007. The mobile phone has proven to be an effective and efficient device for facilitating smoother communication among health workers and between them and the community. Besides communication, mobile devices also aid in disseminating medical and health-related information to the midwives, who in turn convey this knowledge to their village community. Weak telecommunication infrastructure and particular problems in technological design have been identified as key barriers. Findings indicate that the introduction of the mobile phones has helped in improving the medical knowledge of the midwives. Specific recommendations are discussed to address the issues of poor cellular reception, long-term sustainability of ICT for health projects, and the communication gaps between midwives, midwife coordinators and doctors."

It is a matter of worldwide concern because the role of intellectuals in is social change everywhere is an open question. How are the demands of scholarly rigor related to the social and cultural commitments required of social change? This question is particularly relevant in Africa given debate over the possibility of an African approach to such questions. Some would say Africa requires a distinctive approach and others not. This question will be explored using the theory of communicative action, as developed by German sociologist Jurgen Habermas"
2009-1453,The Age Factor: The Maturity of Technology as an Influence on Public Creation of Content,Old and New Media,,,,Paper,The Age Factor: The Maturity of Technology as an Influence on Public Creation of Content,Old and New Media,"This paper examines whether the maturity of technology constrains a medium from achieving public participation in creating content. It develops a theory that the age of the technology used to produce a communication medium, its relative maturity, influences how amenable that medium is to accepting publicly created content. I argue that the very newness of a new technology  the lack of professional standards as well as commercial constraints  invites broad participation. Conversely, the invitation list becomes more restricted as the technology matures."

Drawing on dozens of studies, articles, and books of the era, I find that radio sets and automobiles were seen as dual faces of a larger phenomenon in which mechanical and electrical devices were adopted into the home and made an important part of popular leisure practices. Critics of this new communication machinery charged that it introduced machine age regimentation into private life and engendered a sort of rootless mobility. Defenders, often representing big business, responded by arguing that the physical and mental mobility offered by new communication technologies was creating a more democratic culture. I argue that these interests valued mobility more for the blank slate it represented  a chance to design new ways of living dependent upon communication products  than its democratic possibilities."

This case study of two TAR episodes in Burkina Faso (season 12, fall 2007) goes beyond textual analysis to: (1) discover how local people (Burkinabé) experienced and negotiated their hybrid encounters with the American cast and producers; (2) examine how the episodes representations correspond to Burkina Fasos reality; and (3) assess benefits and costs for the country. Qualitative interviews at production sites reveal considerable evidence of postcolonial hegemony and commodification, alongside some resistance by the local co-production company, and some benefit to Burkinabé via financial compensation and exposure for tourism. On balance, the CBS network and TARs sponsors controlled the programs representations, audiences, and profits, while few Burkinabé had any agency or voice in encounters. Additionally, as Burkina Fasos government-controlled television does not air U.S. programs (and television is only minimally available in rural areas), few will ever even view the episodes."

Still, video games with content that is deemed unsuitable for children are played even by young children. With a focus on the situation in Germany the aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, the current state of literature on the importance of age ratings for the regulation of video games is scrutinized. Therefore, the focus is on the German rating systeme by the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (USK) [Entertainment Software Self Control]. This scheme is compared in particular to the American Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) scheme and parallels with the Pan-European PEGI-system (Pan European Game Information) are drawn. On the other hand, results from an exploratory survey study on the preferences for video games among German 8 to 12 year olds are presented (N=1703), arguing that the preference for video games that are  based on the German USK-code  not suitable for them is a widespread phenomenon in particular among boys."

However, they say little about the makeup of the smart mobs and their ways of communicating with each other to make a better society. This paper explores smart mobs in the candlelight demonstrations in South Korea in 2008 and the characteristics of smart mobs living in inhabitable cyberspace and physical space.
Smart mobs co-exist in cyberspace and the physical world through sharing of values in networked relationships. Despite differences in social status, gender, and age, smart mobs have transcended these differences by means of bottom-up communication. They are familiar with digital devices including virtual communities and wireless devices. Smart mobs have actively participated in online discussions, shared new experiences, created new values, and acted to revise biased newspaper reporting. They have evolved into social identities rather than remaining fragmented individual human beings."
2009-1458,The Art of Visual Communication,"Advertising, Aesthetics and the Public Sphere",,,,Paper,The Art of Visual Communication,"Advertising, Aesthetics and the Public Sphere","Firms facing an increasingly competitive market are often struggling to differentiate their offer from that of their competitors. The firms accommodation can offer unique opportunities to establish a distinct image in the consumers mind. By altering their tangible surroundings (e.g., their interiors), an organization can send messages that help consumers form corporate images. For instance, artwork display does not only arouse and stimulate observers, but may also affect beliefs concerning the firm that exhibits such a piece of art. Furthermore, service attributes may be derived from such impressions of the firm. With that in mind, commercial firms are increasingly turning to artwork to affirm and communicate their identity to stakeholders. However, as yet, little is known about the processes through which artwork display affects consumer perceptions in a service setting. Although, it is well established that artwork can transmit very rich and sophisticated messages, so far, art has been largely neglected in the literature addressing the influence of service environments. In this article, we explore the ways in which a paintings level of abstraction and vividness contributes to consumer impressions of (1) a service firm and (2) the services provided."

My paper examines a range of interactive television formats such as adult chat TV, home shopping, gaming, dating and psychic services. I discuss the way in which the dense image field, with its multiple windows and dispersed sites of address to the audience, permits such channels to simultaneously hail viewers into a number of different subjectivities, each of which offers a different actual or potential position of active engagement. I argue that interactive TV subverts televisions naturalized order in a number of ways, subordinating the production of content to the generation of revenue and reducing television to little more than a platform for the mediation of interactivity via telephony."
2009-1460,The Beijing Olympics and the Construction of Chinese Women,"Global Women: Deconstructing Images, Changing Perceptions",,,,Paper,The Beijing Olympics and the Construction of Chinese Women,"Global Women: Deconstructing Images, Changing Perceptions","This paper looks at the gender aspect and self-Orientalization of the Beijing Olympics by analyzing how non-athlete Chinese women were represented. I focus on the analysis of Chinese medal presenters (also called the Olympics misses), country placard presenters at the opening ceremony, and the cheerleaders who were considered part of sport presentation (tiyu zhanshi). The article situates the analysis in the larger context of China's search for modernity and Chinas emergent consumer culture. I argue that Chinese women were paradoxically constructed: on one hand, they were portrayed as the Oriental beauties who were reserved, submissive, shy and traditional, but on the other hand, they were portrayed as modern and sexualized, which indicates the complexities and tensions in incorporating women in China's nation-building project. I argue that representations of women reflect the anxiety and attempt for Beijing to neutralize and contain images of strong Chinese women and weak Chinese men (yinsheng yangshuai), which are considered prevalent in sports, education and many other fields in contemporary China. I also argue that as an important part of Chinas search for modernity that is inherently masculine, the Beijing Olympics reinforces womens subordinate positions and legitimates the objectification of women as being symbols of male desires."

Drawing on a reasoned-action framework we aim to identify (1) which underlying factors (e.g. attitudes, norms, perceived behavioral control) carry the greatest weight in predicting whether college undergraduates intend to get tested for STDs and (2) the specific beliefs that discriminate between intenders and non-intenders. Our findings suggest that subjects attitudes toward getting tested for STDs in the next 12 months contributed the most to intentions. Further, results of a belief-based analysis indicate that college students in our sample who do not intend to get tested for STDs may change their mind if they can be persuaded that getting tested would show that they respect their sexual partner or that getting tested would prevent them from spreading an STD to someone else."

In particular, I wish to complicate the politics of national identification and its emphasis on the idea of national homogeneity, which is largely supported by South Korean democratic national unification movements. I argue that the intertwining representational economy of gender and national authenticity imposes what I call the biopolitical Otherization of North Korea, in which North Korea is positioned as the essentialized body of the Korean nation under the rubric of deploying multiple regulatory aims for maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the politics of national identification. I discuss how the visual experience of eyewitness plays a role in the formation that gives anti-North Koreanism the discursive power of cultural differentiation. Particular attention is drawn to on-site textual and photographic representations of North Korea by South Korean newspapers, as a means of the empirical affirmation of the biopolitical Otherness of North Korea, during the historic event of the first official post-war inter-Korea talk held in Pyongyang from August 29th to September 2nd in 1972."
2009-1463,"The Birth of the ""Neoliberal"" City and its Media",The New Media City,,,,Paper,"The Birth of the ""Neoliberal"" City and its Media",The New Media City,"The title of this paper alludes to Michel Foucaults accounts of various births (of the prison, the asylum, the clinic) that individually and collectively contributed to the birth of liberal government in the West during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The paper suggests that Foucaults historiographic strategy, and his historical argument about liberalism (through key words such governmentality, biopower, security societies, freedom, and space) provide a useful perspective about the present relation of new media to the so-called digital- or cyber-city. Not only does this paper critically assess various assumptions about the new-ness of the current city and its media, by considering the long history of the new media city and liberalism, and the current contradictions of emergent and residual practices, but it also explains how a Foucaultian perspective about liberalism and biopoliticization provide an alternative to the dominant ways of explaining contemporary cities and their media only or primarily in terms of culture and/or economy. While the paper critically engages various key works about new media cities, it sketches how the current convergence of urban space, communication media, and neoliberal political rationalities and citizenship developed out of certain cities over the twentieth century. To consider this current convergence, the paper also will examine the recent intersection of old and new media--Reality TV formats such as Bravos Million Dollar Listing and web-resources such as Do It Yourself City (http://diycity.org/)."

Yet this questioning has its limits. In order to understand this shift, this paper will examine the cultural function of the gossip blog and its use of the ""Bitch"" as narrator, especially how this relates to the mediation of performative markers of femininity within a post-feminist context. In particular, the paper will ask how the recent shift to more malicious or ""Bitchy"" discussion of female celebrities, as well as the heightened profile of the female ""train-wreck"" celebrity, has been propelled by the rising popularity of new media gossip blogs. With Bitch rhetoric increasingly dominating everyday gossip and commentary regarding female celebrities, this paper will question whether this post-feminist hostility and judgment has now become an inextricable component of celebrity gossip.

1. The characteristics of and reasons for the shift in Britain from an informational Whitehall model of government communication to a campaigning, strategic Millbank model.
2. The tensions and contradictions generated by the Blair approach to communication, especially in the early years of his premiership, and how they contributed to undermine trust, the resource most necessary for communication.
Drawing upon the literatures of political communication and public relations scholar-ship, the study examines the strategic approach to government communication and the usefulness of the mixed motives model of public relations (Dozier et al, 1995) for gov-ernment communication. It concludes that while the mixed motives model may suggest a way forward for thinking about effective government communication, in information rich and trust poor times, communicators and researchers may do better to explore the principles, processes and practices that most effectively engender trust."

The presenter analyzes blogging content and data from interviews with bloggers, in order to critically assess the successes and failures of the social media during the 2006 coup d'état in Fiji. While the traditional Fijian media were suspected by many of being corrupted or intimidated, the new Fijian blogosphere seemed to become for many a public sphere of more honest and freer discussions. Thus, people inside and outside of Fiji turned to the blogosphere to get information and to contribute commentary during the 2006 coup d'état. However, there were also possibilities for launching rumors, spreading threats, and provoking fear in the blogosphere. This presentation discusses the implications of the social media being positioned as alternatives to traditional media in Fiji in 2006, reflecting on the potential of social media as alternative media."

Social media have provided a means of expression for a variety of forms of nationalism (from those questioning or opposing the integration of France in the European Union, to those questioning or opposing the presence of diverse minority groups, such as Eastern Europeans and non-Europeans, in France). Concomitantly, social media have also provided a way of having their voices heard for minority people and groups who attempt to present and discuss their heritages and values. This presentation provides an overview of the discourses and the issues of and about nationalism and minorities in the French blogosphere, and employs a critical theory perspective in the consideration of the features and consequences of this common, yet divisive, virtual public sphere."

This presentation combines theories of the cybershpere with historical and statistical data from Romanian media analysts and Internet providers, to address the features and impact of the blogosphere in postcommunist Romania. The panelists discuss a range of principles of cybercommunication, such as the equality of participants, the right of anonymity, and the right of withdrawal. Then, the panelists examine how and why these principles of cybercommunication have come to be considered as the norms for democracy in Romania, so that not only the social media but also the mainstream media are claiming and striving to employ them. The panelists reflect on the potential and the challenges of positing the blogosphere as a public sphere in postcommunist Romania."
2009-1469,The Blogosphere in the United States: Corporations Own the Agora,vative Key Words in Communication: Blogospheres around the World,,,,Paper,The Blogosphere in the United States: Corporations Own the Agora,Innovative Key Words in Communication: Blogospheres around the World,"In the United States, social media (social networks such as Facebook, the blogosphere, micro-blogging services such as Twitter, social news services such as Digg, etc.) have resurrected public dialogue and the public sphere. Social media have empowered individuals on several fronts  politics, consumerism, and education are a few examples. Social media participants seem to forget that their public sphere, or agora, is not a genuinely public space: it is in turn owned by corporations such as Facebook, Yahoo, etc. Social media are blurring boundaries between public/private, personal/organizational, work/leisure, and as such present new and interesting challenges for users, theorists, and social critics. These challenges are compounded by the fact that these apparently public spheres are not genuine public spaces. This presentation discusses these social challenges of social media from a critical theory perspective, and illustrates them with examples that may provide clues to possible solutions."
2009-1470,The Body Politic: T-Shirts From the 2008 Presidential Campaign,The Politics of Commercial Culture,,,,Paper,The Body Politic: T-Shirts From the 2008 Presidential Campaign,The Politics of Commercial Culture,"In the 2008 presidential campaign, political communication, consumer culture, and viral marketing converged in a way never before seen in American politics. Attempts by members of the public to use T-shirts to appropriate the systems of consumption and advertising for politically progressive ends became enormously widespread and highly visible, prompting a wave of press coverage and helping to revolutionize an increasingly interactive political merchandising industry. Yet it remains unclear whether or not these myriad attempts to use communicative commodities such as T-shirts for political purposes actually succeed in enlivening the public sphere and contributing positively to the health of the American democratic political system. The evaluation of political T-shirts becomes all the more difficult when their exact status and social function are so ambiguous and unstable, as press reports and retailer sales pitches alternately frame them as fundraising objects, measures of voter enthusiasm and support, agents of public persuasion, and markers of lifestyle fashion.
The appropriation of consumption and marketing practices for political ends clearly presents a number of risks, among them the possible trivialization of the political and the increased ability for socially problematic messages to receive public exposure. Yet for all its potential drawbacks, the political T-shirt has emerged in the 2008 election cycle as a powerful and important medium of communication, and while its exact role may remain ambiguous, its origins in far-reaching sociocultural developments means that it will only continue to grow in the years ahead as a key feature of American political and cultural life."
2009-1471,The Bottom of the Pool: Gray Affect and the Smell of Aging,"War, Risk, and Biopolitics",,,,Paper,The Bottom of the Pool: Gray Affect and the Smell of Aging,"War, Risk, and Biopolitics","This essay theorizes age and desire across a diverse range of critical affect theories. It asks: how and why might feeling old matter? More concretely, it deals with age and affective belonging as they relate to materiality, corporeality, and embodiment. Lauren Berlants two recent articles Nearly Utopian, Nearly Normal: Post-Fordist Affect in La Promesse and Rosetta and Slow Death (Sovereignty, Obesity, Lateral Agency) will serve as primary theoretical touchstones for my analysis, specifically as they help process the ways aging bodies get felt in a globalizing, neoliberal economy. Because age-related affects operate on shifting trajectories of desire and despair, uselessness and responsibility, and angst and presence, but always in specific relationships with labor, materiality, and decaying corporeality, they function as mobile markers of social proximity and success.
I weave my critical analysis in this paper through two popular narrativesRon Howards 1985 Hollywood film Cocoon and grunge band Nirvanas 1991 music video Smells Like Teen Spiritbecause I think that they can do a certain kind of enunciative labor on behalf of critical theories of affect and aging. My hope is that this work might help to answer two distinct questions. First, how might my reading of cultural narratives of age and affect in these two instances mobilize creative diagnostics of material belonging and enunciate slippery positionalities in decaying circuits of desire? Second, how might these media objects serve as useful heuristics for theorizing affect and belonging more generally?"
2009-1472,"The Candidacy of Stephen Colbert: Fake News as Political Argument, Not Political Information",Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,"The Candidacy of Stephen Colbert: Fake News as Political Argument, Not Political Information",Political Communication Poster Session,"This paper presents a narrative of Stephen Colbert's 2007 presidential candidacy, analyzing it in the context of the body of literature about The Daily Show. Instead of focusing on the informational aspects of fake-news shows, as many Daily Show studies have, it examines the arguments Colbert makes and his success at making them. It finds that Colbert made compelling cases for the ability of the media to be manipulated, having convinced political journalists to cover him as they would a serious candidate, and against the idea that anyone can run for president."
2009-1473,The Challenges of Addressing Islam in Communication and Cultural Studies,Media Studies and the Question of Religion: The Challenges of the Religious Object,,,,Paper,The Challenges of Addressing Islam in Communication and Cultural Studies,Media Studies and the Question of Religion: The Challenges of the Religious Object,"This paper addresses the challenges that communication and cultural studies scholar face in the study of Islam and the practice of it. On the one hand, in their attempts to rescue Islam from the grotesque distortions it has received recently, scholars from within the Islamic communities risk offering an essentialized conception of Islam that is itself a distortion. On the other, scholars from the North are increasingly grappling with the problems posed by what they perceive to be Islam. In this context, complicated relationships between what are usually taken to be popular culture and religion place a nuanced analytical understanding of religion-media-popular culture dynamics beyond the reach of the outsiders. Considering the case of recent writings on Iran, I demonstrate the challenges posed to both camps in the study of the practice of religion in a context where forces of modernity and tradition are routinely negotiated in everyday life in the global era."
2009-1474,The Changing of the Image of China: A Framing Analysis of Coverage in the Time Magazine From 1992 to 2008,"New Media, National Image, and Social Transition in the Chinese Context",,,,Paper,The Changing of the Image of China: A Framing Analysis of Coverage in the Time Magazine From 1992 to 2008,"New Media, National Image, and Social Transition in the Chinese Context","The representation of foreign country in US media has been studied continuously over the past three decades. In studying national image, framing is one of the most frequently adopted theories. Previous studies have mostly utilized dichotomy or trichotomy to identify the frame of country image, often categorizing frame of a nations image into either negative or positive, with some including neutral. However, these frames could neither capture the tensions among expressed elements of meaning, nor between what is said and what is left unsaid.
Thus this study employs both qualitative content analysis and qualitative discourse analysis to examine the specific trends of the American elite magazine Time in framing China from 1992 to the present. Stratified Sampling is applied and a total of 206 reports from Times website were downloaded and analyzed.
To operationalize the concept of framing, this study applies Pans four structure (syntactical, script, thematic, and rhetorical) dimensions (Zhongdang & Kosicki, 1993) of frames to analysis articles because it is one of the most comprehensive operationalization of framing. Instead of sticking to it, the author developed it to embrace operable indicators that it does not specify: Thematic structure is operationalized into four indicators: problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation and treatment recommendation, while rhetorical structure is operationalized into metaphors, data, exemplars, catchphrase and citation.
The study found that core frames covering China shifts from ideology conflict to economic conflict, China image shifts from illegitimate other (framing China to be an enemy that should be eliminated) to legitimate other (framing China as a normal competitor that US has no moral right to eliminate). Meanwhile a couple of frames, namely, the morality of the competition, American standard, accountability on China, superior perspective, etc, remained constant. Findings also show some style changes in the writing of articles, depicting China from conspicuous criticizing, macroscopic, single perspective and fixed stereotype to inconspicuous criticizing, microcosmic, multiple and changing perspective."
2009-1475,The Citizen Audience and European Transcultural Public Spheres: Exploring Civic Engagement in European Political Communication,"Deliberation, Political Engagement, and Participation in the Public Sphere (High Density)",,,,Paper,The Citizen Audience and European Transcultural Public Spheres: Exploring Civic Engagement in European Political Communication,"Deliberation, Political Engagement, and Participation in the Public Sphere (High Density)","This paper aims at shedding light on how civic engagement matters for the emergence of a European public sphere. It inquires the citizens role in constituting it and asks how citizens being located in different cultural and political contexts participate in and appropriate EU-political communication. First, the paper develops a pragmatic approach to the European public sphere emphasizing the importance of citizens communicative participation. It is assumed that the constitution of public spheres  representing social constructions fulfilling democratic functions  ultimately rely on citizens (media based) perception of the impact of common problems and political decisions as well as on their subsequent participation in public discourses (Dewey 1927). The second part of the paper presents the findings of empirical case studies conducted in France, Italy and Germany to explore citizens engagement in and appropriation of the European constitutional debate."
2009-1476,"The Citizens Voice: Albert Hirschmans Exit, Voice, and Loyalty and its Contribution to Media Citizenship Debates",Citizen Voice and the Branded Nation,,,,Paper,"The Citizens Voice: Albert Hirschmans Exit, Voice, and Loyalty and its Contribution to Media Citizenship Debates",Citizen Voice and the Branded Nation,"This paper analyses Albert Hirschmans Exit, Vice and Loyalty (Hirschman 1970) as a basis for understanding the relationship between media and citizenship. It considers the significance of Hirschmans concept of voice in relation to media policy, media participation through user-created content, and the rise of citizen media and citizen journalism. It associates these developments with a de-centering of both media practice and media studies, as considered by Couldry (2006a, 2006b). It concludes by suggesting that voice and participation, rather than citizenship, may constitute a more suitable foundation for understanding new digital media initiatives."
2009-1477,The Coevolution of Multiplex Networks in Organizational Communities,Current Research on Organizational Networks,,,,Paper,The Coevolution of Multiplex Networks in Organizational Communities,Current Research on Organizational Networks,"This research examines how multiplex organizational networks coevolve. Evolutionary and network theories were used to develop hypotheses about tie formation in both uniplex and multiple networks in organizational communities. Based on data between 1997 and 2005 collected from the records of development projects in the field of Information and Communication Technology for Development, the study demonstrates that dynamics in one network are significant drivers of tie formation in the other network at both dyadic and triadic levels. In particular, results show that the effects of common third-party ties and structural embeddedness exist across multiplex networks, leading to the formation of dense local clusters of organizations. Further, the study explains endogenous and exogenous mechanisms that lead to the formation of multiplex ties. The results suggest that resource similarity of organizational dyads, resource width, and organizational centrality have positive effects on the propensity of multiplex tie formation. These results have implications for organizations networking strategies in a wide variety of developing as well as developed organizational communities."
2009-1478,The Comical Inquisition: Political News on Italian Television in the Age of Entertainment,Fake News: International Perspectives on the Intermeshing of Entertainment and Politics,,,,Paper,The Comical Inquisition: Political News on Italian Television in the Age of Entertainment,Fake News: International Perspectives on the Intermeshing of Entertainment and Politics,"This paper observes the role that Italian fake-news program Striscia la Notizia (The news is creeping) plays within the larger sphere of television journalism in Italy. The program is a pioneer in the genre dating back to 1987, when commercial television networks in Italy were not allowed live news broadcasting. Striscia, the brainchild of a former situationist artist turned television producer, has over the years gained a loyal following for unmasking the rhetorical and technical mechanisms of traditional newscasts, particularly those of public television Rai. In a more recent period, the program has distinguished itself for effectively performing a unique blend of comedy and investigative journalism. Often dismissed by media scholars in Italy, Striscia la Notizia is an excellent example of the transformations undergone over the past two decades by the Italian televisual public sphere, increasingly characterized by a contamination of informative and entertainment practices, which operates as the most fitting context for the emergence of new types of political subjects, such as the television magnate Silvio Berlusconi."
2009-1479,The Common Grounds and Grand Canyons Between Liberals and Conservatives: A Life Style Analysis,Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Common Grounds and Grand Canyons Between Liberals and Conservatives: A Life Style Analysis,Political Communication Poster Session,"Many publications have compared the differences between liberals and conservatives in the United States in terms of their stands on political and social issues. The present study, using a large national survey of consumers, investigates how liberal and conservatives differ in daily lives, activities and opinions  such as shopping, views of advertising, and usage of the Internet. Some similarities between these two groups are examined as well. Implications for political, marketing, and communication research are discussed."
2009-1480,The Communicative Constitution of Stakeholder Identification,The Communicative Constitution of Organization: Multiple Approaches,,,,Paper,The Communicative Constitution of Stakeholder Identification,The Communicative Constitution of Organization: Multiple Approaches,"The purpose of this research is to challenge current understandings of organizational stakeholder relationships, especially the process of stakeholder identification. I propose a new direction, moving away from the role-based identification of homogeneous stakeholders defined by mangers of focal organizations, and instead towards a more communication-centered view that identifies stakeholders within a network of organizational relationships in connection to focal problems and issues. This helps move stakeholder thinking beyond current discussions of who is/is not a stakeholder in some isolated, objective sense and instead presents a more nuanced understanding that captures the complexity of organizational relationships and the stakes on which those connections are established. To do this I ground understandings of stakeholder identification within a communication-as-constitutive of organizations (CCO) perspective. This can both advance our knowledge of stakeholder thinking and clarify our understanding of CCO and its application in organizational scholarship. I begin with background information on stakeholder identification in order to justify the need for a communicative perspective. Next I provide an overview of CCO in order to explain how this theoretical framework is relevant to understanding stakeholder identification. Then I present a case study of an interorganizational collaboration that demonstrates the intersection of CCO and stakeholder identification. I conclude with a discussion about the communicative constitution of stakeholder identification and the implications of this research."
2009-1481,The Communicative Self-Discipline Needed to Achieve Stasis in Deliberative Interaction,The Practice of Deliberation,,,,Paper,The Communicative Self-Discipline Needed to Achieve Stasis in Deliberative Interaction,The Practice of Deliberation,"Stasis is a concept in ancient rhetorical texts that identifies a central concern for advocates in a debate. When there is disagreement on an issue, it is not enough for advocates to advance what they consider the best case for their position. The case on each side has to turn on what it is that is at issue, about what is being disagreed about. In short, the case on each side has to be relevant and responsive to the opposing case. It is a central theme of much work in LSI that to be coherent and engage in interaction in a coordinated way, what one says has to be relevant and responsive to what others have said. In that case, it should not be difficult for parties deliberating to achieve stasis, and failures to do so should be markedly incoherent and uncoordinated. And yet the evidence presented in the other papers on this panel reveal that persons do engage in debate without achieving stasis, speaking relevantly to each other but not responsively. Evidently, to achieve stasis there is a special sense in which what is said must be relevant and responsive to what other say. That special sense is captured by a distinction Tracy made between event relevance and issue relevance. The former involves talk that is about the same topic; the latter involves talk on that topic that is also about the same issue--the same matter in dispute. To achieve issue relevance requires that one set aside some or all of what one wants to say on a topic and confines oneself to what there is to say on the topic that addresses what is at issue. In the face of disagreement, where ones face is threatened and the achievement of ones wants is threatened, one may have much to say on the topic that is relevant but not responsive. It requires a special self-discipline to resist this and speak just to the issue. How this self-discipline can be cultivated, how it is manifest in language and social interaction, and how personal ability and cultural premises come to bear, are all questions of larger social import for us to address."
2009-1482,The Compelling Arguments Hypothesis and Individual Differences in Sensitivity to Negative Issue Attributes,Expanding the Study of Agenda Setting,,,,Paper,The Compelling Arguments Hypothesis and Individual Differences in Sensitivity to Negative Issue Attributes,Expanding the Study of Agenda Setting,"The affective compelling arguments hypothesis of agenda setting proposes that salience transfer of issue attributes from media to public also increases the salience of the issue itself and that this preferentially occurs for negative issue attributes. Further study may provide important clues regarding the mechanism underlying agenda setting.
We tested the affective compelling arguments hypothesis in a three-condition experiment in which college undergraduates (n=303) either watched a video (control) or watched the video plus a PSA about poverty, framed as either gains or losses. The survey included a measure of attachment style, a personality variable associated with affect regulation. The anxiety attachment dimension is associated with chronically accessible negative affect in memory.
As expected, agenda setting for the poverty issue was preferentially observed in individuals who were both high in attachment anxiety and randomized to the loss frame condition. Attachment style may provide one model for studying agenda setting mechanisms."

Data indicate competitive outcomes act as a significant component to game experience affective responses. In doing so, this study indicates that simply placing participants in a gaming situation for 20 minutes in either a violent or nonviolent situation with no resolution wholly underestimates the intricacy of game play as competition outcome and identification impacts affective reactions."
2009-1484,The Conditionality of Source Use: Comparing Source Use in U.S. and Swedish Television News,Patterns in News Sourcing,,,,Paper,The Conditionality of Source Use: Comparing Source Use in U.S. and Swedish Television News,Patterns in News Sourcing,"While there is consensus regarding the importance of the medias use of sources, there are only few comparative studies on how the media in different countries use sources. Most comparative research is furthermore focused on the coverage of specific events, such as wars and election, and on newspapers. To extend prior research, the purpose of this study is to compare the use of sources in routine news coverage in television news in the United States and Sweden. The results show that there are significant differences between the source use in U.S. and Swedish television news, which are conditional on the location and length of the news stories, as well as whether they are about politics or other topics. Based on the results, the implications for further research and generalizations regarding the medias source use are discussed."
2009-1485,The Construction of an Authenticity Index,Communication and Authenticity (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,The Construction of an Authenticity Index,Communication and Authenticity (Cross Unit),"The concept of authenticity is increasingly important in strategic communication campaigns. Recently scholars have begun to identify and examine various types of authenticity. For instance, Gilmore and Pine (2007) identified five genres of perceived authenticity corresponding to five economic associations. These are: commodities (natural authenticity), goods (original authenticity), services (exceptional authenticity), experiences (referential authenticity), and transformations (influential authenticity). I will illustrate these genres of authenticity with a case study, which aims to underscore a dual-prong strategic communication campaign used to boost morale among coffee growers of Colombia and solidify the coffee culture domestically, while simultaneously revitalizing Colombias leading national brand externally in the global coffee market. Finally, I will discuss the creation of an authenticity index to measure communication messages as well as perceptions of authentic organizations, including actions and operations, or spokespeople in the mind of internal or external target audiences. This should indicate specific areas for future research."

Instead, Obamas campaign offered racial redemption drama, a mythic and archetypal pattern of social and personal transformation, purification and catharsis, seminally described by Kenneth Burke. I argue that Obamas persona and campaign mediates guilt about antiblack racism, white privilege and the moral ambiguity about the U.S. war and occupation of Iraq, as well as moral ambiguity and neoliberalism linked to the Clinton administration. In doing so, Obama recovers Martin Luther Kings vision of a beloved community and urgent, moral call for change, as well as the liberal optimism and call for new generational leadership associated with President John F. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy in the 1960s. The effects are a movement that features extreme optimism, historic levels of participation (especially among new and young voters), and a collective affirmative rhetorical posture (Yes, we can!). Such idealism generates a profound emotional response, but conceals racial/ethnic balkanization, antiblack racism, white class privilege, generational differences among women. It also diminishes the achievements of previous Democratic administrations (especially the Clinton administration in the 1990s) and conceals pragmatic concerns of governance that portend ideological struggles and corporate resistance."

A Longitudinal Study in Belgium,Newsworthiness and Gatekeeping,In this study we investigate to what extent intermedia agenda-setting effects are moderated by five factors: (1) lag length; (2) medium type; (3) language/institutional barriers; (4) issue type; (5) election time or routine time politics. Longitudinal analyses of the daily attention for 25 issues in 9 Belgian media during a period of eight years demonstrate that: (1) intermedia agenda-setting is mainly a short-term process; (2) newspapers have a stronger influence on television than vice versa; (3) language/institutional barriers suppress influences; (4) size of influences differs across types of issues; (5) intermedia agenda-setting is largely absent during election times.

Less work has focused on individual differences in reasoning about communication and its possibilities. Conceiving communication as a game or as an opportunity to create identities and situations in dialogue; conceiving communication as goal integration or information transmission; all these differences may vary by task and by individual. This project will use Dervins Sense-Making Methodology to invite young adults and policy experts to talk about two deliberative communication situations they have been involved with, situations that differ in perceived difficulty."

2009-1490,The CSI Cultivation Effect. Exploring the Influence of Need for Closure and the Disposition for Narrative Engagement,Mass Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The CSI Cultivation Effect. Exploring the Influence of Need for Closure and the Disposition for Narrative Engagement,Mass Communication Poster Session,"This study investigates the relationship between exposure to the television series CSI and attitudes about forensic science in a cultivation perspective, and specifically seeks to test the influence of need for closure and the moderating effect of an individuals disposition to be engaged in a narrative (engageability). A new scale of engageability is presented and validated with measures for trait empathy, need for affect and experiential thinking style. Results show that exposure to crime drama and overall television viewing are better predictors for attitudes about forensic science than exposure to CSI. Need for closure does not correlate with any of the viewing measures, but independently contributes to attitudes about forensic science. Engageability has a positive correlation with attitudes about forensic science, but it does not serve as a moderator for the cultivation relationship."
2009-1491,The Decline of the All-Issue Public: Examining Activism in the Narrowcasting Age,Keywords in Communication: Conceptualizing Publics in Public Relations,,,,Paper,The Decline of the All-Issue Public: Examining Activism in the Narrowcasting Age,Keywords in Communication: Conceptualizing Publics in Public Relations,"This paper presents a meta-analysis of several studies in which the situational theory was used to analyze publics arising around specific situation sets. The purpose of the study was to examine whether the traditional four types of publics are still relevant in the new media environment. In particular, the study questions whether all-issue publics are still relevant today. In this age in which issues increasingly are distorted by non-objective media channels, when people choose to get information from fragmented, narrow sources information, and when information sources often are chosen for their ability to reinforce prevailing opinions on issues  the formation of all-issue publics seems unlikely, if not impossible. The paper will examine these and other issues related to the definition of publics and of activism in this age of powerful, but fragmented, media technologies."

This study addresses this issue and updates our knowledge in this regard by content analyzing the portrayals of illnesses and related matters in 127 episodes aired from 2000 to 2007 of two top-ranked television medical dramas in the U.S. (Greys Anatomy and ER). Results indicate that men and women patient characters are equally portrayed, the elderly are underrepresented, and Caucasians and African Americans are the top two portrayed races. Further, the two shows portray a wide range of illnesses and diseases, and injury, cardiovascular disease and cancer are the top 3 most frequently portrayed. Also, the shows frame illness and heath mainly from a medical perspective in its references to the illnesss causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Implications are discussed."
2009-1493,The Development and Testing of the Instructional Interaction Theory,Advances in Theory and Research on Instructors and Instruction,,,,Paper,The Development and Testing of the Instructional Interaction Theory,Advances in Theory and Research on Instructors and Instruction,"Instructional researchers have been concern over the lack of instructional communication theories for at least the past 40 years. However, the voices expressing these concerns seem to have grown louder and more impatient as of late (Mottet, Frymier, & Beebe, 2006; Nussbaum, & Friedrich, 2005; Simonds, 2001; Waldeck, Kearney, & Plax, 2001). Weber, Martin, and Myers (2008) recently introduced Instructional Interaction Theory in an attempt to better understand the impact that teacher-student interaction has on learning outcomes. This manuscript looks to empirically test the validity of their model."

To answer these questions, we surveyed 690 preadolescents and adolescents (10-17 years) at three times with two half-year intervals. We found nonlinear relationships between age and both types of self-disclosure, whose shape differed for boys (U-shaped relationship) and girls (elongated S-shaped relationship). Both online and offline self-disclosure had a significant positive longitudinal effect on the quality of friendships, but this effect emerged only for adolescents older than 13. Boys more often than girls preferred online self-disclosure to offline self-disclosure. Boys also benefited more than girls from online self-disclosure to enhance the quality of their friendships."
2009-1495,The Dewey and Lippmann Exchange in Historical Context,"Revisiting Interwar Communication Research: Dewey, Lippmann, and the Chicago School",,,,Paper,The Dewey and Lippmann Exchange in Historical Context,"Revisiting Interwar Communication Research: Dewey, Lippmann, and the Chicago School","Today the fields of communication and political science frame the exchange that took place between John Dewey and Walter Lippmann in the 1920s as a great debate about the role of public opinion in modern democracies. Dewey emerges from this framing as the champion of participatory democracy while Lippmann is represented as its foe. The adversarial framing is recent; it acquired currency in the 1980s along with the resurgence of interest in Dewey and pragmatism. James W. Carey played a pivotal role in this reframing, which has reified into accepted wisdom of the origins of the field of media studies. However, archival evidence indicates that Dewey and Lippmann were allies in progressive causes during the 1920s, not adversaries. This matters because histories that reproduce the polarized interpretation build upon a house of cards."
2009-1496,The Differential Impact of Teacher Delivery Skills on Outcomes for Low- and High-Risk Adolescents in a Universal Prevention Program,"Media and Interpersonal Influences on Adolescent Health Cognitions, Intentions, and Behaviors",,,,Paper,The Differential Impact of Teacher Delivery Skills on Outcomes for Low- and High-Risk Adolescents in a Universal Prevention Program,"Media and Interpersonal Influences on Adolescent Health Cognitions, Intentions, and Behaviors","This study aims to extend research related to the primary prevention of substance use among high-risk adolescents by examining whether teacher delivery skills help explain differential effects between substance using and non-using adolescents who participate in All Stars, a middle school-based substance use prevention program. Participants were 48 teachers who taught in a large urban school district, and their respective 7th grade students (n=756). Overall, students who used substances reported significant improvements in program mediators, including normative beliefs and commitment, and marginally significant improvements in lifestyle incongruence. Two delivery skill factorsclassroom management and student-centered methodswere associated with different outcomes for both groups of students. Specifically, teachers classroom management skills were marginally related to decreases in students personal and public commitments to not use drugs for non-substance using students, as well as improvements in norms for substance users. Student-centered teaching methods predicted improvements in lifestyle incongruence (ideals) and parental attentiveness, and marginally predicted improvements in commitment and bonding, but only for students who had used substances. These methods also predicted declines for parental attentiveness for non-substance using students. Study results suggest that primary prevention programs can be effective for substance using adolescents, especially if taught by interactive teachers."

This research found that the majority of developing nations that have adopted the law have done so in the new millennium and more of them are in the lowest income groups than the previous decade. The pattern of nations adopting ATI laws in concentration appeared to follow the level of regional treaties, declarations, conventions, and charters that were signed. The study also showed that as a group, developing and industrialized nations with ATI laws had stronger political rights and civil liberties, though there were a number of nations in the group of developing countries that had weak political institutions. Industrialized nations without an ATI law were the highest income group; however, these nations scored lower as a group on political rights and civil liberties than developing nations with the ATI law. Six nations with an ATI law had GNI per capita of less than $826, which raises questions about the adequacy of infrastructure to implement the laws."
2009-1498,The Diffusion of a Task Recommendation System To,"Technology Diffusion at Home, Work, and Community",,,,Paper,The Diffusion of a Task Recommendation System To,"Technology Diffusion at Home, Work, and Community","This paper studies the diffusion of WorkFinder, an intelligent task recommendation system, in Wikipedia. We investigate both factors that predict who adopts WorkFinder and its impact on adopters future contributions to this online community. Analyzing logged data about participants activities in Wikipedia, we found that both individual characteristics and social ties influence adoption. Specially, we found that highly involved contributors were more likely to adopt WorkFinder; and interpersonal exposure to innovation, cohesion, and tie homophily all substantially increased the likelihood of adoption. However, connections to admin contributors, i.e. those more prominent contributors in Wikipedia community, did not influence adoption. Finally, although the WorkFinder innovation saw limited distribution, adopters made significantly more contributions to Wikipedia after adoption than their non-adopter counterparts in the comparison group.

2009-1499,The Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Piracy in the Classroom,"Restoring Copyright Balance in Academia: Fair Use, DMCA Exceptions, and Educational Exemptions",,,,Paper,The Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Piracy in the Classroom,"Restoring Copyright Balance in Academia: Fair Use, DMCA Exceptions, and Educational Exemptions","The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 makes it illegal to bypass encryption on digital media. This ban applies even in cases where the use of the media would otherwise fall under the fair use exception. For example, a student making a clip from a VHS tape for use in a classroom project is likely to be a fair use of the material. The use of a the same clip from a commercially available (and thus encrypted) DVD, however, would be outlawed by the DMCA. The DMCA also sets up a system in which the U.S. Copyright Office must hold a rulemaking every three years. In the rulemaking, they are empowered to grant exemptions to the DMCA. In 2006, two UPenn colleagues and I (with support from the ICA) successfully petitioned for a DMCA exemption for media professors making clips for classroom use. In the 2009 rulemaking, we will seek to expand that exemption. In addition, we will petition for an exemption for university and college studentsthose great pirates of the digital agewho need to edit and remix digital video in order to be students in the 21st century. This paper will explain the exemption process and make the case for the student exemption."
2009-1500,The Dilemma of Recognition: Muslim Responses to European Public Discourses on Islam,"lam, Culture, and Identity: Moving Beyond False Binaries",,,,Paper,The Dilemma of Recognition: Muslim Responses to European Public Discourses on Islam,"Islam, Culture, and Identity: Moving Beyond False Binaries","The presence and contribution of Muslims in European societies for the past fifty years or so has been articulated in European public discourses through the lens of various concerns and objectives. Muslims and Islam have been caught in the maelstrom of debates on contemporary European identity (Delanty, Neumann, Said, Todorova), moral panics about the dangers nation states face in the era of globalization, migration, and increasingly after September 11, terrorism, while the logics of colonialism and imperialism which have mediated the encounters between the West and many Muslim societies are still hegemonic in the encounters between Muslims and non-Muslims in contemporary European societies.

In this context, official strategies toward, and public discourses on European Muslims have revolved around a number of options: Cast as subaltern and alien at the same time, they have been approached, classified and administered in ways that have been based on strategies of ensuring (a) co-optation of particular elites who claim to speak on behalf of highly diverse and polyphonic communities, (b) demonization of entire communities whose cultures have been systematically seen as belated and defective, breeding fundamentalism and irrationality, (c) reduction to invisibility, whereby entire communities, their aspirations, concerns and fears have been banished from the universe of public discourse and whose contributions to European societies remain neglected and are rendered inconsequential. At the very same moment, drawing upon such public responses, powerful radical voices claiming to authentically represent European Muslims propose a separatist path that has no place for dialogue, coexistence and a shared future within European societies.

This paper attempts to explore the forms of collective action European Muslims have been engaged in to counter and unsettle the ways they are represented in European public discourses. Focusing on an extensive empirical investigation of the cultural politics that attempt to reverse the invisibility, other-representation and collective criminalization of European Muslims, as well as the designs of those who claim to constitute their authentic the proposed paper maps and the complex cultural landscape of European Islam that refutes the easy binary divisions established and maintained by official and authenticist discourses."

Used to describe hip-hop culture in the Southeastern United States, Dirty South stands as a metonymic reduction of a diverse and robust body of popular music and related cultural expression to a common characteristic: origins outside the established hip-hop homelands of New York City and Los Angeles. At the same time Dirty South has been deployed as an ironic reduction of a body of popular music and related cultural expression within the alternative country genre wherein whiteness, rurality, and cosmopolitanism are playfully refigured. By comparing the similarities and differences between the alternate uses of Dirty South as a trope of identity, this essay explores and evaluates the role of popular culture in challenging dominant narratives of identity, community, and citizenship."
2009-1502,"The Discursive Constriction of Power Through Specialization: The Role of Communication, Technology, and Agency in Homeless Coalitional Politics","cial Movement Communication: Technologies, Organizations, and Discourses",,,,Paper,"The Discursive Constriction of Power Through Specialization: The Role of Communication, Technology, and Agency in Homeless Coalitional Politics","Social Movement Communication: Technologies, Organizations, and Discourses","Information technologies have played an increasingly important role in facilitating collaboration in social movements over the last few years, but access and use are structured by a range of social factors. These differences are particularly stark in homeless activist projects, where housed activists and advocates work in collaboration with homeless participants on joint activities. In resource-poor collaborative settings, those with technological skills or organizational capacity have built online communication resources like websites, blogs and email lists that are used by other coalitional members for strategic purposes. While specialization in issue movements increases the reach and efficiency of collective activities, the separation of communicative tasks among participants reflects and re-enforces existing power dynamics by segmenting leadership and decisionmaking in participant action. This paper draws on discourse analysis of ethnographic, interview, and online data from a homeless mobilization campaign, to outline the interplay of communication, technology and agency in contemporary movements."
2009-1503,The Divorce Disclosure Model (DDM): Why Parents Disclose Negative Information About the Divorce to Their Children and Its Effects,Theoretical Advances in Disclosure and Avoidance Decisions,,,,Paper,The Divorce Disclosure Model (DDM): Why Parents Disclose Negative Information About the Divorce to Their Children and Its Effects,Theoretical Advances in Disclosure and Avoidance Decisions,"How parents talk about their divorce to their children can have a profound effect on childrens well-being and their relationships with their parents. Indeed, children need some information about the divorce to reduce their uncertainty and adapt (Afifi, Coho, & McManus, 2008). Most parents would agree that they need to talk to their children about the divorce. The difficulty rests in knowing what to tell ones children about the divorce, how much to tell them, and how to communicate it. These conversations are complex and often occur throughout the divorce process.
Parents disclosures about one another, in particular, are essential to determining how well children function after divorce. When parents talk negatively about each other to their children it has an adverse impact on childrens physical and mental health (e.g., Koerner, Wallace, Lehman, Lee, & Escalante, 2004; Koerner, Wallace, Lehman, & Raymond, 2002) and can affect the parent-child bond (e.g., Afifi & Schrodt, 2003). Unfortunately, there are no theoretical frameworks that thoroughly explain why parents disclose negative divorce information to their children and the impact of these disclosures. Consequently, the purpose of this manuscript is to provide a new theoretical model, the Divorce Disclosure Model (DDM) that explicates the motivations for why parents disclose negative information about the divorce to their adolescent children, the factors that influence these disclosures, and their impact on adolescents and parents personal and relational well-being."

Commentators have variously celebrated or decried this new world of media consumption, though all seem to recognize that patterns of attendance will be central to understanding the medias social impact. This paper begins by describing the relevant features of the digital media environment and making a case that public attention is an increasingly important theoretical construct in media studies. Second, it presents a structurational model of public attention inspired by Giddens(1984) work on the duality of structure. Third, it illustrates the central role that public measures, like those created by firms like Nielsen and Google, play in that structurational process. Finally, it notes how public measures shape audience fragmentation and speculates on how changing market information regimes will affect the duality of media."

The framework maintains that because components (e.g., context, tactic) of interaction can increase the accessibility of inferable goals, goal detection is a product of these cognitive linkages and the goals they activate. To test this framework in dyadic initial interactions, one participant was randomly assigned as the pursuer and the other as the detector. During the conversations, the detector sought a goal that varied in congruency (i.e., identical, concordant and discordant) with the pursuer's goal. The cognitive busyness of detectors was also manipulated. The level of efficiency at which the pursuer sought his/her goal was measured, as well as the accuracy and certainty of the detector's inference of the pursuer's goal. Results generally confirmed hypotheses: Efficiency, congruency and busyness interacted to affect accuracy, whereas an interaction between efficiency and busyness impacted certainty. Other results dealt with how detectors' perspective taking promotes accuracy for inefficient goal pursuit and how accuracy yields favorable ratings of pursuers' communication competence when goal inferences are certain. Results are discussed theoretically and methodologically."
2009-1506,The (Dys)function of Anxiety in Journalism: A Workplace Disability or a Tool in News Element Selection? A Study of Working Journalists in the United States and China,Working Conditions in Journalism,,,,Paper,The (Dys)function of Anxiety in Journalism: A Workplace Disability or a Tool in News Element Selection? A Study of Working Journalists in the United States and China,Working Conditions in Journalism,"This study is an experiment analyzing the sources of anxiety reported by journalists in China and the United States. It discovers that journalists anxiety comes from both workplace and news content. Sources of workplace anxiety deemed dysfunctional fall into five categories  cultural and political pressures, competition from other new organizations, pressure from supervisors and peers, and pressure from within the journalists themselves. Anxiety generated by problematic news elements can be used as a functional heuristic to support and enhance best practices enumerated by the canons of journalism. The same anxiety may serve to raise an intuitive red flag, warning editors to pause and take a second look at their work. Two proscriptive outcomes are suggested by these results: First, journalists should distinguish between the two sources of anxiety and understand one may be functional while the other dysfunctional. Second, they should be encouraged to learn to integrate anxiety stemming from news content into work routine and to use it as a tool to support the canons of journalism and enhance the news quality."

Appropriately, newspapers with those names became the dominant media forces  and notorious rivals  in the years immediately following independence from Spain. Based on archival work at the Yale University Latin American Collection, this paper seeks to understand their praxis and the standards they set for the role of the press that may be reflected today in Mexicos media and in the Spanish-language media in the United States. It compares their discourse to their practice to that extent that is evident in what they published and when they published it."

Perhaps religion embeds itself in the constitution of discourse most subtlety at the boundary of discourse and matter. Philip Grönings 2005 documentary film Die Große Stille (Into Great Silence), brings together two discursive fields, film and monastic life, that both rely on the material to evoke the immaterial. This paper uses and adapts Judith Butlers concept of matter as constituted citationally through language to analyze Grönings film. In Grönings film material surfaces are so deliberately and explicitly evoked as surfaces that they accentuate materiality to the point of disruption and lead viewers to encounter surface as the edge of the real via absence. Viewers are invited to experience the edge of materiality as signifying its transcendence."
2009-1509,The Effectiveness of the Galileo Message Strategy for International Development Campaigns,Reaching Across Borders: International Public Relations,,,,Paper,The Effectiveness of the Galileo Message Strategy for International Development Campaigns,Reaching Across Borders: International Public Relations,"This study examined the effectiveness of the Galileo message strategy for international development campaigns (IDCs). Without emotional and negative message framing, the message strategy emphasizes the close relationships between international aid and relatively familiar issues to target audiences, such as education, health, and human rights, which are literally neutral concepts. The results indicated a significant message effect. That is, the persuasive messages for IDCs indirectly facilitated positive attitude change toward international aid by enhancing the interrelationships among the concepts. In addition, the study supported the theoretical validity of the Galileo model that predicts future behavior. The results revealed that the attitude measure (Galileo attitude) considering interattitude structures is more adequate than the direct attitude measure (TRA attitude) that contains social-desirability biases."
2009-1510,The Effectiveness of the Length of Commercials in Different Types of Television Programs,Mass Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Effectiveness of the Length of Commercials in Different Types of Television Programs,Mass Communication Poster Session,This study investigated whether the impact of commercial length on the effectiveness of television advertising is altered depending upon the moods generated by television programs. A 2X2 factorial-designed experiment was conducted with two conditions of commercial-length formats (15-second and 30-second) and two conditions of program-induced moods (positive and negative). The findings of this study indicate that commercial length effects are more salient in affecting ad performance than effects generated by program context. Interaction effects between commercial lengths and context-induced moods were also examined.

A recursive structural equation model hypothesizing the causal relationship among patients online community activities, perceived social support, a sense of empowerment, and doctor-patient communication are tested within the context of Korean diabetes patients. In results from the Internet survey of 464 respondents, patients use of online community increased their intention to participate in doctor-patient communication through the process of perceiving social support from online communities; thus feeling a greater sense of empowerment. The findings from the present study will contribute to the theoretical accumulation of patient antecedents of doctor-patient communication not only by exploring the effect of computer-mediated social support on patient empowerment and doctor-patient communication, but also revealing the process of developing patient-initiated empowerment."

Sojourners voluntarily participating in this study are 15 international students with non-native English speaking background (N-NESB) from China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. The results based upon interviews suggested common language barriers socio-culturally producing world Englishes shock and repetition shock which manifests an extended sense of insecurity in sojourners. 13 participants were impinged by the experiences in world Englishes shock and 4 by repetition shock. Insecurity was found to be the most common negative feeling while frustration was the most common effect on their personal security which developed into a feeling of insecurity. Only two sojourners were not impinged by their experience in world Englishes shock because they appeared to possess positive attitudes towards it. Therefore, security and insecurity are keywords in or behind communication."
2009-1513,The Effect of Familiarity and Coordination on Designing Online Discussion Environments,cial Interactions in Virtual Groups,,,,Paper,The Effect of Familiarity and Coordination on Designing Online Discussion Environments,Social Interactions in Virtual Groups,"Communication coordination and common ground, two parts of Clarks conception of mutual understanding (1996), were examined in an educational collaborative setting. The study employed a 2 (chat, threaded discussion) x 2 (communication coordination training, no training) x 2 (familiarity intervention, no intervention) between-persons design. Two common computer-mediated communication modes, chat and electronic bulletin boards, were employed. One hundred fifty-six participants interacted in groups of three concerning a controversial social-issue task, homosexual marriage. Communication coordination was manipulated with a short training session. Common ground was manipulated through a short get-to-know-you session. Group members satisfaction with task completion and group process were assessed.
Multilevel analysis indicated a main effect for mode on task satisfaction, with threaded discussion ranking significantly higher than chat groups. The familiarity intervention had a main effect on satisfaction with group processes. An interaction between familiarity and communication mode was found for satisfaction with group processes. While chat group participants reported greater satisfaction from the familiarity intervention, participants in the threaded-discussion groups reported lesser satisfaction following the familiarity intervention. Together these findings suggest that chat is a more conducive medium for friendly, social discussions and prior familiarity improves satisfaction with human interactions. However, chat was not as effective for task satisfaction compared to threaded-discussion."
2009-1514,The Effect of Framing and Motivational Activation on the Processing of Health Messages,Keywords in Information Systems: Framing (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,The Effect of Framing and Motivational Activation on the Processing of Health Messages,Keywords in Information Systems: Framing (High Density),"Although research has looked at how gain and loss frames of health messages affect behavioral responses in people, there has been very little research done to understand how people process these messages. However, it is crucial to understand how people process these differently framed health messages in order to better explain their persuasion effects. This project will look at how gain and loss framed health messages for three different kinds of behavior  preventive, detective and discouraging bad behaviors, are processed differently by people who vary in terms of their appetitive and aversive motivational activation (PO and NB). Specifically, this research hopes to demonstrate that people who are high versus low in PO and those who are high versus low in NB will process these health messages (in terms of encoding and storage) very differently. Also, this research hopes to shed light on how Secondary Task Reaction Time (STRTs) will be affected by gain and loss frames for the three behaviors."

Participants (N = 2271) responded to a survey that allowed a test of a media use model based on information processing theory. Factor analysis supported a hierarchical model of media use in which 10 specific media were nested within four genres, with the genres arrayed along two dimensions of orienting. Results supported the hypothesis that the internet would facilitate the use of interactive media. The hypothesis that the internet would inhibit use of older, individualized media was sharply disconfirmed for print media. Causal modeling provided general support for the proposed but indicated that access rather than use of the internet increased use of media from three of the four genres. The effect of the identity (respondent age, sex, and ethnicity) and self-worth (socio-economic-status) variables on media use was partially mediated by motivation and access to the media."
2009-1516,The Effect of Media Dependency on Voting Decisions,Campaign Effects (High Density),,,,Paper,The Effect of Media Dependency on Voting Decisions,Campaign Effects (High Density),"This study tests the proposition that shifts in media dependency alter the basis upon which voting decisions are made. Media system dependency theory was applied to a survey (N = 401) of North-east Florida residents as a means to explain the relationship between social environmental factors, political media goals and use, and voting decisions. The results indicate that goals of understanding / orientation predict that issues and candidate leadership abilities form the basis of self-reported voting decisions and frequency of political media-use, whereas a goal of play is a significant predictor of likability and popularity-based voting decisions. Encouragement from interpersonal networks predicted intensity (i.e., perceived importance of media as a political source), and was a marginal predictor of understanding / orientation goals. The results are discussed from a media system dependency perspective."
2009-1517,The Effect of Media Literacy Education on Susceptibility to Media Bias,Visual Expertise/Education and Issues of Globalization and Popularization,,,,Paper,The Effect of Media Literacy Education on Susceptibility to Media Bias,Visual Expertise/Education and Issues of Globalization and Popularization,"Media literacy education programs are intended to educate students about how media are constructed visually and how they influence attitudes and behavior. This paper examines whether students who receive media literacy education are less susceptible to a nonverbal media bias effect. Operationally, a nonverbal media bias effect occurs when people, using visual information only, judge an interviewee more negatively when the interviewer's nonverbal behavior toward him is hostile rather than friendly. Groups of high school students were shown a brief political interview in which the interviewer's nonverbal behavior to the interviewee was friendly or hostile. They viewed the interview in a foreign language and so could only use visual and non-verbal cues. Students who actively participated in a media literacy course were compared to a control group of students who were not enrolled in the course. Results showed that while the control group showed nonverbal media bias effect and judged the interviewee more favorably when the interviewer was friendly, this effect disappeared for the media-educated group. Media literacy students seemed to be immune to the nonverbal media bias effect, judging the interviewee similarly regardless of whether the interviewer was friendly or hostile. These findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of media literacy education programs which aim to increase elaborated information processing and increased mindfulness in responding to television news and informational programming."
2009-1518,The Effect of Relationship Characteristics on Reactions to Hurtful Messages From Romantic Partners,"The Dark Side of Relational Communication: Hurtful, Bullying, and Teasing Messages",,,,Paper,The Effect of Relationship Characteristics on Reactions to Hurtful Messages From Romantic Partners,"The Dark Side of Relational Communication: Hurtful, Bullying, and Teasing Messages","The aim of this study was to explain why people have varied reactions to hurtful messages by integrating relational communication into the relational turbulence model. Hypotheses predicted that relational turbulence would be positively associated with perceptions of dominance and disaffiliation in a hurtful interaction with a romantic partner (H1). We also predicted that perceptions of dominance and disaffiliation would result in more intense reactions to hurt, as indexed by intensity of hurt, negative emotions, and perceptions of intentionality (H2). One hundred and fifty participants rated their perceptions of hurt, negative emotions, and perceived intentionality after engaging in two five-minute conversations with their romantic partner about the participants traits or values. To evoke hurt, one partner was recruited as a confederate and was coached to be unsupportive and hurtful in one conversation with the participant. Results showed that relational turbulence positively influences perceptions of dominance, with regard to either a hurtful interaction or a conversation focused on resolving a past hurt. Furthermore, perceptions of dominance positively predicted perceptions of disaffiliation, which influenced peoples reactions to hurt, as indexed by intensity of hurt, negative emotions, and perceived intentionality."

A 2(congruity) x 2(proximity) x 2(advergame) repeated-measures experiment was used. Implicit memory was measured using a word-fragment completion task while explicit memory was measured using a recognition test. Attitude toward the brand was measured using three, seven-point attitude scales. STRTs were used to index resources available at encoding. Brand familiarity and prior game-playing experience served as moderating variables.
Results showed that when brands are centrally placed in advergames where the brand is congruent to the game content, game players explicit memory improves. When the brands are congruent to the game content, game players implicit memory improves and their attitude toward the brand tends to be more positive as well."
2009-1520,The Effects of Drug-Prevention Messages on the Accessibility of Identity-Related Constructs,Persuasive Messages (High Density),,,,Paper,The Effects of Drug-Prevention Messages on the Accessibility of Identity-Related Constructs,Persuasive Messages (High Density),"Recent theoretical work has posited that the self-system guides behavior via currently activated self-concepts. We adopt this framework to the study of persuasive health messages by examining the extent to which messages can alter the accessibility of self-concepts and of object-construals that are consistent with activated self-concepts. These issues were explored in the context of drug-prevention messages. Participants (N = 121) were exposed to one of three print-ad conditions: autonomy-themed prevention messages, health-information themed prevention messages (comparison), and informational consumer ads (control). Outcomes were reaction times to make speeded dichotomous judgments. Relative to comparison and control ads, the autonomy-themed ads were more successful at activating a self-view consistent with non-use, a view that drug use is inconsistent with autonomy, and unwillingness to use drugs."

Over 330 individuals in both geographically close and long-distance romantic relationships completed measures of equity, uncertainty (self, partner, and relational), and partners relational maintenance behaviors. Findings indicated people in equitable relationships reported more use of partner maintenance behaviors than did people in inequitable relationships. Also, people in GCRs reported greater use of partner maintenance strategy use than people in LDRs. Furthermore, compared to people in inequitable relationships, participants in equitable relationships experienced less relationship-uncertainty. Negative associations among (a) self-uncertainty, (b) partner-uncertainty, and (c) relationship-uncertainty, and partners use of maintenance behaviors were also found. Finally, analyses showed that partners maintenance strategy use strongly predicted trust, commitment, and relational satisfaction. Moreover, partner maintenance strategy use partially mediated the adverse effects of inequity and uncertainty on these indicators of relational quality."

Further, the study implements a multiple exposure methodology to determine whether repeated exposure over several days results in a strengthening of that cognitive association. It also tests a for attitudinal effects predicted by social learning theory by testing whether repeated exposure results in participants finding such content and related behaviors between adults and minors more socially acceptable."

Findings show that (a) as negotiators place greater importance on competitive goals, they use more distributive persuasion that reduces their counterparts profit, (b) employers competitive goals cause employees to use less integrative prioritizing that in turn hurts employers gains, and (c) competitive goals have an indirect, negative effect on joint profit. Although perceived importance of competitive goals varied by culture and role, culture did not moderate the associations between goals, tactics, and outcomes. Results support the assertion that cultural differences exist in larger patterns of cultural similarities."

In addition, the study aims to identify associations between different types of interactive news presentation styles and levels of satisfaction. Results indicate that use of interactive features is generally positively associated with perceived satisfaction with the exception of forums and Q&A features. Regression analysis suggests that customization features are the sole significant positive predictor of perceived satisfaction toward a news site."

Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory communication class (N=180) recalled the mediation behaviors their parents used when they were in high school as well as reported their past and current sexual behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge. The results revealed that coviewing of sexual content serves as an endorsement of the material for adolescents, restrictive mediation is best in moderate amounts, and that active mediation is most effective when it is paired with an open, conversational delivery style. The implications of this work for encouraging positive parent-child relationships and comfortable, healthy exchanges about sex are discussed."

The results of this study suggested the stepwise behavioral change mechanism from lack of awareness, perceptions formations, creating tendencies of evaluation and comparison, formation of attitudes, and into formations of behavioral intentions. Also, the tendency toward social comparison with individuals portrayed on television is a factor that clearly explains the negative impact of media standards of physical beauty. Implications and future studies are discussed."

Participants included 245 individuals who could recall their current or formal relational partners deception. Results indicated that communication efficacy mediated the association between the relational correlates and avoidance. The findings suggest that individuals satisfaction and commitment levels influence the way they perceive communication efficacy, and communication efficacy, in turn, affects their avoidance following a deception incident."
2009-1528,The Effects of Sensation Seeking on Cognitive Processing of Attack vs. Blame Antitobacco Advertisements,Messages to Moderate Youth Behavior (High Density),,,,Paper,The Effects of Sensation Seeking on Cognitive Processing of Attack vs. Blame Antitobacco Advertisements,Messages to Moderate Youth Behavior (High Density),"The purpose of the current study is to examine the effectiveness of high vs. low Message Sensation Value (MSV) Attack vs. Blame anti-tobacco advertisements. This study seeks to inform as to what overall message type (i.e., blame vs. attack) and sensation levels are likely to influence cognitive processing in high Sensation Seeking (SS) individuals  those most likely to currently smoke or smoke in the future. A 2 (Sensation Seeking  low/high) X 2 (Message Type  attack/blame) X 2 (MSV  low/high) repeated measures experimental design was used to examine processing in terms of resources allocated (STRTs) and recognition memory (SDT). Results from the current study showed that STRTs were significantly faster for low MSV messages and slower for high MSV messages. In addition, recognition was significantly better for attack versus blame messages. Overall, findings provided evidence of greater effectiveness of high MSV attack messages such as those used by the Truth campaign. This research is important in understanding what messages are most effective at increasing attention and encoding for those audience members most at risk for smoking behaviors."
2009-1529,The Effects of Single Modality Cognitive Load on the Perceived Reality of Media Narratives,Keywords in Information Systems: Narrative (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,The Effects of Single Modality Cognitive Load on the Perceived Reality of Media Narratives,Keywords in Information Systems: Narrative (High Density),"Research conducted in the field of media and perceived reality has experienced limited success. Many studies have attempted methods of cognitive loading in an effort to determine the default judgments of perceived reality (Shapiro, Shen & Weisbein, 2002; Bradley & Shapiro, 2004). Baddeley and Hitch suggest that memory can be parsed in to two separate functions via a phonological loop and a visiospatial sketchpad (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974). Previous studies may have been unsuccessful in occupying cognitive load due to this suggested switch. Preload secondary task methodology will be used (see, Grimes, 1991), in order to occupy cognitive processing. This study will employ a method using auditory preloads with varying levels of measured cognitive load. Audio tones will be used in a method recently developed by Jolicoeur (2008) based on the psychological piece, The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information (Miller, 1956). Presenting the secondary task in the same modality as the perceived reality event should prevent the proposed cognitive switching."
2009-1530,The Effects of Social Norms on Electronic Word-of-Mouth Intention: A Comparision of Three Models,cial Interactions in Virtual Groups,,,,Paper,The Effects of Social Norms on Electronic Word-of-Mouth Intention: A Comparision of Three Models,Social Interactions in Virtual Groups,"The proliferation of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) has reinvigorated research interests in identifying the factors affecting individuals motivation to share information with others. Many studies have examined how the structural properties of informal communication networks (e.g., tie strength, density) influence the likelihood of information sharing, but the psychological process underlying such structural effects has been merely speculated with little empirical evidence. Social structures influence individual behaviors mostly by forming a code of conduct or social norms. This study is an attempt to understand how individuals eWOM intention is influenced jointly by their perceived social norms in an online group situation and exchange utility. Three competing causal models  independence, complete mediation, and partial mediation -- were compared through the structural equation modeling, and the implications of the results were discussed."
2009-1531,The Effects of Social Orienting During a Lecture Delivered in a Virtual Environment,cial Interactions in Virtual Groups,,,,Paper,The Effects of Social Orienting During a Lecture Delivered in a Virtual Environment,Social Interactions in Virtual Groups,"Social orienting is the tendency to shift ones attention in the direction where others are looking. Researchers in cognitive psychology have repeatedly demonstrated that the mere image of an eye or a head pointed toward a given location automatically directs the viewers attention to that direction. The current study sought to leverage this phenomenon to manipulate participants attention to a lecture delivered within a virtual environment. The environment consisted of a conference room with a speaker and a group of other (virtual) attendees. The amount of time the other attendees spent oriented toward the speaker and the frequency of the attendees orienting movements were manipulated. Participants own orienting behaviors were measured along with their memory for the speech and their impressions of the speaker. In line with our hypotheses, participants oriented with the other attendees and stayed fixated on the speaker when the other attendees were oriented toward the speaker. Participants who experienced a high level of social presence remembered more of the speech when the other attendees spent more time oriented toward the speaker. Together these data suggest that audience orienting behaviors strongly influence the individual. Moreover, the findings speak to the power of digitally transformed social interactions within virtual environments."
2009-1532,The Effects of Terrorism News on Spanish Population: Developing a Model for Information Processing,"The Media, Terrorists, and Other Bad Guys",,,,Paper,The Effects of Terrorism News on Spanish Population: Developing a Model for Information Processing,"The Media, Terrorists, and Other Bad Guys","Based upon the results obtained from focus groups and telephone surveys, we have developed a model to explain a specific consumer behaviour pattern of media news on terrorism. This pattern seems to be characterized by (1) level of arousal (defined as level of criticism) and (2) media news consumption style (defined as visual or verbal). Sex, age, ideology and socio-geographical variables correlated with the pattern. The attribution theory and social motivation theory were used to explain how and why these processes and behaviour take place. Four types of news media consumers were suggested: explorers/adaptive (showing high/low criticism, verbal/visual preferences and cognitive in nature) and reactive/accommodators (same pattern but emotional instead of cognitive). The psychological and sociological mechanisms underlying the model were discussed in the frame of the aforementioned theories.
The model fits into the general one of information-processing that the authors have proposed elsewhere to explain the effects of terrorism news on the Spanish population."

The historic 2008 campaign featured four debates, one of which was the Vice President debate between Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and Delaware Senator Joe Biden. Traditionally, it was believed that Vice Presidential Candidates have marginal roles in the election and Vice Presidential debates may have even less effect. We conducted a study to ascertain the effects of the 0ctober 2, 2008 Vice Presidential Debate and to ascertain the association of credibility, homophily, and attraction on voting, by interviewing a random sample of voters on October 1, the night before the debate and a second sample after the debate on October 3. Results showed a statistically nonsignificant by potentially important shift toward the Biden Obama ticket during the period of the Vice Presidential Debate. Not surprisingly, voter preference was highly associated with perceived outcome of the debate. Finally, the results showed strong associations between credibility/competence, attitude homophily, and social attraction and voter preference."

Using two college students samples in the U.S. and South Korea, this study investigated the effects of CSR on perceived motivation, evaluation of social values, attitudes toward CSR and the corporation, and behavioral intentions to support Phillip Morris. The results showed that the effects of CSR activities on perceived motivation were differentiated depending on smoking status and nationality. Korean college students were likely to perceive Phillip Morris CSR than mutually beneficial than were American college students. As college students perceived motivation of CSR as mutually beneficial, they evaluated the corporation as socially responsible and showed more favorable attitudes toward CSR and the corporation. The perceived social values toward Phillip Morris CSR and attitudes toward Phillip Morris were also closely related with behavioral intentions to support Philip Morris."
2009-1535,The Effects of Using Celebrity Versus Noncelebrity Spokescharacters to Promote Healthy Versus Unhealthy Food to Children,Health Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Effects of Using Celebrity Versus Noncelebrity Spokescharacters to Promote Healthy Versus Unhealthy Food to Children,Health Communication Poster Session,"Departing from the observation that the use of licensed figures is a popular technique to promote unhealthy food to children, this papers tests whether celebrity spokes characters (as well as similar, but unknown spokes characters) are also effective in promoting healthy foods. The results of an experimental study among 6-7 year old children in Flanders (Belgium) indicate that adding a spokes character (i.e., a gnome) to a food product increases the appetite, the (reported and wished for) frequency of consumption and the (existing and future) number of parent requests for that product. This finding holds true for healthy foods (such as apples and grapes) as well as for unhealthy foods (like cookies and chocolate). The effect of the celebrity spokes character is in all cases greater than the effect of a similar (but unknown) gnome. Nevertheless, the latter is also capable of promoting the healthy and unhealthy products. These findings suggest that using licensed figures to promote healthy foods to children, might indeed be an effective strategy to change kids diets. Even the use of similar, unlicensed (read: cheaper) spokes characters could be quite fruitful."

This study asks whether a desensitization process occurs in a short-term exposure to repeated graphic violence in video games and further tests whether it would spill over into players later reactions to real life violence. Moreover, this study explores the role of a realistic input device in an attempt to better understand the effects of game features on desensitization when playing video games."
2009-1537,"The Estimation of a Corporate Crisis Communication Based on Perceived CEO's Leadership, Perceived Severity of Threats, and Perceived Opposing Public's Size",t Is Not Our Fault: Crisis Communication In Public Relations,,,,Paper,"The Estimation of a Corporate Crisis Communication Based on Perceived CEO's Leadership, Perceived Severity of Threats, and Perceived Opposing Public's Size",It Is Not Our Fault: Crisis Communication In Public Relations,"Based on the contingency theory (Cancel, Mitrook, & Cameron, 1999), this study examined whether the perception of leadership as a powerful inner organizational factor influences the outside latent publics assessment of an organizations crisis communication. This study also looked at whether the perception of the severity of threats and the opposing publics size as important external situational factors moderate the organizational stance and strategy assessment.
This study found the main effect of perceived leadership and the interaction effect of perceived leadership and perceived severity of threats on the participants estimation of organizational crisis responses. The results theoretically indicate that the contingent theoretical argument explaining the dynamics of organizational factors and situational factors in real public relations practices can also be applied when explaining the outside latent publics thought patterns predicting an organizational stance and strategy. Based on the supported main findings and some unexpected variations, this study provides implications for the contingency theory of public relations."

The contents of a total of 1969 ethical statements (1891 in the US and 78 in Korea) were reviewed. Public relations firms ethics codes in both countries showed similar patterns, though ethical statements were often aimed at advertising the agencies services to attract future clients rather than presenting legitimate codes of ethics."
2009-1539,The Ethics Gap: Why Germans Have Little Esteem and No Trust in Journalists (Top Three Faculty Paper),News User Evaluations of Professional Journalism,,,,Paper,The Ethics Gap: Why Germans Have Little Esteem and No Trust in Journalists (Top Three Faculty Paper),News User Evaluations of Professional Journalism,"In most democracies, the public reputation of journalists is on the decline. However, other than with attitudes towards parties and politicians, the concrete cognitive map that people have of journalists has received rather little attention. This paper describes the results of a representative telephone survey of the German population (N=1,054) that was designed to explore the publics perception of journalism. The paper contains a first analysis of these data. Our results confirm a rather negative public reputation of journalists, particularly concerning the professions trustworthiness and here especially among the younger population. While two thirds of respondents have esteem for journalists, only a third trust journalist. We further found large gaps between the publics expectations and the publics perceptions of journalistic goals and values, characteristics of news content, as well as journalists behavior in ethical dilemmas. In the final part of the paper we test the effects of some of these variables on trust and esteem. Our work is based on the assumption that the relationship between the people and the press deserves more research because a functioning relationship between both actors is the basis for a functioning democracy."
2009-1540,The Ethics of Fragility,Fragility: Towards a New Vocabulary of Culture and Communication,,,,Paper,The Ethics of Fragility,Fragility: Towards a New Vocabulary of Culture and Communication,"The omnipresence of the fragile is reflected most concisely in the concept of transdifference As part of a new vocabulary of culture and communication, transdifference describes that which traverses and lies beyond difference; in other words: it foregrounds those fragile moments of uncertainty, undecidability and contradiction that are the inevitable by-product of any communication processes.
Yet, one of the main challenges of rethinking the questioning in terms of fragility revolves around the paradox that a theory of the fragile must prompt equally fragile answers. Such answers must simultaneously defy attempts at consolidating fragility into solidity and permanence, but must nevertheless yield conclusions about the new realities of culture and communication. Oscillating between stability and instability, a theory of the fragile thus evokes the ethical necessity of coping with (trans)difference.
This contribution will pursue an ethical approach to theorising fragility by taking as its example media representations of (London) city cultures."
2009-1541,The EU Constitution in the News: Cross-National Analysis of News Frames in the Quality Press,Framing the news,,,,Paper,The EU Constitution in the News: Cross-National Analysis of News Frames in the Quality Press,Framing the news,"This article investigates the cross-national prevalence of five news frames in quality papers coverage of the EU Constitution. Three frames were identified in earlier studies: economic consequences, conflict, and human interest. Two additional frames were composed: power and nationalization. During the seven-month period leading up to the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon (December 2007), we analyzed 341 articles from four quality papers: Le Monde (France), De Volkskrant (The Netherlands), De Standaard (Dutch speaking community of Belgium), and Le Soir (French speaking community of Belgium). Our results show that although significant differences between newspapers were found in the amount of framing, overall they reflected a similar pattern in the adoption of the news frames. The economic consequences frame, followed by the power frame, appeared most prominently in all of the newspapers coverage. However, the conflict and nationalization frames recurred in a significantly lesser degree. These findings indicate that the meaning behind the EU Constitution as a symbol of supra-national unity led to a shift from a domesticated, conflict oriented coverage as found in previous studies to a more unified portrayal of the EU within and between the quality papers under study."
2009-1542,The Evolution of Media Effects Theory: Fifty Years of Cumulative Research,Top Four Papers in Mass Communication,,,,Paper,The Evolution of Media Effects Theory: Fifty Years of Cumulative Research,Top Four Papers in Mass Communication,"The literature of media effects is frequently characterized as a three-stage progression initially embracing a theory of strong effects followed by a repudiation of earlier work and new model of minimal effects followed by yet another repudiation and a rediscovery of strong effects. We conclude that such a characterization is both historically inaccurate and that this misrepresentation may prove to be a significant distraction and impediment to further theoretical refinement and progress. We analyze the citation patterns of 20,736 scholarly articles in five communication journals with special attention to the 200 most frequently cited papers in an effort to provide an alternative history of six fundamental and, we argue, theoretically cumulative media effects models for the period 1956 -2005."
2009-1543,The Exceptional Community: On Foreigners and Strangers,On Community,,,,Paper,The Exceptional Community: On Foreigners and Strangers,On Community,"In a passage on French immigration politics, Julia Kristeva (1991) identifies the emergence of what she calls a paradoxical community, one that is made up of foreigners who are reconciled with themselves to the extent that they recognize themselves as foreigners. To be sure, Kristeva is not interested in making a liberal humanist appeal to brotherhood. Her work helps us instead to consider the more philosophically compelling idea that foreigners do not exist externally to community; rather, they live in a zone of indistinction between inside and outside, as an exclusive inclusion necessary to the very identity of self and community. In this paper I discuss Giorgio Agambens notion of exclusive inclusion in the figure of the foreigner. I argue that the impossibility of affirming the foreigner as an external identity may be explained via the estrangement human being has from its own self-image, a foreignness within. Because self-identity is undermined by self-difference, there are no strangers quite like the strangers we are already to ourselves. Since people are strangers to one another, and are estranged also from themselves, our fears and/or fascinations about community are what terrify us about ourselvesthe foreignness at home, exclusively included within ourselves."
2009-1544,"The Extreme of the Mainstream: Fitna and ""Dangerous Islamic Media"" in the Netherlands",Dialogues and Conflicts: Points of Contact in Media Production and Policy,,,,Paper,"The Extreme of the Mainstream: Fitna and ""Dangerous Islamic Media"" in the Netherlands",Dialogues and Conflicts: Points of Contact in Media Production and Policy,"In March of 2008, the Dutch politician Geert Wilders released Fitna, a film designed to both alert Dutch citizens of the seriousness of the Islamic threat and encourage Muslim immigrants to reform themselves. The film itself calls for the banning of the Quran in the Netherlands by arguing that it causes its religious adherents to become terrorists, and that the tolerance of the intolerant immigrant leads to the Islamization of the Netherlands. This particular moment of the Trans-Atlantic conversation about the Islamic threat brings a problematic alignment to the relationship between the religious and media, liberal secular tolerance, and security. Rather than gesturing to an extreme example to make a point, this paper investigates how this rhetoric emerges from within the spectrum of Liberal and Eurocentric ideas about the history of secularism and colonialism, including the War on Terror. I will focus on the critical prospects offered by a nuanced understanding of the intersection of religion, mediation, and aesthetics of this site."
2009-1545,The Extreme Right and Its Media in Italy,Perceptions and Realities of Media Bias,,,,Paper,The Extreme Right and Its Media in Italy,Perceptions and Realities of Media Bias,"Various factors are at the origin of the resurgence of racist, neo-fascist and neo-nazi movements in Europe. Fast-paced social and cultural changes due to globalization of economics and communications; intensification of migration fluxes from former Soviet republics, North African countries, and the Balkans, into Western Europe; the process of European unification and expansion; the crisis of traditional systems of political representation, have nourished, since the early 1990s, the re-birth of far right movements and parties.
Italy is no exception. Indeed various observers are concerned that Fascism is experiencing a spectacular growth, and that the center right People of Freedoms coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi is increasingly shifting to the right. However, although the literature on the resurgence of the far right is gaining momentum, there is still little analytical and historical information on how far right groups and movements use new media technologies to their advantage. In this paper, I look at how some representative far right groups use their websites to promote a sense of community and belonging, a system for spreading information and networking among sympathizers and militants, a structure to reinforce their already strong presence in the streets and the neighborhoods, and a way to promote an image that is militant and friendly at the same time, one according to which fascism is a benevolent, pro-social force.
This research is based on an analysis of selected websites and the popular press, and on a review of existing literature."

This study explored whether these categories adequately reflect Facebook use and whether they moderate physiological indicators of emotion. Twenty-two participants navigated Facebook.com while their on-screen activity and physiological responses (skin conductance, facial EMG) was recorded. Results showed that the majority of screens encountered during Facebook use could be categorized as devoted to social browsing or social searching. Skin conductance data indicated that sympathetic activation diminished during the course of both social browsing and social searching screens. Facial EMG data indicated that both pleasantness and unpleasantness during the course of social searching screens was higher than that which occurred during social browsing screens. These results are discussed in terms of existing social networking research as well as the LC4MP and an evaluative space model of emotion."

(Attribute) Agenda Setting Studies","This study examined traditional media to social network influence at the interpretative level among 18 ideologically diverse political blogs, two traditional media entities, and the latters 11 newsroom blogs that center on politics across three diverse issues in 2007. Examining 1422 unique blog posts and 302 traditional media articles, traditional media showed little correlation with the conservative blog agenda beyond one issue, while maintaining strongly correlated agendas with left-leaning and moderate-leaning blog networks for most of the issues selected for study. More significantly, left-leaning bloggers showed a strong level of coherence within their social network at the interpretative level for most issues within this study, while right-leaning bloggers were united in their avoidance of a unified network interpretation for all but one issue. The additional finding of sharp divisions between left-leaning and right-leaning blog networks on the interpretation of most issues suggest a strong role for social influence in the creation and spreading of interpretative agendas within networked political blog environments. In this age of Web punditry, this study pinpoints that traditional medias power is no longer singular or monolithic at the level of issue interpretation."

Made in Brazil by Lloyd A. Free during February to May, 1941, this hitherto unknown study which described the Brazilians reading and radio listening habits and their opinions regarding cooperation with the United States, reveals that the beginning of mass communication research in Latin America started many years before it is usually thought, and it served to the American propagandists as a testing ground for wartime propaganda.
Apart from describing the objectives and methodology used by Lloyd A. Frees in his pioneering study, I suggest that its real importance relies on the process by which Nelson Rockefeller negotiated and was able to sell to the skeptical and contemptuous State Department the idea that scientific mass media research in Latin America could help to effectively counteract Nazi propaganda inroads and to realize the Good Neighbor Policy."

This study aims to examine the issue of virtual resources through the ways in which capital in online communities is wilfully accumulated and exchanged by players through the activities of their online personas. Pierre Bourdieus perspectives on the forms of capital are used as an analytical lens to understand and comment upon the flow of capital in the virtual realm. The study focuses mainly on the instances and boundaries of, as well as the alternatives to these systems of exchange. Twenty in-depth interviews of World of Warcraft gamers were conducted. The results show that players are able to obtain similarly structured forms of gratification in the virtual realm as they would in the real in the forms of economic, social and cultural capital. Also, employing these strategies of exchange is largely facilitated by organizational structures such as the gaming guild."

The main objective of this massive collaborative project was to map cross-national and cross-cultural differences in foreign television news. The studys approach was comparative, and included nearly 20 countries. A coordinated content analysis of two major prime-time newscasts in each country, one of a private-commercial TV station and one of a public or state-owned station, was conducted on the basis of a common codebook. The newscasts were recorded on the same days over a total time period of four weeks between January and March 2008. This paper will also reflect on important practical issues and problems in doing comparative and collaborative research."

This symbol system must be decoded for viewers to understand the content. The exploration-to-search model contrasts perceptually salient features that are attention-getting but potentially difficult to understand (e.g., rapid pace) with informative and reflective features (e.g., camera zooms). Because of the recent explosion of infant-directed media products, we examined a sample of 87 DVDs and computer games. Results supported a perceptual salience approach. Programs were rapidly paced (M = 3.10 scene changes, 5.16 character changes, and 3.06 object changes per minute) with frequent camera cuts (M = 4.90 per minute) and visual special effects (M = 5.12 per minute). The rate of reflective features like camera zooms (M = 0.61 per minute) was low. The results suggest that the media being created for infants place heavy cognitive demands on their limited processing skills."

The findings demonstrate the ways in which the Israeli media framed the war as a ""mens business"" and produced an exclusionary presentation of women that legitimizes as well as normalizes their marginal position in the context of the Israeli-Arab conflict. An analysis of the symbolic reality devised by the media exposes the gender and ethnic components of Israels inclusion (and exclusion) regime."

Central questions in this study include: What is the proportion of foreign news in comparison to domestic news coverage? Which themes and regions are in the foreground? Where are the reports placed, what length of time is allotted to them, and which formats are utilized? How are structural journalistic elements used to tell domestic and foreign stories (e.g., use of interviews, live vs. pre-recorded reports, quotes, use of maps and graphics, etc.), and how is foreign news made local?"

I argue that Lan Yu as a very successful film production undoubtedly does much to elevate awareness of the unrecognized homosexual minority in an increasingly open country like China, and it also raises awareness of the politics of sexuality that characterize media production. However, in a globalized cultural text, Lan Yu, even this awareness has been commodified; that is, the representational strategies have offered only reaffirm the dominant cultures imagination of gay identity. Finally, using Lan Yu as an example, I contend that by moving beyond dichotomous analytical schema such as the West and the Rest, global and the local, East and West and the dominant and, peripheral, Western hegemonic knowledge production is being disrupted by local cultures in unique socio-political and postcolonial contexts, meanwhile emerging into new theoretical trajectories."

Worth","The Feminine, Masculine, and Sports","The format dubbed guy talk dominates sports talk radio. Dallas-Ft. Worth station The Ticket pioneered this model and earned unprecedented audience loyalty among men. This paper examines station promotion, events and publications to demonstrate how The Ticket manufactures a visual corollary to balance the disconnected voices of talk radio. In doing so, the station gathers an audience, scattered by a decentralized metroplex, into a collected identity. However, this inclusion operates through exclusion, as both visual and audio privilege a strong heterosexual masculinity. Unlike most critics, though, I will allow for resistant readings by an audience that actively engages with the stations heavily ironic attitudes."

A large segment of this audience is female, and many of them are reaching an age where they are developing an awareness of self and comparing that self to the ideals presented in the media. While this comparison is well-documented, little research has looked specifically at the beauty ideal messages of live-action television shows specifically targeting this group. Through a content analysis of nine Disney and Nickelodeon shows, body size and beauty ideal messages were analyzed, with results suggesting that the thin, White beauty ideal that is present in adult programming is also alive and well in programming for a younger audience. Furthermore, the idea that beauty is good is reinforced through verbal messages to thin characters. These results and implications are discussed in the context of Social Comparison Theory."
2009-1558,"The Grass is Greener on This Side: Indian Journalists' Job Satisfaction, Media Freedom Rating, and Perceived Importance of Profession",Contemporary Perspectives on the Performance of the Press,,,,Paper,"The Grass is Greener on This Side: Indian Journalists' Job Satisfaction, Media Freedom Rating, and Perceived Importance of Profession",Contemporary Perspectives on the Performance of the Press,"This study reports on Indian journalists job satisfaction, rating of their media freedom, and perceived importance of their profession. The survey was conducted in 16 newsrooms in four cities in India: New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Kolkata (Calcutta). These cities represented the different geographic areas of the country, all of which differ in cultural aspects. There were 216 respondents in this convenience sample.
The study found that the respondents were highly satisfied with their job. The more work experience they had, the more satisfied they were with their jobs. Respondents also rated the media freedom in their country as above average, and they considered their profession highly important. Female respondents perceived a higher importance of their profession than their male counterparts.
Respondents were asked an open-ended question about foreign direct investment in the Indian print media. About 86 percent of respondents said that FDI would eventually bring about a positive change in the journalism profession because foreign investment would translate into better salaries, working conditions and career opportunities for journalists. All of this would lead to higher quality of newspaper output. About 72 percent of respondents said that the current media explosion in India was positive for the country.
India is the worlds largest democracy and has a burgeoning economy. Indian journalists play an important role in shaping public opinion. The contribution of this study is that it provides statistical information for a group about whom little is known because communication research in India is at a fledgling stage."

A key initiative borne out of this movement was the so-called Blue Book, a high-water mark for FCC progressive activism that mandated social responsibility obligations for broadcasters in return for their use of the public airwaves. Ultimately, red baiting tactics defeated the policy initiatives outlined in the Blue Book and the media reform movement was largely contained. The following analysis draws from previously unexamined archival materials to illuminate the resulting postwar settlement for U.S. broadcasters."
2009-1560,The Grenada Invasion and the Domestic Costs of Empire,Media Histories in Global Perspective,,,,Paper,The Grenada Invasion and the Domestic Costs of Empire,Media Histories in Global Perspective,"This paper argues that the complex crisis of legitimation currently faced by the dominant news media first came into especially stark relief at the time of the U.S. invasion of Grenada. Although the Grenada operation has largely faded from public memory, attention to this moment of imperial rejuvenation reveals a line of connection between empire and press authority (or, more exactly, lack thereof) that has a particular shape, post-Vietnam. I focus upon the first attempt at post-Vietnam press management, that which occurred in conjunction with the 1983 Grenada operation. The Grenada operation was both innovative and historically significant, an experiment that over time consolidated itself as an effective template for subsequent news management in support of empire. In this paper, I will argue that the ongoing legitimation crisis of the press and post-Vietnam press management in support of empire are powerfully intertwined."

A number of social psychological and communication theories addressing identity in intergroup and intercultural contexts will be examined, so as to explicate two basic identity constructs: identity inclusivity and identity security. It is argued that, together, these constructs constitute the core of the identity factor, which is fundamental to individual efforts to transcend group boundaries and strive for mutuality. The presentation ends with an illustration of how these two facets of identity manifest themselves in specific cases."
2009-1562,The Identity Politics of My Big Fat Greek Wedding,Discourses of Diversity in Media Production,,,,Paper,The Identity Politics of My Big Fat Greek Wedding,Discourses of Diversity in Media Production,"Cultural discourses celebrating diversity, multiculturalism, and ethnic chic have become increasingly prevalent in American society since the 1990s. One incredibly popular film celebrating an ethnic perspective on American weddings emerged at this time  My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002). Through a qualitative critical textual analysis, this project analyzes the sociocultural meanings of this film. This approach interprets the representation of the ethnic wedding through critical theories of race/ethnicity and society to better understand how non-Anglo ethnic traditions were positioned in and through mainstream American culture. The analysis highlights the racial/ethnic implications of the film and its role in contemporary American identity politics. The analysis suggests that while the ethnic identity depicted in the film is celebrated, the over-the-top representations of cultural differences also serve to construct ethnicity-as-difference as a spectacle for entertainment. The differences are thus to be enjoyed as a spectacle, innocently, without the angst of racial politics that might be evident when representing differences drawn from oppressed minorities in the U.S. today."

Three elite newspapers and two popular newspapers in Northern Belgium and the period between 1998 and 2007 serve as the case study for this investigation. In putting forward the framing concept as the persuasive element in the workings of ideology in maintaining or challenging hegemonic positions, the frame sponsorship of the scientific institutes, industry and the campaigning social movements is charted first from which ten frames are identified that serve each actors interests and beliefs. Second, data are presented from a content analysis (N=1385) with a specific focus on how different newspapers construct an ideological preferred meaning of this social conflict through a systematic selection and combination of facts, actors, sources and frames. The political-ideological consensus is found to have been under severe attack between February 1999 and April 2004, after which the hegemonic influence of news coverage is restored. Notable differences are found between the newspapers which indicate clear ideological preferences."
2009-1564,The Immersive Metaphor,Beyond Metaphors,,,,Paper,The Immersive Metaphor,Beyond Metaphors,"In my talk I argue for the immersive  enabling and embedding  character of metaphor in a threefold sense. First, in accordance with the social brain hypothesis (Robin Dunbar) and the evolution of representational skills approach (Merlin Donald) it is metaphor that enables the emergence of a complex society: metaphor immerses us in, and lets us reflect upon, our social networks. Secondly, in accordance with cognitive metaphor theory, metaphor bridges the gap between everyday experiences/perceptions and abstract concepts: conceptual processing is connected to, and embedded in, our primordial perception and activity via metaphor. Thirdly, since metaphor, i.e. cross-domain mapping, is possible due to imagery and visual representation which bears considerable immersive potential, the close relation to visual processing furnishes the feedback to everyday experiences even on the linguistic level.
In order to create an appropriate philosophical background, the talk will attempt to show that the comparison of visual and verbal processing, especially when seen in the context of certain re¬marks by Wittgenstein on analogy and grammar, reveals some crucial characteristics of language. Also, I will discuss how metaphor as a means to conceptually access novel phenomena sheds new light on the relation of science and folk theory, and of course on the learning process itself.
By way of conclusion I will refer to the role of media. Media construed as the technology of me¬diation of experiences, ideas, and knowledge, have a crucial role as to what can be expressed and disseminated. Accordingly, communications technology has a significant impact on the thought process. Recent changes (I have in mind, in particular, portable devices supplemented with multi¬media) open up the way towards a new kind of embededdness into the world of un-mediated experience."
2009-1565,The Impact of Attention on Promotional Effectiveness: The Case of Congruity Effects,Mass Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Impact of Attention on Promotional Effectiveness: The Case of Congruity Effects,Mass Communication Poster Session,An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of viewers attentional focus on recall and evaluations of commercials. A positive relationship was hypothesized between the commercials congruence with the individual viewers attentional focus and the viewers recall and evaluations of commercials. Results showed that free and cued recall and evaluations of commercials were higher when the commercial contents were congruent with the viewers attentional focus. Results of the research provide empirical support for the congruity effects and suggest implications for future advertising research and strategic planning for placing advertisements.

However, in a high-choice environment where people can easily avoid news, it is not clear whether the positive effects of news consumption will still hold. Following Priors (2007) argument that content preferences become a key predictor of political learning and participation in a high-choice environment, this study examines how content preferences and individuals media environment play a role in gaining political knowledge and vote in the Presidential election. Moreover, by using a one-source dataset which combined peoplemeter data and a telephone survey, this study attempted to see whether improved measures of preferences and media environment still explain the models that Prior proposed in his previous research. The results suggest that a news preference and an entertainment preference, though highly related, have differential effects on political learning and participation. The interaction effects of content preferences and media environment variables were found in part. This study discusses the political implications of content preferences and suggests directions for future research."

A systematic random sample of the most popular Hindi films in the sixty year period since Indias Independence (1947) was content-analyzed to examine the impact of globalization on Hindi cinema. The results provided empirical evidence that both indigenous/glocalized and exogenous/grobalized structures were significantly associated with Hindi film violence, crime and vice, and romantic elements, but in varying and often complex ways."
2009-1568,The Impact of Honor Crime Visuals,Visual Communication Studies Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Impact of Honor Crime Visuals,Visual Communication Studies Poster Session,"The suggested paper draws upon a research in progress, the empirical results of which will be featured in a poster. The present research aims at investigating how visualization influences emotional reactions to honor crimes, and whether differences in emotional reactions to honor crime visuals can be observed in people from different cultural backgrounds. The empirical study conducted to answer our research questions consists of three parts. First, in the form of a questionnaire participants knowledge about, and attitudes towards the concept of honor and honor crimes is assessed. The second part is a text-visual manipulation task in which participants are presented with six reports of honor crimes. Participants are divided into three experimental conditions. One group receives the reports without accompanying visuals, the second group receives the reports accompanied by photographs of honor crime victims, and the third group receives them accompanied by photographs of honor crime victimizers. The last part is a rank-order image classification task, in which participants are asked to order images of alleged honor crime victims according to their felt sympathy and identification with the victims. The aim of this part is to investigate whether certain characteristics of the visuals lead to higher sympathy, and can be described as iconographic features of honor crime victims. The sample includes university students from both honor and non-honor cultural backgrounds, as defined in previous researches (Fischer et al., 1999; Mosquera et al., 2002; Cohen & Vandello, 2003)."

For participants (i.e., low in PNS) who seemed to process DTCAs more carefully, brand attitudes were influenced by the presence and severity of risk information. Attitudes among high PNS participants were not influenced by risk information. Both high and low PNS participants attitudes toward the brand were influenced by global attitudes toward DTCA."
2009-1570,The Impact of Mood and Story Frame on Information Processing of News Stories,"The News: Credibility, Bias, and Mood",,,,Paper,The Impact of Mood and Story Frame on Information Processing of News Stories,"The News: Credibility, Bias, and Mood","This study examines the impact of mood (positive or negative) on processing of news stories having a dominant episodic or thematic frame. An experiment (N = 175) found individuals associative networks are altered after reading news stories. Those in a positive mood do not activate their associative networks and process news stories with an episodic or thematic frame heuristically. Individuals in a negative mood activate more nodes in their associative networks (both cognitive and affective) and bolster their associative network weights. Mood also impacts perceptions of news credibility. Those in a negative mood, reading thematically framed stories found the news sources to be more credible than those reading episodic or those in a positive mood."
2009-1571,The Impact of Perceived Media Influence on Professional Orientations: A Survey Study of Hong Kong Journalists,Journalists on Journalism,,,,Paper,The Impact of Perceived Media Influence on Professional Orientations: A Survey Study of Hong Kong Journalists,Journalists on Journalism,"This article examines journalists perceptions of media influence on citizens and politicians and the implications of such perceptions on professional orientations. Using a representative survey of Hong Kong journalists (N = 511), this study finds that perceived media influence can be a multidimensional construct. More importantly, premised on the argument that journalists professional orientation is closely tied to an understanding of the relationship between the media and their audience, perceived media influence is found to be related to emphasis on medias professional roles, recognition of the need to be cautious when criticizing others or advocating specific standpoints, as well as critical evaluation of the medias ethical performance. Implications of the findings on the studies of perceived media influence and of journalistic professionalism are discussed."
2009-1572,The Impact of the Individuals Locus of Control on Health Campaign Persuasiveness,Messages to Moderate Youth Behavior (High Density),,,,Paper,The Impact of the Individuals Locus of Control on Health Campaign Persuasiveness,Messages to Moderate Youth Behavior (High Density),"This study attempts to extend prior literature by examining the moderating role of individuals chronic locus of control on health message effectiveness. It posits that preexisting locus of control and message framing will have interaction effects on message persuasiveness. The current research used an experimental study to test this assumption in the context of obesity prevention. This experiment found that individuals with high chronic internal locus enhance behavioral intentions when they were exposed to individual responsibility messages than social responsibility messages. This observed effect only occurred when individuals were also low in chronic external locus of control. However, individuals with high chronic external locus of control were not more persuaded by social responsibility messages than by individual responsibility messages, even though they were also low in chronic internal locus of control.
Overall, this study provides some evidence in support of the need to tailor health communication messages to the individuals locus of control. It also extends research on health message framing from traditional valence framing to responsibility framing. Such a new approach has the advantage of allowing researchers to examine health issues not only at an individual level, but also at societal level. The results of this study can also have important practical implications as many todays health issues, such as smoking and binge drinking, are often discussed and interpreted in terms of both individual and social factors."
2009-1573,The Importance of Communication Factors to Safety Climate: An Exploratory Analysis,Managing Health and Illness in the Community and the Workplace,,,,Paper,The Importance of Communication Factors to Safety Climate: An Exploratory Analysis,Managing Health and Illness in the Community and the Workplace,"Although there has been widespread interest in safety climate, relatively little attention has been given to the importance of specific communication factors in this line of research. This study developed and tested communication factors in an attempt to understand their relationship with safety climate and self-reported safety behaviors. Questionnaire responses were obtained from a random sample of employees at two points in time (N= 469 at time 1 and N=645 at time 2) working in a manufacturing plant in the United States. Plant-wide injury rates, obtained from the plants safety management group, decreased over the investigation period from an average of 12.25 in the first seven months to an average of 10.05 over the last seven months (p < .05). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed three safety climate factors: perceptions of management commitment (organizational safety climate), prioritization (team safety climate), supervisory communication (team safety climate), and three safety communication climate factors: communication satisfaction, information-seeking intentions, and information expectations. After controlling for prior injury, the safety communication climate factors were significantly related to both safety climate and self-reported safety behaviors. Although the plant-level injury rate declined significantly over the course of the study, safety climate factors remained static while safety communication climate improved, signifying that safety communication climate can be improved more rapidly than safety climate.. Evidence from this study indicates that health communication scholars and safety practitioners should pay close attention to local interaction about safety, suggesting that communication is an important factor in helping organizations improve safety."
2009-1574,The Incommunicable Community,On Community,,,,Paper,The Incommunicable Community,On Community,"The purpose of this paper is to rethink the relation between communication and community. The roots of this relation can be traced back to the philosophy of Hegel and Rousseau, and more recently in communication thought to Dewey, Cooley, Habermas and Carey. While divergent in their philosophical perspectives, these accounts envision community in terms of synthesis, commonality and consensusand communication as either the precondition for or the ultimate objective of the production of such a community. Thus the common Latin root communis (common, public, general, shared by many) has come to denote a community of sameness. Drawing on the work of Jean-Luc Nancy and Emmanuel Levinas, I will propose a different conception of the communication-community relation, one that is based on difference rather than sameness and commonality. My main point is that difference does not imply a threat to communityto the contrary, it is the basis for community. Following Nancy and Levinas, community will be cast as precisely that which escapes the ontology of community and resists the totalizing and essentializing notions of community. Finally, a few remarks will be offered about the relevance of such re-conceptualization for the study of communication and culture."

This study aimed to gain a greater understanding of how transnational crises evolve as well as the best means of testing and further developing CNCS theory. To test the proposed hypotheses, a 2x 2 factorial design was developed and applied to analyze the dependent measures of participant attitudes and behavioral intentions. The results indicate that the type of crisis faced by a TNC significantly influences potential customers attitudes and behavioral intentions."
2009-1576,The Influence of Blog Popularity Factor on the Blogger's Sociopolitical Participation,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,,,,Paper,The Influence of Blog Popularity Factor on the Blogger's Sociopolitical Participation,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,"Bloggers publish, create, and distribute their own text, images, and video-clips though blogs. Despite its popularity and astronomical growth of blogosphere, little scientific research has been conducted to elucidate influential bloggers online and their socio-political participation. In particular, while blogging has been spotlighted as a new form of participatory journalism, only a few key blogs seem to play crucial role in political discourse in blogosphere. However, there are few researches whether famous blogs owners, bloggers, are active political actors or not. In order to assess bloggers potential in political communication, two factors need to be accounted for; (1) identification of famous bloggers who have well-known blogs and (2) their socio-political participation. Based on such rationale, this study attempts to uncover the famous bloggers among bloggers based on two categorized variables (blog visitors and blogrolls) and their political nature, if they are isolated cyber-geeks or political actors in on and off-line. For this purpose, the researchers conducted structured online surveys with 807 participants and analyzed the data with t-Test and Hierarchical Regression Analysis method. The results demonstrate that the famous bloggers have higher level of socio-political participation than unpopular bloggers do. Furthermore this research reveals the causality that the famousness of bloggers influences on their socio-political participation in controlling their media use, political interest, and socio-demographic variables. Based on the political profiles of famous bloggers generated from this empirical survey, present study argues that, depending on their famousness, popular bloggers can be influential as political actors."

This study uses a representative telephone survey of Upstate New York residents to examine the influence that environmental values and media use have on predispositions for the public to engage in wildlife management decision making processes. Placing the examination within the social amplification of risk framework, this study finds that environmental values directly impact concern for management, health risk perceptions, media use, and predispositions for engagement. Media use, in turn, impacts citizen participation by amplifying risk perceptions and concern for management while increasing the publics predisposition to participate in decision-making processes. The studys implications for how the social amplification of risk framework can be used to analyze citizen participation and how risk practitioners may encourage citizen engagement are discussed."

In Study 1, explicit and implicit attitudes were measured online and participants later watched Remember the Titans and made judgments about the film. Explicitly measured attitudes influenced participants global reactions to the film and interpretations of events within the film. In Study 2, participants completed explicit and implicit measures in the lab and one week later participants watched Rosewood or a control film, made judgments about the film, and completed explicit and implicit measures for a second time. Implicitly measured attitudes influenced interpretation of some events within the film. Additionally, participants who viewed Rosewood showed less implicitly measured prejudice, more pro-black attitudes, and less explicitly measured prejudice after viewing the film."

This investigation makes sense of the mixed findings from previous research by controlling for previously overlooked third-variables affecting the relationship between agenda-building efforts, media salience, and one particular dimension of reputation: organizational prominence. The study used content analysis and secondary analysis of a nationwide public opinion poll (N=5,661) and controlled for firms previous years level of prominence. The results indicate that media salience increased organizational prominence, while news originating from the firms themselves decreased organizational prominence. Thus, news from the media had a more positive effect on organizational prominence than news coming directly from the firms. The study also found that relationship between firms agenda-building efforts and organizational prominence was mediated by the firms degree of media salience. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed and recommendations are made for future research."
2009-1580,The Influence of Incidental Discrete Emotions on Health Risk Perceptions and Persuasion,The Best of Information Systems,,,,Paper,The Influence of Incidental Discrete Emotions on Health Risk Perceptions and Persuasion,The Best of Information Systems,"This research examines the effects of two negative incidental discrete emotions  fear and anger  on health risk perception (i.e., perceived susceptibility to a health problem) and persuasion. In two experiments, fear and anger were induced before participants were exposed to a public service announcement that advocated sun protection behaviors to prevent skin cancer (experiment 1) or flossing to prevent gum diseases (experiment 2). It was found that fearful participants perceived greater susceptibility to the health risks than angry participants, as well as those who were in a neural affective state. Angry participants did not differ from those in a neutral affective state in terms of perceived susceptibility. There was evidence, albeit limited, that fear exerted an indirect effect on attitude toward the recommended health behavior and intention to perform the health behavior through health risk perception. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed."
2009-1581,The Influence of Morality Subcultures on the Acceptance and Appeal of Violence,Top Four Papers in Mass Communication,,,,Paper,The Influence of Morality Subcultures on the Acceptance and Appeal of Violence,Top Four Papers in Mass Communication,"Two studies examine how features of morality subcultures predict the acceptance and appeal of violent media. Study 1 used individual difference variables such as religiosity, trait aggression, and gender to represent morality subcultures in an attempt to predict the acceptance of violence in short scenarios. Study 2 used five domain-specific moral modules from Haidts moral foundations theory (MFT) to predict both perceptions of violence and its appeal. In Study 1, the individual difference variable (e.g., religious, non-religious) was the within subjects factor in a 2 X 2 X 2 mixed experimental design that varied perpetrator disposition (positive, negative) and motive (justified, unjustified). After reading one of four conflict scenarios, participants rated the acceptability of 15 different potential resolutions that varied in level of violent reprisal. In Study 2, reports regression analysis in which moral module scores replace individual difference scores as exogenous variables in attempts to predict perceptions of violent content as graphic and just in addition to the contents appeal. The results offer initial support to contentions that membership in identifiable morality subcultures can systematically vary the perceptions of and appeal of violent drama."

The current study utilizes Lang's Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP) to examine Attack vs. Blame and high vs. low Message Sensation Value (MSV) anti-tobacco ads as well as individual Motivation Activation as a possible influence of what parts of incoming information are encoded and stored. A total of 226 participants took part in a 2 (Message Type: Blame/Attack) X 2 (Message Sensation Value: low/high) X 2 (Positivity Offset: low/high) X 2 (Negativity Bias: low/high) repeated measures experiment. Findings suggest that high MSV Attack ads - like those used by the national Truth campaign - are more effective than Blame ads in terms of encoding (STRTs, Response Latency, Recognition Memory)."
2009-1583,The Influence of News Sources on Health News Content: Does Localization Really Matter?,Public Relations Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Influence of News Sources on Health News Content: Does Localization Really Matter?,Public Relations Poster Session,"This study examined the relationship between public relations practitioners use of framing in news releases and its impact on local news journalists coverage in a health care context. The study involved a content analysis of 82 news releases and 328 items of newspaper articles from 1998 to 2007, grounded in frame theory. The findings suggest that journalists in a region with high obesity prevalence are more likely to be influenced by practitioners use of framing in information subsidies than those in a region with low occurrence. The study also reveals that, regardless of the level of obesity in a region, local news stories about obesity-related issues were packaged in similar ways. Limitations and suggestions for future studies were discussed."

This study examines the interplay among anti-marijuana public service announcements (PSAs) and message postings from other viewers about those videos as presented on YouTube. Following known effects of message sensation value reactions to PSAs, this research explored the portability of influence factors from PSAs to comments by varying messages with respect to language intensity and comment valence. Results show that subjects sensation seeking characteristics interact with the supportive or derisive nature of comments to affect PSA evaluations, and that message content and intensity interacted with participants sensation seeking to affect their perceptions of comment posters credibility, homophily, and identification."

Nonetheless, little is known about the effects of avatar race on attitudes and behaviors. We conducted a study to determine how peoples implicit racial bias is affected by the race of their avatar in an immersive virtual environment (IVE). Our results indicate that avatar race affects users not only in digital spaces: the race of a users avatar in an IVE significantly affected automatic racial bias outside the IVE. These findings have important implications for strategies to reduce racial prejudice and provide new insights into the flexibility of racial identity and racial attitudes afforded by virtual technologies."

This paper builds on the previous work (Lang, 1995) and extends it by applying the updated limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) which, in addition to considering the influence of structural features, also considers the influence of emotion on message processing, and contemplates these variables dynamically over time. In order to measure these influences this study will measure audio/video redundancy, audio complexity, video complexity, and emotional content for every four seconds of a 35 minute news broadcast. Secondary task reaction times (STRTs) will be used to measure resources available at encoding and visual and audio recognition tests will be used to assess encoding. This will allow us to examine available resources and encoding overtime at various levels of the independent variables."
2009-1587,The Influence of Television Fiction on Real World Victim Sympathy: The Roles of Narrative Engagement and Counterarguing,Narrative Persuasion,,,,Paper,The Influence of Television Fiction on Real World Victim Sympathy: The Roles of Narrative Engagement and Counterarguing,Narrative Persuasion,"Abstract

Based on a mental models approach to narrative processing and persuasion this study explores the influence of focusing viewers attention on either factors central to processing narratives  time, location, and characters  or on flaws and inconsistencies in the narrative.
Participants watched one of two crime-drama programs under one of two experimental conditions intended decrease or increase viewer engagement. In one condition viewers searched for flaws while viewing. In another condition they monitored scene changes and characters.
Results indicate that relative to each other monitoring scenes increases engagement while searching for flaws decreases engagement. However this effect was observed only with emotional engagement and narrative understanding dimensions of overall engagement, and only with a program that lacked a sympathetic protagonist. These results were not found when the program featured a well-developed victim as a main character. When the program did feature a well-developed sympathetic victim, audience members sympathy for victims of violence increased from pre- to post-viewing measures and was positively related to engagement during the viewing experience. Also, viewers watching a program in which they could identify fewer flaws found the program more engaging."
2009-1588,The Influence of Youth MTV/VH1 Viewership on Cigarette Use and Association with Smoking Peers,"Media and Interpersonal Influences on Adolescent Health Cognitions, Intentions, and Behaviors",,,,Paper,The Influence of Youth MTV/VH1 Viewership on Cigarette Use and Association with Smoking Peers,"Media and Interpersonal Influences on Adolescent Health Cognitions, Intentions, and Behaviors","Prior research has found strong evidence of a prospective association between R movie exposure and teen smoking. The present study examines such prospective associations between viewing of music video channels on television (e.g., MTV and VH-1) and increasing trajectories of smoking and association with smoking peers. A nationally-representative data set of U.S. adolescents and their parents was used in these parallel process latent growth analyses. Results showed that baseline MTV/VH-1 viewing robustly predicted increasing trajectories of smoking and of smoking peers, after application of a variety of controls including parent reports of monitoring behavior. Growth parameters of music video viewership and smoking behavior were not significantly correlated. The results are interpreted, in combination with related results from other studies, as consistent with the argument from social development theory and the reinforcing spirals model that such media use serves as a means of developing emergent adolescent social identities consistent with smoking and other risk behaviors."

In five separate assignments students were required to articulate their awareness of a gap in their knowledge universe and how they resolved this gap. The goal of the research project was to develop a relational view of information literacy based on how graduate students conceptualize and experience their information environment.
2009-1590,"The Information Processing of Political Advertisements: Attitude Accessibility, Psychological Processing, and Party Affiliation",Keywords in Information Systems: Attitudes (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,"The Information Processing of Political Advertisements: Attitude Accessibility, Psychological Processing, and Party Affiliation",Keywords in Information Systems: Attitudes (High Density),"This study attempts to explore how people respond to political attack ads. Specifically, we have 2 objectives: 1) to explore how cognitive and emotional factors that underlie peoples evaluations of political candidates influence processing of political ads, and 2) correlate physiological indicators of emotional response with previously recorded continuous response measures of message evaluation, collected from a nationwide sample by a commercial research company. In this study, we will first measure viewers attitude accessibility about both candidates running for president in 2008, Senators Barack Obama and John McCain. Then viewers will watch a series of ads that attack the opposing candidate. During viewing, we will measure four channels of psychophysiological response: heart rate, skin conductance, orbicularis oculi, and corrugator supercilii. The primary research questions are how do chronically accessible attitudes impact how political attack ads are cognitively and emotionally processed, and how do these responses inform continuous response data? The proposed study can contribute to a better understanding of how attitudes might dynamically shape cognitive/emotional processing of media messages."

This research, informed in part by Dervins Sense-Making Methodology, employs a variety of contextualist perspectives from information use, communication, and sociological perspectives. The aim is to make a claim for the distinctive aspects of the chronic illness experience that shape information needs, seeking, and use in this context."

Among other things, it will discuss the inherent arbitrariness of the news versus entertainment distinction, suggesting a move from stiff or false dichotomies to conceptual gradualism. Despite the seeming naturalness of the distinction between news and en-tertainment media, it is remarkably difficult to identify the characteristics upon which this dis-tinction is based. In fact, it is difficult - or impossible - to articulate a theoretically useful defini-tion of this distinction. The opposite of news is not entertainment, as the news is often diver-sionary or amusing (the definition of entertainment) and what is called entertainment is often neither of these things."
2009-1593,"The Innovation Imperative: How the Managerial Discourse of Creativity/Innovation Shapes Worldviews, Organizing Practices, and Work-Based Identities in the Knowledge Economy",Top 3 Papers in Organizational Communication,,,,Paper,"The Innovation Imperative: How the Managerial Discourse of Creativity/Innovation Shapes Worldviews, Organizing Practices, and Work-Based Identities in the Knowledge Economy",Top 3 Papers in Organizational Communication,"This paper examines creativity and innovation as a large-scale discursive formation that constitutes worldviews, organizing practices and social identities. I highlight how the discourse constructs an innovation imperative which mandates that companies compete on the terrain of constant innovation or risk survival. Central to the imperative is the emotional logic of survival/growth, which works rhetorically by circulating the emotional currency of fear and possibility. I argue that the imperative is part of a larger narrative of promise and peril, in which creativity and innovation represent the promise of a new age but also the peril of increasing global competition. It is this dominant construction that animates the formation and gives it its rhetorical force within the business world."
2009-1594,The Institutionalisation of Communications Research in England and Its Relationship to the Media Industry: The Case of the Centre for Mass Communications Research at the University of Leicester,Forging a Coherent Disciplinary Identity: Readings in the History of British Communication Studies,,,,Paper,The Institutionalisation of Communications Research in England and Its Relationship to the Media Industry: The Case of the Centre for Mass Communications Research at the University of Leicester,Forging a Coherent Disciplinary Identity: Readings in the History of British Communication Studies,"The paper will examine the establishment of what was the first centre
in academic research in England dedicated to the study of the mass
media, namely, the Centre for Mass Communications at the University of
Leicester under the Directorship of James Halloran.

The paper will show how the Centre was created out of government
concerns with the effects of violence on television on viewers. This
will be briefly contrasted with the situation of the establishment of
communications research by Paul Lazarsfeld, first at Princeton
University then later at Columbia University, funded by Rockefeller
Foundation grant to study radio. The Foundations concern was to improve
the cultural performance of radio, which contrasts most strongly with
the negative concerns surrounding the start up of communications
research in England. .

The paper will argue that the manner of the founding of the Liecester
Centre as a pure research institute attached to government interests led
it from the very beginning to place a high value on administrative
research. It will show, how, as the Centre grew, it came to depend more
and more, in almost similar fashion to Lazarsfelds Bureau of Applied
Social Research at Columbia, on agencies external to the university for
financial support. This dependency on industry money and by extension
the value placed on administrative research by Halloran will be shown to
have resulted in Halloran dislike of critical cultural studies that was
developing under Stuart Hall at Birmingham, and equally on Halls part
dislike of the administrative research undertaken at Leicester.

The paper will conclude by raising questions, drawn from issues that
emerged during the founding period, of the role and function of
communications research as it relates to the media, government and
government agencies."

In this paper, we examine the relationship between peer and social influence (e.g., parents, step-parents, and guardian) on the usage of a very specific application with a specific age group of people. To test this relationship, we apply the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. A survey with 300 respondents shows that the effect of peer influence on intention is as strong as the effect of social influence on intention to use instant messaging. This study also highlights that examining different technologies or applications with the theory may yield different results. The results contribute to theoretical understanding and have practical applications."
2009-1596,The Interactive Effects of Visual Images and Message Framing on Health-Related Persuasion,Persuasive Messages (High Density),,,,Paper,The Interactive Effects of Visual Images and Message Framing on Health-Related Persuasion,Persuasive Messages (High Density),"This study examined the effectiveness of visual images and message frames in communicating health risks. An experiment (N = 95) was conducted to explore the effectiveness of message frames and message formats on persuasiveness (attitude toward the advocacy, perceived effectiveness, and behavioral intention), fear, and cognitive processing by utilizing a 2 (message frame: gain vs. loss) × 2 (message format: verbal vs. visual) × 2 (health issues: dental flossing and sunscreen use) mixed factorial design. Results indicate that significant message frames × message formats interaction effects on fear and persuasiveness were found with the negative visual conditions generating more fear and persuasiveness. The effects of the message formats on cognitive processing were not significant. Mediation tests showed that fear mediated the relationship between message format and persuasion. These results suggest that increased fear as generated by negative visual images led to more persuasion rather than increased processing of the messages."
2009-1597,The Interactive Newspaper: Online Multimedia and the Framing of the Iraq War (Top Three Graduate Student Paper),Framing the news,,,,Paper,The Interactive Newspaper: Online Multimedia and the Framing of the Iraq War (Top Three Graduate Student Paper),Framing the news,"Online multimedia platforms have allowed news organizations to cover the Iraq War in a more vivid and interactive manner than previous conflicts. This study examined the utilization of multimedia story types by U.S. newspaper Web sites in covering the Iraq War in 2007, and its role in framing aspects of the War. A total of 201 photo galleries, audio slideshows, interactive graphics, and interactive packages were analyzed from the 100 most-visited U.S. newspaper sites. Dominant textual and visual frames were coded for each story, along with framing dimensions including main subject, time and space.

The study concluded that human interest framing dominated multimedia coverage, although the extent of such framing differed between multimedia story types. While there were no significant differences in framing along story platform, photo galleries and slideshows constituted a majority of the sample. 72 percent of stories utilized a human interest textual frame, and 81.1 percent of stories featured a human interest visual frame. Multimedia coverage of the war primarily told the stories of individual U.S. stories and their families."
2009-1598,The International Network Structure of News Media: An Analysis of Hyperlinks Usage in News Websites Worldwide,Theory Development in International Communication,,,,Paper,The International Network Structure of News Media: An Analysis of Hyperlinks Usage in News Websites Worldwide,Theory Development in International Communication,"This study takes a network approach to examining international communication. Considering the world system theory as a network theory and bridging out to other network literature, such as of the preferential attachment theorem, the structure of the international network created by news media is examined. The use of external hyperlinks was studied in 6,298 foreign stories in 20 languages from 223 news websites in 73 countries over one composite week in November 2007. As the network approach suggests, Internet-empowered international communication remained hierarchical, without regard to the egalitarian potential of the technology. Information flows from a handful of core countries to the rest of the world. Furthermore, news media preferred linking to established organizations, such as other news media and governmental organizations, over grassroots sources such as blogs. This study concludes that although Internet technology is egalitarian, the communication networks still follow offline traditional hierarchical structures."
2009-1599,The Internet and News: Changes in Content on Newspaper Websites,Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Internet and News: Changes in Content on Newspaper Websites,Political Communication Poster Session,"Journalists justify their professional practice as a service that informs the citizenry necessary for democracy, but trends over the last century, since the rise of professional aspirations among journalists, have involved a steady move away from textual practices of current event coverage centered on citizens and nearby places and toward journalists own opinions of more distant issues. But the rise of the internet, in direct competition with print news, has accompanied several shifts in the news journalists produce. A content analysis for three mainstream U.S. newspaper web sites in 2005 continues a project that has gathered measurements for the same newspapers since the 1890s and replicates a 2001 study, when the papers had established a presence online. On one hand, politics, as a core topic in public-spirited journalism, has continued the older trends for the who,what, when,and wherein story content: toward relatively long, analytical stories with explanations from officials and groups and references to other time periods and more distant places. On the other hand, accident stories typify the new, emergent news: short, less analytical, event-centered coverage linked to individuals, other current happenings, and an especially local focus. On their web editions, the larger, wealthier news organization tended toward the older news, but the smaller or less profitable organizations moved toward the new kind of news. The focus on current events and local politics may be salutary for the informed citizenry, but the loss of context for events makes it unclear whether the impact of internet has been entirely positive."
2009-1600,The Internet and the Visibility of Oppression in Nondemocratic States: The Online Exposure of Human Rights Violations and Other Repressive Acts,The Internet and Politics,,,,Paper,The Internet and the Visibility of Oppression in Nondemocratic States: The Online Exposure of Human Rights Violations and Other Repressive Acts,The Internet and Politics,"The oppressive acts of non-democratic states have never been so visible. Whereas once transgressions of international norms by non-democratic states were exposed intermittently via smuggled film or video, or the testament of escaped dissidents, now such material is routinely posted online; visible to a growing audience of Net users. This article suggests that the emergence of the Web has not only provided new opportunities for a range of actors to publicize a variety of abuses but also that together, the blogs and websites of these actors form a new interconnected space which documents and publicizes repressive acts committed by authoritarian states. These interconnected websites and blogs form a record of the actions of oppressive states which can be easily accessed by an international bystander audience that increasingly takes transgressions of international norms seriously and takes action in response. The article highlights the results of a study which looks at the online exposure of human rights and other abuses by the regimes in Burma and Zimbabwe."

Unfortunately they sometimes make the decision about appropriate adaptations based on stereotypes of other individuals rather than their actual communication needs. This presentation reviews research documenting the ways in which social stereotypes of aging influence our communicative choices in both intergenerational and intragenerational interactions. As the research shows, those influences are reflected in language, message structure, and paralinguistics. Further, data will be presented revealing that these choices often occur automatically in interaction, reflecting not only stereotypes but also communicators age identity. Implications of this research for the study of interpersonal communication in family and organizational contexts will be outlined."

However, in the advanced sphere of not only mediated but intersubjective transnational communication, the interview has gained a new quite complex contextualizing role. I argue that in transnational comparative research, the interview not only relates empirical results to lifeworld ontologies but should rather aim to discursively reflect culturally specific phenomenologies of similarity and difference. The first part of the paper will critically reflect on the methodological positioning of the interview in transnational comparative media research in a historical and contemporary research context. The second part will suggest a conceptual approach based on hermeneutic phenomenology and critical theory."

However, it also provided an unprecedented set of challenges. On one hand, no single newsmaker has appeared on TDS more often than John McCain, who for years had been, in the words of Stephen Colbert, a friend of the show. On the other, audiences were hesitant to laugh at Barack Obamas expense and largely rejected Jon Stewarts efforts to make fun of him. All of that came as The Daily Show had become widely accepted by many as a serious source of political information, Jon Stewart had become a major celebrity, and the program was attracting its largest audience ever. Beginning from within that context, I explore the ways in which The Daily Show interpreted and critiqued the campaign, negotiating the tension between satire as an inherently oppositional form of discourse and its increasing centrality in the public political conversation.

Besides the model of advocate-journalist, another form is civic advocacy journalism. It refers to sourcing strategies by organized groups to influence news reporting and affect public policies. It belongs to forms of civic mobilization that seek to increase the visibility of political and social issues, and make political institutions (including the press) more responsive to a range of citizens concerns. From environmental to human rights groups, a host of civic organizations aim to raise awareness, generate public debate, influence public opinion and decision-makers, and promote policy and programmatic changes. The increased importance of civic advocacy journalism puts in evidence a growing consciousness among civic groups about the need to affect news content as part of their broad efforts to promote social and political change. Examining recent experiences in advocacy journalism from Latin America, this paper examines similarities and differences between the journalist and the civic models, and discusses their significance for journalistic practice and democracy."

This paper reformulates aspects of Habermas's model to address the undertheorization of power in the model as well as to understand systematic distortion and questions of culture, difference, disagreement and misrecognition in the public sphere. Habermas allows for systematic distortion of communication in the public sphere, but then does not explain how misrecognition of communicative speech acts takes place in a model in which knowledge and communication are fully rationalized. Moreover, the model does not fully explain how, if communication is based in rational language, incommensurability and unintelligibility in communication in the public sphere occur. While retaining Habermas's theory of communicative action as based in rational language and universal pragmatics, the model should be reformulated to incorporate other aspects of communication and language and to better understand the influence of ""irrational"" or ""pre-reflexive"" lifeworld elements on the ""rational"" communicative action in the public sphere. Conceptualizing the lifeworld formally as lifeworlds allows us to understand how claims in the communicative public sphere are grounded in different cultural-linguistic sets in the pre-reflexive lifeworld, leading to unintelligibility and incommensurability of claims in the public sphere."

Lawrence. This study analyzes the popular American and British conceptions of the Islamic world reflected in Thomass adventure story, which has been called one of the most powerful orientalist images ever created. Part one of the four-part study describes Thomass career, while part two reviews the different understandings that Lawrence biographers have given for Thomass role. Part three examines the ways that Edward Saids orientalist critique of Lawrence has been extended to address the Thomas portrayal. This study adds to the critique, but also weighs alternatives to Saidian interpretations. Finally, the fourth section places Thomas within the context of American media and cultural history, bringing to light a question about his role as correspondent, propagandist and Middle East mythmaker that is especially resonant today."

Findings From a Multinational Study on Leading Online Newspapers UGC Practices,,,,Paper,The Market Logic of User-Generated Content,The Decline of the Gatekeeper? Findings From a Multinational Study on Leading Online Newspapers UGC Practices,"The presentation discusses the economic forces behind the idea of participatory journalism. The market economy of the media industry  and the related search for more efficient production  has been one of the main driving forces behind innovations in journalism, and at least in part, this seems to be true for participatory journalism and UGC, too. Based on the theoretical ideas of political economy applied to communication, we will discuss this sometimes-hidden market logic behind UGC.
Several chief editors and online journalists stated in our interviews that UGC is a tool to magically produce journalistic content (as one interviewee put it)  without the need to employ or even pay the producers of the content. So while in the public debate, UGC is mostly embraced because of its function for the democratization of journalism, many professional journalists reinterpret it differently, as a way to reduce costs and make their work (and especially researching material) easier. Some others fear that user-generated content will lead to layoffs of full-time journalists and perceive this as the threat to their profession. This presentation attempts to explore participatory journalism as torn between the demands of a democratic role in society on the one hand and the sphere of (economic) news production on the other hand."

The authors propose a critical test of a neoconservative view which laments a modern crisis of masculinity and which posits media as a villain in this crisis and religion, particularly conservative religion, as the savior. The paper pursues a line of inquiry suggested by Gauntlett (2002) and Hoover (2006) with the hope of developing clearer ideas of how men make gendered narratives of self-understanding and presentation out of their media lives. While other dimensions, including questions of religion, spirituality, citizenship, and civic engagement were also addressed in the interviews, our primary focus here will be on the role of the media in these regards."
2009-1612,The Mediation of Vulnerability: Towards a Postemotional Humanitarian Sensibility,Mediation and Emotion,,,,Paper,The Mediation of Vulnerability: Towards a Postemotional Humanitarian Sensibility,Mediation and Emotion,"In this paper, I draw on a definition of mediation as the technological articulation of semiotic resources (language, image, sound) that, in de-territorializing meaning and experience, poses the problem of agency as a problem of action at a distance (Chouliaraki 2006; 2008). My empirical focus is humanitarian appeals as a genre of mediation that traditionally configures specific forms of action at a distance based on the grand emotions of pity: indignation and protest or empathy and charity (Boltanski 1999). I explore contemporary examples of this genre of mediation in order to show how they articulate the semiotics of vulnerability and construe moral agency towards vulnerable others. I conclude that an emerging tendency in the mediation of humanitarian appeals is to break with traditional registers of pity and to privilege a light-touch and low-intensity form of agency, no longer inspired by grand emotion or intellectual vision but momentarily engaging us in practices of playful consumerism."

What should parents know and do about the TV, video games, iPods, and the Internet in which their children are immersed? Cultural criticism of media and how we use them has polarized into pro- and anti-media debates that generate more heat than light, so many parents, teachers, and others who work with children just give up. But how do we answer parents questions about whether the media contribute to obesity, bullying, substance use, or sexual risk behaviors? I will discuss our experience at CMCH in translating the substantial scientific evidence to media professionals and to parents in a way that makes sense and is useful to them, yet is not sensationalized, moralized or polarized. Different strategies of informing the audience employed by CMCH will be presented and discussed."

Prescriptive advice about meeting facilitation is widespread, but scholarly work that considers meetings as process and product of organizational phenomena is rare. When meetings have received empirical attention, they have often been explored indirectly as a setting for the collection of data on some other topic (e.g., concertive control studies) and/or as an experimental task (e.g., studies of group role development). This paper synthesizes research from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical domains to develop a rationale for why meetings are a worthy organizational research topic in and of themselves. It concludes by presenting an agenda for future research."

Scholars have explored how younger teens use the mobile phone to create their external social networks from home. However, a gap remains in understanding how older teens use the mobile phone as a tool for continuing socialization relative to their family. A survey questionnaire was designed to assess motivations of college students who use the mobile phone to connect with family and friends. 514 participants completed the survey. In findings, the mobile phone is helpful for students to gain socialization skills, coordinate with their families, and remain vibrant participants in a social network. The research shows that contrary to initial expectations that the mobile phone would lead to isolation and independence of young people from their families. The mobile phone seems to increase the involvement and socialization of students with their families in this study."

That the Internet provides modes for initiating and managing relationships is a fact (see Duck, 2008). More and more new applications come into being for the primary purpose of gathering and sharing personal information to friends and acquaintances, to discover and appraise possible social partners, and to maintain relationships. As a result of these new applications, people are able to gather not just more, but different kinds of information about others than the Internet, or other conversational means, formerly allowed. Not long ago, the interpersonal information people exchanged online was verbal (typed), and under the relatively complete control of the sender: What you said about yourself, explicitly or implicitly, was reflected in your email, your discussion-board postings, or your chat room comments. The early World Wide Web added more modalitiesphotos and linkingand although control remained with the page author, the effects of additional visual information produced complex effects on impressions and relations. As the Internet has developed, more information about people becomes available through involuntary sourcesdatabase archives of past behavioral traces and third-party commentsthat further complicate issues of control and the impact of information. The manner in which people use these archives and socially-shared commenting systems can be understood conceptually by mapping their actions and online resources to a model of Internet information seeking strategies. This manuscript examines recent models, findings, and promising new research directions related to the way people seek and share interpersonal information via the Internet. It will attempt to illuminate that social information-seeking phenomena (seeking personal, interpersonal, and descriptive information about other people) via the Internet sometimes results in counter-intuitive effects on basic impressions and evaluations of others. These ironic effects of more information, particularly the influence of photos, raise challenges for traditional models of computer-mediated communication, and add interesting new boundaries to the model of hyperpersonal communication in online settings. This manuscript further examines a recent model of online information seeking that expands the traditional typology of information seeking strategies, and encompasses new applications like search engines, databases, and social networking sites. Finally, it examines new concepts and new directions in research premised on the notion that the Internet now often presents multiple information sourcesinformation by target people and information about target people left by othersand how these developments, too, may affect social information seeking and social information processing on the Internet."

It focuses on the transnational and diplomatic aspects of the controversy, specifically, framing of the problem by the Organization of Islamic Conference and the Arab League, and its handling by the United Nations. It was found that the new right of respect for religion, that was created by the UN in the wake of the cartoons controversy, contravenes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
2009-1618,"The Moral Politics of Censorship: Family Communication Patterns, Political Ideology, and Support for Censorship",Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,"The Moral Politics of Censorship: Family Communication Patterns, Political Ideology, and Support for Censorship",Political Communication Poster Session,"Differences in political ideology seem to be increasingly stark . In order to better understand how communication inputs may influence to political ideology, and how political ideology may influence communication-relevant attitudinal outcomes, I examine Lakoffs (2002) moral politics hypothesis, family communication patterns, and support for censorship. Results show some support for Lakoffs typology, but it is not the best description of different familial-ideological positions identified. Communication in the family of origin that encourages conformity and deference to parental authority tends to be associated with more conservative ideological self-identification, which in turn tends to be associated with greater support for censorship. This study adds to the literature by providing empirical evidence regarding Lakoffs arguments, further support for the proposition that greater conservatism tends to be associated with greater support for censorship, and explanation for why that relationship exists."
2009-1619,The More Things Change: The Dynamics of Local Television Affiliates,The Consequences of Postnetwork Television Beyond Prime Time,,,,Paper,The More Things Change: The Dynamics of Local Television Affiliates,The Consequences of Postnetwork Television Beyond Prime Time,"This paper examines the contemporary dynamics of local television as defined by a range of contradictions and ambiguities: between economic expansion and contraction, between national (even global) reach and local commitment, and between autonomy and centralization. These contradictions largely define the post network era in electronic media, and a close examination of these dynamics in operation at the local level provides a useful model for media scholars to understand the changes taking place in the media landscape writ large. This paper offers a detailed account of economic, technological, and regulatory developments that offer opportunities but also pose threats for local television affiliates, which are struggling to reinvent themselves within the context of rapid institutional ferment. The conclusions of this paper point the way for media scholars and media professionals alike to think in a truly post-network sense: beyond the relationships that have defined broadcast television for the last sixty years."

This morphostatic condition, the opposite of morphogenesis, reflects deviation amplifying feedback processes that produced transactional stasis in the assumption of market risk. These feedback processes were triggered by incipient events (indiscriminant securitization of debt; unvigilant lending; and precipitous regulation) for which insufficient mechanisms capable of disambiguating the safety of transactional counterparties existed over a sustained length of time. Thus, a systemic choice lemma was produced whereby inactivity, stasis, became more valuable than other market choices. Constituents of self-regulating systems (diversity, complexity, indeterminacy, openness, and nonlinear causality) are examined as attributes of a financial marketplace that interactively contributed to morphostasis and as to whether they modeled a fractal pattern of this event."

It has been used in studies exploring the relationship between the entire scale as well as its component subscales (awareness, internalization, and pressure) and variables related to body image. However, the 3-factor structure of the scale has never been confirmed via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), nor has the scale been evaluated with a racially diverse sample of children. This paper reports the results of CFAs establishing the multidimensionality of the scale and the unidimensionality of its subscales among a sample of 7-12-year-old girls and boys, primarily African American and Anglo American. The MMIS, due mostly to its pressure factor, also predicted the idealization of a thinner current (child) and future (adult) body both cross-sectionally and one year later, especially for girls and for Anglo American children."

Consistent with age identity theory, characters in older adults top 15 programs were older than characters in younger adults top 15 programs. Consistent with theories of emotional development, older adults (relative to younger adults) showed greater interest in news and less interest in situation comedies and violence. Character age provided partial mediation of age differences in news and sitcom viewing, but suppressed a negative relationship between viewer age and viewing of violence. Age differences in content preferences did not vary by time of measurement."
2009-1623,The Narrative Structure of Everyday Media Use,"Popular Media, Identity, and Everyday Life",,,,Paper,The Narrative Structure of Everyday Media Use,"Popular Media, Identity, and Everyday Life","Through narrative interviews, I have looked into the ideals and hopes for particular media activities and have found biographical narrative explanations for media consumption mixed with conventional ways of telling stories (Gergen 1997).
Through these explanations I have excavated how people have reasonable and accountable justifications (Scott&Lyman 1970) for particular media activities, thus in their explanations they reveal culturally specific recipes, myths and master narratives.
Through the difference emplotments (Ricouer 1992) being configured in narrative interviews, people are busy reflecting on their media use as past occurrences, as interpretable acts but also on media content and media technologies as props in on-going actions and anticipated future states (Schütz 1975)
This paper advocates that media consumption should not purely be seen as a decoding practice or an incorporation of media technologies into a particular context, but rather that media consumption is integrated in social action and everyday life projects of actors. As such media consumption should be seen as part of the creation and satisfying of ideas and motives in the mind of actors and therefore played out in everyday performances and presentations of everyday life (Goffman 1959).
Empirically this paper demonstrates how narrative interviews should be seen as one particular kind of personal presentation where people engage in a reflexive interpretation of experiences, however in telling and configuring these experiences through narrative interviews, people reveal the narrative structures of their everyday life experiences including how they tune in on specific media activities."

Bella Mody will investigate news coverage on line by comparing two more or less global websites BBC.Com and English.AlJazeera.net. On an index of comprehensive news coverage of the first 26 months of the crisis in Darfur Sudan (causes, remedies and the daily conduct), BBC.Com scored 50% and Al Jazeera scored 38%. Al Jazeera downplayed the crisis by featuring fewer articles on its website. It restricted stories to hard news and carried no opinion columns, presumably to accommodate the national sensitivities of Qatar and its royal owners interests. Reflecting the Middle East political position against Western intervention in their national affairs , more than half of Al Jazeeras articles addressed remedies initiated by the African Union and neighboring countries. Sources quoted were predominantly from Sudan and the African Union.
BBC.com presented news of the Darfur crisis before Al Jazeera did. It continued to do so with almost two and a half times as many articles as Al Jazeera carried. BBC.com articles went beyond hard news to include in-depth features and background articles. The BBC did not quote the UK as a source any more often than the UK was quoted by Al Jazeera. In point of actual fact, the BBC quoted Darfuris more often than Al Jazeera did, in spite of Al Jazeeras greater Arabic regional cultural and language affinity.
These findings will be the basis of discussion on whether and how news carried on global web sites reflects national interests differently from news carried by nationalisitic news paperss."

The lack of a broadly shared definition has several undesirable consequences, so this paper proposes a new definition grounded in the idea that interpersonal communication fundamentally involves the exchange of messages. The paper reviews and critiques some popular conceptualizations of interpersonal communication, develops the new definition, suggests that the new definition has the potential to provide an integrative framework for research on communication processes, structures, functions, and contexts, and concludes by considering some objections to the proposed definition."

Abstract
The role of emotion in communication processes has become a topic of increasing interest in recent years. In this presentation, I will (a) draw the distinction between emotions and moods, (b) overview both discrete and dimensional views of emotion, (c) note the primary areas of emotion and media research to date (e.g., fright reactions to media, fear appeals), (d) argue for the value of including consideration of emotion into any theory interested in predicting behavioral effects of the media, and (e) offer a few key examples of how emotion integrated into current theories (e.g., theory of reasoned action, social comparison theory, social cognitive theory) would help to boost their predictive power."

Recent Evidence from the Netherlands,Public Service Media: Protecting the Public Interest in the Digital Environment,,,,Paper,The Netherlands: Being Present Wherever the Public Is: Public Service Broadcasters Role on Digital Platforms. Recent Evidence from the Netherlands,Public Service Media: Protecting the Public Interest in the Digital Environment,"In the Netherlands, public broadcasting has taken the lead with its comprehensive digital strategy, containing an extensive Internet presence and a bouquet of seventeen thematic channels and thus leaving behind the main commercial competitors that are much more conservative in this respect. However, the success of the Internet also has a downside. In contrast with radio and television, higher reach via Internet signifies higher costs, hampering further development within the existing financial and legal frames. The question is how the public broadcaster can evolve from a transmission to a communication model, and whether these digital initiatives comply with the public value test and the market impact assessment the EU Commission plans to adopt in its efforts to make the public service broadcasting remit and funding both transparent and proportional to the services rendered."

Rational-choice theories suggest uncertainty will lead news organizations to monitor changes in their environment, such as new audience patterns and technological developments. Institutionalism suggests uncertainty will lead organizations to seek legitimacy by buffering themselves from changes, and by seeking to look like other organizations. Results of a content analysis and a national survey of U.S. newspaper editors show that in times of uncertainty, editors more often make business-like decisions in that they monitor audiences, and this is even more so for publicly owned, large newspapers. However, they tend to behave more like institutions and buffer themselves from change when making actual decisions about coverage and media forms. There was limited evidence of papers mimicking one another in times of uncertainty."

Key to uncovering opinionated news impact on public opinion is an understanding of how partisan audiences process opinionated news: Do the overt partisan cues in opinionated news stimulate biased processing, thereby enhancing attitude polarization among opposing partisans relative to non-opinionated news? Or, are opinionated news messages processed uniformly by partisans, contributing to direct persuasion? Or, according to a third possibility, does sensitivity to opinionated news non-objectivity prompt resistant processing  irrespective of ones prior predispositions? This paper addresses these questions by examining the effects of news opinionation  and its interaction with individual partisanship  on information processing and attitude change. Results from two experiments comparing audience responses to opinionated and non-opinionated news are presented. Both studies support a model of direct persuasion. Message processing and attitude change follow the direction of the news opinionation, without any variation by partisanship. Thus, there is no evidence that opinionated news intensifies attitude differences among opposing partisans, relative to non-opinionated news. Moreover, although perceptions of bias in opinionated news foster negative source processing, this source derogation only rarely interferes with the persuasive effects of opinionated news. Implications for theories of political information processing and for democratic politics are discussed."

The research focuses on the production moment from the circuit of culture model found in cultural studies. While the focus is on production, the study confirms the interconnectedness of those five circuit of culture moments of consumption, identity, representation, regulation, and production. The participants share the shows educational goals and messages, and they describe some of the decisions behind the creation of characters and specific programs. Several us/them dichotomies are also discussed."

Abstract
Research on the affective predictors, gratifications, and outcomes of consuming media entertainment has typically employed measures that are somewhat unidimensional. For example, affective measures are often based on valence (positive vs. negative) rather than on discrete emotions. Similarly, enjoyment as the primary and desired response has been assumed. Finally, the role of cognitive motivations and gratifications in the entertainment experience has been under researched. One implication of our conceptualizations is that we have puzzled over a host of seeming paradoxes involving viewers selecting and enjoying media entertainment in ways that seem counter to our theoretical assumptions. This presentation will highlight the utility of recent theorizing that is now beginning to recognize the utility of a broader conceptualization of the entertainment experiencenoting the importance of discrete emotions, recognizing the role of cognitive responses in the entertainment process, and exploring the importance of mixed affective reactions to media portrayals and characters."
2009-1632,Theoretical Implications for Change Management When Local Television News Becomes Personal and Portable,Mass Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,Theoretical Implications for Change Management When Local Television News Becomes Personal and Portable,Mass Communication Poster Session,"Prompted, in part, by the proliferation of Apple Computers digital media player, the iPod, media organizations are changing their product lines to include items that can be consumed away from the traditional media and the time-schedule on which such media have operated for decades. The conceptual frameworks used to study new technologies, new product development and change management are useful in contextualizing this change. Mintzberg & Westleys change management framework and Christensen et al.s disruptive innovations theory were most helpful in understanding television stations addition of podcasts to their product lines.
Eight of the 12 managers who participated in elite interviews did offer podcasts, but most were not actually producing NEW programming. The interview data illustrated the failure of what Mintzberg & Westley called the unfreezing process to take place in the process of organizational change."
2009-1633,Theories of Metaphor and Their Metaphors,Beyond Metaphors,,,,Paper,Theories of Metaphor and Their Metaphors,Beyond Metaphors,"Conceptions of metaphor vary widely from literary tropes to their embodiment in human perception and action. This paper will examine these, advance on those embodied in practices of living and suggest a new way to approach visual metaphors, which have heretofore been used without much depth. One of the findings is that metaphors, when taken as embodied, can hardly be theorized or explained without the use of metaphors, suggesting that the processes underlying the use of metaphors are far more basic to the use of language than credited in traditional theories of language, especially of representation. The paper will rely on metaphors emerging in the use of contemporary information technology."

In this paper, we explore potential sources of these perceptions in the socialization of young people into citizenship during their adolescent years. To explore these issues, we rely on data collected from a national cross-section of 12-17 years olds and their parents. Our analysis examines how demographic, ideological, conversational, and informational variables shape judgments of news credibility among American youth, our future voters. Our results demonstrate that factors such as political interest, opinion leadership and echo chamber variables play a significant role. Unlike adults partisanship or partisan strengths do not have significant influences in the media perceptions of adolescents."

This paper points to important theoretical thinkers and historical evidence that have arisen over the course of the last century in an attempt to illustrate how the educated classes have consistently been the most victimized segment of the U.S. citizenry, at least in terms of the consequences of a press that is too often docile to the whims of the most powerful sectors of politics and economics that it reports on in its news foreign affairs news content. This is the heart of the theoretical foundation of the media dependence model (MDM), a new model of news media analysis that I will introduce in this paper and for which I will provide theoretical and historical support. The MDM was largely inspired by the propaganda model (PM), penned by Herman and Chomsky. However, the PM only implicitly argues that treetops propaganda, which largely emanates from some of the most prestigious agenda-setting print sources in the U.S. news media, is one of the more significant factors in the process of ideological formation. The MDM attempts to further clarify, build upon and elucidate this important theoretical argument, which went largely unaddressed and was simply assumed in Herman and Chomskys work."

Colleges and universities around the country have tried to address this public health issue with standard alcohol prevention and intervention programs as well as social marketing measures such as the social norms campaign. Despite an increase in prevention efforts, little has changed in binge drinking prevalence at the individual college level. The purpose of this paper is to explain the relationships between environmental, developmental as well as psychological factors that help contribute to high-risk drinking behavior among college freshmen. In particular, this study, which tested both cognitive and behavioral theories, was a part of a larger evaluation project to provide health educators a baseline for formulating a more effective prevention strategy."
2009-1637,Theorizing Journalistic Role Conceptions,Role Remodel: New Directions for Journalistic Role Conception Research,,,,Paper,Theorizing Journalistic Role Conceptions,Role Remodel: New Directions for Journalistic Role Conception Research,"Journalistic role conceptions are much more frequently operationalized than theorized. That has been the case in part because of the seeming transparency of the concept. This presentation revisits how role conceptions have been theorized, offering a thorough concept explication, plumbing the functionalist assumptions that persist in contemporary studies, and exploring how different theoretical foundations point research in new directions. Current theorizing has been plagued by largely unaddressed agent-structure tensions. However, new theoretical approaches bring the problem into focus and offer compelling ways of moving forward. For example, while role conception is regularly studied at the individual level of analysis, Bourdieus field theory can lead to studying role conception at the routines, organizational, or system level. Giddens structuration theory can be used to explore the relationship between the individual journalists role conception and the organizational and cultural environment in which role conceptions are formulated and enacted."

The goal of this paper is to present segments from an unconventional relationship to examine friendship between men -- particularly a self-identified gay man and a self-identified straight man. In doing this, I theorize the complex relationship between straight and queer men and among queer men through personal narratives and autoethnographic writing. In addition, I also discuss potential influence of cultural differences in these relationships and how this plays into relational expectations, identity cues, and heteronormative assumptions and embodiment. Thus, I intend to theorize how the notion of straight troubles queer, while queer bodies deconstruct and reconstruct the notion of straight."

Extending both theory and methods employed in mate preference research, 184 young adults from the US, China, South Korea, Japan, and India, responded to a series of open-ended questions. Analytic induction procedures were used to create categories across six topics (good wife/bad wife, good husband/bad husband, good marriage/bad marriage. Some cultural concepts were identified in the reported gender and cultural differences: for US adults a wive should be loving and not untrustworthy, a husband should not be selfish, unfaithful or hurtful; a good marriage is characterized by giving and a bad marriage by untrustworthiness and poor communication. By contrast, in Asian cultures a good husband or wife provided for the family, a bad husband was irresponsible, and good marriages were marked by mutual respect. As hypothesized, relational communication characteristics were more important than attractiveness/ability characteristics acorss the five cultures. Sex differences were also detected, and knowledge of some dispreferred characteristics were valued more than preferred characteristics (like unfaithfulness). Most importantly, both propositions received support."

One of the more recent such programs is the development and subsequent testing of the theory of motivated information management (Afifi & Weiner, 2004). To date, the theory has been tested for its utility as a perspective from which to understand information-seeking decisions across several contexts. The authors have reflected on the incompleteness in the coverage of emotion in the framework and have argued that revisions to the theory need to extend its reach in that domain. This manuscript does so by incorporating an appraisal approach to the assessment of uncertainty discrepancy. The end product is a revision of the first two (of seven original) propositions in TMIMs structure and the addition of two new propositions."

Based on a content analysis of five years worth of newspaper stories that mentioned prominent non-profit organizations, the study found a significant, if episodic, agenda-setting impact on two newspapers by the outside interest groups. These groups are, to reformulate the familar phrase, sometimes stunningly successful in telling reporters what to report."

This innovation in preschool-age television viewing was first developed and researched in the United States, yet has failed to gain wider acceptance there. The acceptance and effectiveness of the parent bar was investigated in studies of various developmental phases. 88 children aged one to six years watched different variants of a programme, either at the kindergarten or at home. They were filmed during reception and later interviewed individually. In addition, 52 parents were surveyed using questionnaires. The findings indicated a significant increase in learning ability as well as a qualitative change of the reception situation and the parents empathy with the childrens perspective. On the basis of these results the parent bar was improved and this new version again was tested for acceptance and comprehensibility among 16 families. When it was first broadcast, the natural viewing situation was again monitored and accompanied by an online survey. Alongside the interesting results revealed in terms of substance and methodology, this is also an interesting example of practical cooperation between communication research and television production practice, with all its associated opportunities and risks."

Newspaper circulation, so the story goes, combined with geographically proximate centers of population and commerce to constitute the conditions necessary for inhabitants of the thirteen colonies to imagine themselves as part of a sovereign, limited political community whose members might never meet face to face. Without downplaying print capitalisms pivotal role in the formation of American national identity, this paper foregrounds the part played by bells, a medium whose contributions, to the formation of national identity and the shaping of the social world more generally, have been long overlooked by communication scholarship. At one time, bells composed the score and set the tempo for daily life in colonial America. They summoned listeners for civic and religious meetings, sounded the alarm when danger threatened, marked the hours, and regulated activity at the local level, but they also oriented listeners toward distant political and ecclesiastic communities. As tensions mounted between the British empire and its American colonies, bells played an important role in defining membership in communities, both face-to-face and imagined."

The undecided voters, who were identified initially by means of a structured questionnaire (2427 citizens), were subsequently interviewed in depth (136 among the undecided voters) and then re-contacted a few days before the election (99). By means of this on-going approach, it was therefore possible to follow the undecided left-wing voters (53) and their decisional processes up until the moment of the vote. The use of non-standard instruments also made it possible to examine the motivational aspects and the evaluations of the undecided voters. The final orientation seems to be the fruit of contingent humours, not of choices made thanks to the effects of the Campaign. The media are no longer able to mediate the relationship between ordinary citizens and the political system."

The present study especially considers the effects of social contextswhether the combinations of shirts and ties seem appropriate for a job interview and for a party. The behavioral data revealed that the reaction times were faster when the stimuli were judged as appropriate for the party condition. For the job interview condition, however, reaction times were faster with the inappropriate judgments. The electroencephalography analyses detected N270 component, known to be associated with cognitive conflicts. The results imply that electroencephalography analyses would be useful for examining perceived appropriateness (or conflicts) of combinations of a set of texts and texts (brand names slogans), texts and images (images of items and headlines in a visual ad), photos and captions, to name a few."

Using pretested messages, Study 1 formally tested the hypotheses. First, compared to the valence model, the functional model better accounted for the relationship between emotions and motivational systems. Second, as prescribed by the functional model, interactions of emotion and framing were found to significantly influence attitude. While gain frames produced more favorable attitudes for happy and angry participants, loss frames yielded more favorable attitudes among fearful individuals. Study 2 was also conducted to test a causal model for the emotion-by-framing interaction, and to identify the dominant motivational system under different emotion-by-framing match conditions. Structural equation modeling results revealed that emotion and framing had indirect effects on attitude and intention via message related cognition and fear. Additional model comparisons indicated that BAS guided the persuasion process when the approach emotions (anger and happiness) coupled with gain frames; BIS predicted the process when inhibition emotion (fear) fitted with loss frames.

Results indicated that for participants exposed to messages with exemplars, their perceived risk level of the bird flu was higher in the loss-framed condition than in the gain-framed condition. Also, for participants exposed to messages with exemplars, their attitudes toward the bird flu vaccine were more favorable in the loss-framed condition than in the gain-framed condition."
2009-1649,The Pitfalls and Promise of Neuroscientific Methods: The Case of the Elaboration Likelihood Model,terpersonal Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Pitfalls and Promise of Neuroscientific Methods: The Case of the Elaboration Likelihood Model,Interpersonal Communication Poster Session,"Communication as a field has always benefited from interdisciplinary influence, both theoretical and methodological, because communication as a phenomenon cuts across disciplines of human study. Recent technological innovations have made neuroscientific methodologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) widely accessible, such that neuroscientific inquiry is no longer limited to biomedical investigations. Though scholars in related fields such as social and cognitive psychology have begun to investigate questions of human social behavior (cf. Cacioppo and Berntson, 2004, 2005; Cacioppo et al. 2003, Easton & Emery, 2005), in the field of communication this opportunity remains unexplored with few exceptions (cf. Weber, Sherry, and Mathiak, 2009). This paper elucidates the theoretical benefits of incorporating neuroscientific methods into human communication study and presents the elaboration likelihood model as a ""test case"" for how examining current theory through the lens of neuroscience can clarify and improve the state of the discipline."
2009-1650,The Political Power of Personal Media in Wartime,The Emerging Futures of War Reporting,,,,Paper,The Political Power of Personal Media in Wartime,The Emerging Futures of War Reporting,"This paper reflects upon the political power of personal media such as the weblog, email and content-sharing websites during wartime. By drawing together a number of examples from conflicts in Iraq, South Ossetia/Georgia and Zimbabwe, it explores some of the ways such media attain the status of being outside or even disruptive of official representations of war. In particular, it emphasises the extent to which they can act to disrupt what Raymond Williams (1982) termed the culture of distance by which distant publics are left insulated from the suffering and violence of war. The paper suggests that less critical attention be focused on certain individuals independence from power or from large news organisations and more on the forms of the discourse they produce. That is, prominent cases from recent conflicts suggest that the political power of personal media lies partly in the way their highly subjective and intersubjective modes of producing knowledge of war and their appeal to universal human values can, at times, evade the easy certainties of us and them dichotomies.

2009-1651,The Politics of Framing in Science Journalism,Framing as a Key Word in the Reporting of Critical Social Issues,,,,Paper,The Politics of Framing in Science Journalism,Framing as a Key Word in the Reporting of Critical Social Issues,"The keyword framing is being increasingly recognized as a practicable way to characterize the social relations of representation shaping the news reporting of science and risk. It is often described as a discursive strategy utilized by journalists to define the nature of a particular event, a process with implications for how certain occurrences are selected as newsworthy, the narrative conventions guiding the ways in which they are reported, and the possible consequences for influencing public perceptions. This paper examines Nisbet and Mooneys (2007) call for scientists to proactively frame their findings, and the controversy it generated amongst science bloggers. In the course of analyzing the debate across the blogosphere, it explores issues regarding the relative advantages and limitations of framing, especially where the news reporting of scientific uncertainty is concerned. In offering an evaluative assessment, the paper discerns a basis for the further elaboration of framing as a keyword."
2009-1652,The Polytechnic Agenda: An Opportunity Lost?,Forging a Coherent Disciplinary Identity: Readings in the History of British Communication Studies,,,,Paper,The Polytechnic Agenda: An Opportunity Lost?,Forging a Coherent Disciplinary Identity: Readings in the History of British Communication Studies,"The new polytechnic institutions on the late 1960s were driven by a pragmatic agenda. Although some of the polytechnics had a significant history which was associated with their constituent institutions, notably the London polytechnics, their new mission was to democratise higher education by engaging overtly with the idea of vocationalism. This idea was not associated with the older established universities who, arguably, divorced it from their research-driven educational agenda on the relatively undebated assumption that their educational values were implicitly vocational. The polytechnics made this explicit: courses were to be developed which would be attractive to students and would give them a clear advantage in the job market. As such, polytechnic provision commodotised education as polytechnics invested themselves in the modern disciplines, particularly communication and media studies, because students could be readily recruited, courses and staff developed, and because significantly the older universities did not offer them. The consequences of this realignment have shaped the development of communication study in the UK: each polytechnic designed its own communication course in line not with disciplinary priorities but with staffing and recruitment imperatives. The validating body, the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) tried to identify a disciplinary perspective but was generally agreed not to have done so. This paper explores theses issues in the establishing of communication studies in the polytechnic sector in the UK and maps their influence onto the present disciplinary landscape."

It was determined that 275 programs in this 168 hours sample across ten networks featured at least one character with a mental illness. In this second phase 452 individual characters were analyzed to determine how these characters were portrayed to the audience. Scales were developed based upon how dangerous and how vulnerable these characters appeared, as well as what characteristics of mental illness these characters put forth and what their socio-economic status was. Differences on these scales by sex, race, marital status, and type of character are examined."

The sample consisted of 178 characters, representing 25 shows with a scripted plot and recurring characters which air on the five broadcast networks: ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX and the CW. The primary goal of the pilot study was to compare how gender, race, and occupation are portrayed on primetime television. In comparison to men and other racial minority groups, it was found that of the 13 African American women coded in the entire sample, a little more than half were employed. Most held jobs as professionals and members of law enforcement. Second, the relationship between race and gender, and work status, as well as between race and gender and job authority was explored. Though significant results were not found, this could be explained by the existence of more racially-diverse and gender-balanced casts. However, Asians, Native Americans, and blue collar workers were notably absent, while most characters worked in law enforcement. Implications for future content analyses are discussed."
2009-1655,The Possibility of Establishing Universal Mobile Phone Service Policy: The Case of South Korea,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,,,,Paper,The Possibility of Establishing Universal Mobile Phone Service Policy: The Case of South Korea,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,"This study explores the possibility of applying universal service policy ideal on mobile phone service which alters plain old telephone service(POTS). Major findings of this study are as follows. First, in the case of South Korea, the penetration rate of mobile phone has reached 83% nationally, and 70% of whole people's communication demand based on mobile phone service. This findings indicate that mobile phone became an essential social communication medium. Nonetheless, more than 10% out of total population still remains unaccessable to mobile phone service because of their geographic, financial, and physical difficulties. Second, the oligopolistic market structure has been impeding workable competition, and this fact suggests that diffusion of mobile phone service to the least-advantaged people through market competition seems not be possible. Third, universal service policy imperatives of South Korea, United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia have institutional flexibility regarding expanding the scope of universal service. After these examinations, this paper argues that mobile phones became one of 'bare essentials' what should constitute a universal service package. Whilst it is important to consider issues of economic efficiency in the communications sector, this should neither obscure nor compromise the need to create progressive, socially responsible, universal service reflective of the requirements of 21st century users."

This theory paper presents an overview of the some of the varying definitions and approaches to the study of digital literacy being applied in some highly-cited research into this concept in various fields. It then offers a greater explication of the concept, supported by some critical scholarly perspectives. Finally, the paper presents design-based research (and the Constructionist framework for action) as alternative approaches that may be useful for exploring digital literacy development. Ultimately, I argue that the design-based research paradigm provides one important perspective on how the study of the phenomenon  digital literacy development -- might be conducted and framed, and sheds light on the field and landscape of the many variables and theories inherent to this phenomenon that are yet to be discovered. The many assumptions inherent to the term digital literacy may make it too inexplicit to serve as a useful singular research concept and variable."
2009-1657,The Posteffects Era?,Keywords in Communication: Effects (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,The Posteffects Era?,Keywords in Communication: Effects (Cross Unit),"Everyone knows that media content is bad for you. Violence, sex, advertising, thin images; all are clearly destroying the fabric of civilization. The only problem is that effects researchers have had difficulty showing anything more than trivial effects (< 3% variance explained) with highly sensitive proxy outcome measures of these ill effects (e.g., adjective check-offs, noise blasts). Theory is rarely tested, but instead shown. IRBs wont even let us conduct experiments with outcome measures of what we are concerned about (e.g., real violence, actual sexual behavior, etc.). Many of the theories used and taught by effects researchers are remnants of another time in media history, where the number of channels was much fewer and the choices more limited. Has it come time to finally pack up the tent on the effects paradigm? If not, when? What should we be teaching? And where do all the out-of-work effects researchers go? How do we make a case for tenure lines and research funding, if not for social problem research? My paper will address these issues, beginning with a overview of the problems in the literature and ending with suggestions for new ways to conceptualize effects research."

With a well-established cultural and intellectual critique as a backdrop, the mid 1940s saw the beginnings of a popular revolt against broadcast media. Widespread condemnation of excessive commercialism in American broadcasting was evidenced by a broad canvas of press coverage and large numbers of Americans writing letters to the FCC. The following analysis catalogs the various groups, campaigns, and strategies that constituted the beginnings of a full-fledged media reform movement in the postwar 1940s. Though disparate, these groups media reform efforts demonstrate that such unrest can not be characterized as merely the grumblings of a few malcontents composed of the usual suspects. Rather, these groups varied in demographics and ideology, yet were remarkably similar in many of their core critiques, and often coalesced around common goals."

Using a content analysis, this study investigates how Korean newspapers have defined the Noblesse (noble people) and their obliges (obligations). The results indicate that 1) the political elite group has lost their authority due to their misconduct, 2) the economic elite group has emerged as a new ruling group, and 3) the positive description of an upper class has increased. This study concludes that noblesse oblige which was originally adopted as the rhetoric to criticize elites has been transformed into the rhetoric to justify the authority of the economic elite group."

The latter focused predominantly on the issues of social support, trust, and credibility and did not look specifically at the pragmatics of advice.
This study employs a pragmatic perspective to investigate patterns and structures of peer advice interactions among members of an online community. The findings suggest that advice exchange is a common type of social interaction in online communities of peers. Moreover, messages that solicit and provide advice have their own distinctive structural and pragmatic features."

Palin entered the field as a relative unknown, yet following two disastrous and embarrassing interviews, hid from the national media by refusing to hold a press conference or talk to non-partisan members of the press corps. Filling this absence as a powerful, framing paratext, Feys impression held particular power to author the candidate. Feys star image as an intelligent and capable woman also gestured to absences in Palins character and resume. Thus, as the presence to Palins absence, Feys impression rose to a plateau rarely achieved by SNL: genuine political satire and critique. Here, I will discuss this impression and its role as framing device in subsequent journalistic discussion of the candidate.

A representative survey of U.S. adults replicates the oft-cited average of one to two lies per day but finds that the distribution is highly skewed. On an average day, 60% of respondents claim to tell no lies and the majority of lies are told by a small subset of prolific liars. These results indicate that the prevalence of lying varies widely across the population. Consequently, explanations concerning the nature of lying and methods by which lies are detected need to account for this variation."
2009-1663,The Problematic Privatization of Programs for the Public Good,Theory and Policy in Communication for Social Change,,,,Paper,The Problematic Privatization of Programs for the Public Good,Theory and Policy in Communication for Social Change,"Through this work, I address the consequences of privatizing development programs, which are ostensibly designed to promote the public good. Since the 1980s, the US and other development institutions have been partnering increasingly with private corporations more vested in profit than humanitarian ventures. While the trend is clear, the consequences are not. This sample of 40 recent projects (implemented since 2001) is explored in terms of the structural conditions of production, including attention to the sources of funding and political agendas of donor and implementing agencies, as well as the media texts themselves. Themes raised in the projects are compared across projects that include and avoid private corporate partnership. The analyses presented here represent exploratory stages in an extended research trajectory on the subject."

Its obvious role in politics, civil society, the family, and identity makes it and obvious object of research in media and mass communications research. Yet, serious work on the question of religion per se, or on the role of religion in relation to other issues, lags behind. This paper considers that part of the reason for this lacuna lies in the conceptual and methodological problems raised by the religion variable. It will look at the ways that religion defies and stands outside of many of the categories of analysis in media research, at the same time that it poses some important technical problems in measurement and analysis. It will also explore some of the key questions and issues that media scholars should be addressing in relation to it."

In this brief talk, I wish to look at particular identities that appear as secondary discourse in Japanese TV advertising. Employing examples culled from the past decade, I will highlight identifications that are regularly encoded into Japanese TV ads and consumed by viewers. These include: gender, nation, affectivity, and us-ness. My remarks aim at: (1) exposing the mechanisms by which identification is re/produced; (2) providing specific manifestations, and (3) identifying outcomes. Where appropriate, I will compare the presence of and approaches to adentity appeals in other countries, to help bring these findings into greater relief."
2009-1666,The Production of Spectacle / The Spectacle of Production: An Ethnographic Study of Film/TV Media Production,pectacle/ Narrative/ Truth,,,,Paper,The Production of Spectacle / The Spectacle of Production: An Ethnographic Study of Film/TV Media Production,Spectacle/ Narrative/ Truth,"As Walter Benjamin noted, the production of commercial film and television constitutes a spectacle. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Hollywood and Hong Kong, I examine several visual images that are created and on- and off-screen forms of spectacle. I focus on the audience of media workers who mediate in the immediate site of production: film and television sets. Media workers form a preliminary audience that requires further study. Many media workers are not concerned with educating or enlightening audiences about how to be citizens or consumers; in fact, many of these media workers during filming consider audiences as secondary to themselves as spectators. To provide a historical anchor for my claim, I invoke Tom Gunnings theorization of cinema of attractions. The inspiration for this early period of filmmaking  magic shows, vaudeville, and circuses - continues to permeate the character of film/TV production in Hollywood and Hong Kong. Early films key feature of provoking stimulus illustrates my point that forms of interactivity are happening long before paying audiences view the finished product. The immediate audience of media workers is a participatory one that talks back to the images on the factory floor of production in ways that show that reception is simultaneously occurring amid production. This immediate audiences capacity to mediate should not be underestimated in the study of how and why media plays a powerful role since decisions about how imagery and performance are created are determined not only by studio executives and corporations but also by individuals below-the-line ."

The authoritarian regimes allow the press to act occasionally with a certain degree of freedom, critical newspapers may use different tactics to survive and, at the same time, pursue democracy. Within the watchdog journalism practice of China, the ideological domination and democratic nature of the media includes the characteristics of party character and publicness. This study applies critical discourse analysis as a specific methodology, by which it analyzes the transformations of public opinion supervision discourse during the past 30 years in China. By analyzing the news reports that won the first-class prize in the Chinese Journalism Prize from 1979 to 2006, this study also explores the impacts of the concrete articulations of state-media power relations. This empirical study focuses on the role of Chinese news media in the transition from an authoritarian regime, tracing the exploration on the publicness of the media within the orbit of the party state, and describes the experiences and models of media exploration on the publicness of social practice in this transformation. In so doing, this paper contributes to enriching our understanding of how the main tactics of the Chinese media are applied in regard to the democratically discursive and social practice."
2009-1668,The Public Sphere and Media in Slovakia,Twenty Years of Free Media and the Public Sphere in Central Europe,,,,Paper,The Public Sphere and Media in Slovakia,Twenty Years of Free Media and the Public Sphere in Central Europe,"This paper will analyse the role of public sphere and various functions of the media and other actors in its initiation (agenda-setting), modifying (framing) and keeping alive (or moving away from the centre of political and social life) in Slovakia in the years 1989-2008.
The process of social, political and economy transition from communist rule in the former communist bloc involved not only the transformation of the economy from a centrally planned to a free market and the creation of democratic political institutions but also the establishment of mass media appropriate to the circumstances of that transition. The case of Slovakia illustrates the importance in that process of free and independent public sphere, and especially of the NGOs. The constantly changing political circumstances in which the media operated affected their role in the country´s attempt to create public sphere, both within the framework of Czechoslovakia and especially during the first years of Slovakia´s independence.
Thus, while it was judiciary that played a key role in Italy in the 1990s in transforming politics and society and thus public sphere, and there were the local radio stations that transformed politics and society in Greece and thus Greek public sphere in the 1980s, this paper argues that it was impact of both free and independent media and NGOs that transformed politics and society and thus public sphere in Slovakia in the 1990s and later.
Yeti t seems that both the role of the media and NGOs in this process was somehow mystified. This paper will explore this assertion."

Despite outsider status within the GOP establishment and limited exposure in the mainstream media, his online network of supporters remained fervent, generous and participatory. This ethnographic essay charts how and why the movement took hold. Through observation, interviews and textual analysis, I document the political beliefs and user-generated content of activist supporters. I argue that Ron Paul followers experience a profound disaffection from the mainstream media and the dichotomous paradigm of American political parties and suggest that this may hint a latent identity crisis for the 21st century Republican Party. More broadly, I contend that Pauls campaign signals a new horizon for increasingly participatory political audiences in the emergent era of Web 2.0."

Using flooding as a case study, we examined the interplay of ecological worldviews and news framed either as emphasizing harmony with nature or as mastery over nature, on individuals preference for flood protection policy. A total of 255 undergraduate students participated in a 2 (ecological worldviews: balance-with-nature vs. human-domination-over-nature) x 2 (media frames: harmony frame vs. mastery frame) between-subjects experiment. The findings indicated that both the balance-with-nature worldview and the human-domination-over-nature worldview had significant impacts on preference for flood protection policy. Furthermore, the harmony frame amplified the effect of the balance-with-nature worldview in supporting a natural approach to flood protection. In contrast, the mastery frame amplified the effect of the human-domination-over-nature worldview on the preference for a structural approach to flood protection. Implications are discussed."

This study explores the effects of changes in electoral systems on political marketing, and, more particularly, the impact of the shift from the parliamentary electoral system which has been in operation in Israel since 1948, to the presidentary (combined of elements from the parliamentary system, and the presidential system) on the two largest Israeli parties' marketing strategies. Two hundred seven (207) out of 670 political broadcasts of Likud and the Labor parties were examined for five out of the six electoral campaigns that took place since 1988: The 1988 and 1992 campaigns, before the switch to the presidentary system, the 1996 and 1999 campaigns after the establishment of the combined system and the 2003 campaign, after Israel changed back to the parliamentary electoral system.
The findings supported the study's main arguments regarding the extent and direction of the impact of the change in the electoral system on the developments in the political marketing. Beginning in 1996, there was a decrease in broadcasts presenting political issues and a sharp increase in broadcasts that focus on personality alone. Equivalently, the percentage of broadcasts addressing the center of the political map, rather than distinct publics, grew significantly. In 2003, with the return to the parliamentary system, the marketing strategy of the two parties, and more particularly of the Labor Party, changed back to the pre-1992 pattern: a large percentage of the broadcasts focused on issues and not on the candidates' personalities, and addressed distinct target audiences rather than the center."

Data from 48 teachers who taught All Stars up to three consecutive years and their respective seventh grade students (n=2,240) indicate that having an authoritative communication style is related to lower quality relationships between teachers, their students, and a curriculum, while having an expressive communicator style improves the same relationships. These findings raise important implications for teacher training and implementation of school-based substance use prevention programs."

The collection of personal information online boosts customized services for consumers, but at the same time it increases concerns about privacy infringement. Using a content analysis of the most visited Web sites in Korea and the United States, this study compares the depth and breadth of information requested by Web proprietors and examines the relationship between the information requests and privacy policies of Web sites. Korea-based Web sites have stronger privacy policies, but they request much more detailed and varying information from consumers than do US-based Web sites. The findings also indicate that US Web sites that present stronger privacy policies request more information from consumers."

This study explores whether the Family Communication Patterns (FCP) would associate with effective drug-prevention practices, including communication warmth, parental monitoring and parent-child communication about drug use. A survey of 289 emerging adults found that socio-orientation positively associated with parental monitoring and concept-orientation positively related to communication warmth and parent-child communication about drugs. Also, the effects of the FCP on emerging adults drug use behavior are mediated through communication warmth and parental monitoring. Implications for family intervention programs and the importance of parent-child communication environment are discussed."

My objective is to draw attention to how media discourse conceptualises the feminine as subject and object of texts, seeking recourse in stereotypes to counter other stereotypes which do not fit in with the liberal ideals of citizenship both papers allegedly profess. I will address the way in which both papers represent issues linked to the public and private spheres, so as to explore the extent to which public space is masculinised and private space is feminised. In effect, both Público and Diário de Notíciass editorial statues contemplate the rejection of interference in citizens private sphere. The general public interest is not regarded as overlapping with private matters, as if citizens public personae constitute manifestations of ideal standards suitable to particular situations  namely that of newspaper reading  which do not come under the aegis of the private sphere. The framing of issues pertinent to feminism within a news agenda-setting context that draws attention to topical issues, usually ostracised from newspapers, will also be examined. In this manner, I hope to establish a link between academic feminist discourse and the journalistic representation of women in the Portuguese mainstream press, inquiring into the degree to which media texts have been influenced by either liberal or radical feminisms."
2009-1677,The Revolution of Speaking and Listening: Communication and Community Building in the Zapatista Commune,Keywords in Communication: Community,,,,Paper,The Revolution of Speaking and Listening: Communication and Community Building in the Zapatista Commune,Keywords in Communication: Community,"This paper explores the communicational basis of the Zapatista revolution in speaking and listening (Lorenzano, 1998). Drawing on Jesus Martin Barberos (1993; 2004) insistence that communication studies overcome the influential media-centrism that reduces thinking about communication to technological considerations and the mechanics of information circulation, I argue that the centrality of communication in the Zapatista political commune poses a vital challenge to the instrumental conception of both politics and communication that has informed many prominent analyses of the both Zapatismo and the Information Society. The paper focuses on two key Zapatista communicational practices: the construction and circulation of the communiqués and the making of a community-based justice system, giving specific attention to the development of the Revolutionary Womens Law. Throughout, I suggest that the Zapatistas radical democratic communication practices created a spatial and ideological aperture for a far-reaching reconceptualization of community and communication in the post-cold war period."
2009-1678,The Rhetorical Construction of the Aged Identity: Ethos and Redefinition as Counterrhetoric,tergroup Communication in Organizations and Institutions (Age and Aging),,,,Paper,The Rhetorical Construction of the Aged Identity: Ethos and Redefinition as Counterrhetoric,Intergroup Communication in Organizations and Institutions (Age and Aging),"Aging in the Western world is accompanied by processes of marginalization. The majority of seniors become more and more invisible as they age, associated with deterioration and insignificance. In this analysis I argue that elderly people are the owners and articulators of their self-identity as old. By examining a relevant site for the saliency of agea senior advisory boardI examine how the rhetorical work of the aged identity gets done in ordinary and generic conversations. Using a symbolic interactionist and rhetorical critical perspective, I contend that an everyday rhetoric provides the means for an audience to talk back to dominant rhetorics. In discussions that index personal and civic identity, seniors resist and re-appropriate ageist rhetorics with a counter-rhetoric that claims an authentic ethos and a redefinition of old age as strength."
2009-1679,"The Rise of the Anglophone in an Increasingly Multilayered, Transnational Danish Television System and Audience?",Local-Global Tensions in News and Entertainment,,,,Paper,"The Rise of the Anglophone in an Increasingly Multilayered, Transnational Danish Television System and Audience?",Local-Global Tensions in News and Entertainment,"This paper sees globalization as the emergence of multiple logics of production, flow and audience reception, based on identity. They are very unequal or asymmetric in their reach and power, but they are also dynamic, changing along with both structural and cultural forces, as an examination of the viewing and broadcast time for television from various countries in Denmark, 1993-2007, shows. As channels have multiplied over time, the proportion of Danish content has gone down, but viewing of Danish content remains high. U.S. content has increased but viewing of it has not. Both screening and viewing of other Anglophone content has gone up considerably, while screening and viewing of Nordic and European content remains low. So while Danish viewers focus in viewing (and arguably in identity) is still on Danish culture, their secondary interest (and identity?) has become more Anglophone, not Nordic or European, from 1993-2007. This study reviews language impact studies and other cultural theories to consider reasons for that."
2009-1680,The Role of Anger and Information in Deliberation (Top Student Paper),Emotion in Political Communication,,,,Paper,The Role of Anger and Information in Deliberation (Top Student Paper),Emotion in Political Communication,"Normative theories of deliberative democracy have revolved around the concept of the rational citizen. Ideally, fully informed and motivated citizens would gather together to engage in careful weighing of ideas and arrive at the best solution. The purpose of this study is to question such assumptions of the ideal citizen by examining the effects of one particular emotion, i.e., anger, and information on the deliberation process and post-deliberative outcomes. I hypothesized that a) anger will have a main effect on the deliberation process and the post-deliberation outcomes; b) amount of information will have a main effect on the deliberation process and post deliberation outcomes; and c) the effect of anger on deliberation will differ by the amount of information given (interaction effect). Participants were assigned to one of the four conditions (2(anger)x2(information)) to read articles about a controversial issue on environmental conservation. They then engaged in a 3 - 4 person group discussion about the issue described in the articles. Video recordings of the discussions were content analyzed for assessing the deliberation process. Post-deliberation outcomes were assessed through self-reported measures after the discussion sessions. Results indicate a clear pattern of anger significantly influencing the post-deliberation outcomes but not necessarily individual performance during the deliberation process. Level of information, on the other hand, affected the deliberation process, while only having an indirect effect on the post-deliberation outcomes. Anger and informations distinctive routes of effects open up new interpretations on the functioning of the two in deliberation processes."
2009-1681,The Role of Conflict Resolution Styles in Mediating the Relationship Between Enduring Vulnerabilities and Marital Quality,"Conflict, Aggression, and Abuse in Relational Contexts",,,,Paper,The Role of Conflict Resolution Styles in Mediating the Relationship Between Enduring Vulnerabilities and Marital Quality,"Conflict, Aggression, and Abuse in Relational Contexts","This investigation examines some of the potential underlying processes and factors associated with marital stability. The vulnerability-stress-adaptation (VSA) model of marital development was used to explain the relationships between enduring vulnerabilities, conflict resolution styles and marital quality. This study used an existing data set consisting of 194 married couples and was examined using dyadic analyses and tests of mediation. Results indicate that wives negative affectivity is significantly associated with their own marital quality and that of their husbands. However, husbands negative affectivity is only associated with their own marital quality. Actor and partner tests of mediation indicate that positive problem solving, conflict engagement, and withdrawal were able to explain the relationship between negative affectivity and marital quality for husbands and wives. This study highlights the impact communication processes have on a dyadic level in marital relationships. These findings will allow scholars, clinicians, and married individuals to further understand some of the factors and processes that contribute to dyadic adjustment and stable marriages."

2009-1683,The Role of Key Words in Terrorism Coverage: Framing Analysis From the Dramatism Perspective,"The Media, Terrorists, and Other Bad Guys",,,,Paper,The Role of Key Words in Terrorism Coverage: Framing Analysis From the Dramatism Perspective,"The Media, Terrorists, and Other Bad Guys","Media and terrorism has been an area of research which has attracted researchers interests in looking at the strategic dimensions of framing. Researchers look at how different communities, in conflict situations such as terrorist attacks, dispute meaning and interpretation of similar events. Entmans (2003 and 2004) cascading activation model is an interesting tool to look at results of this sort of framing contests. However, the variable cultural resonance suggested by this model is only able to explain after the whole process of communication. This paper combines both Entmans model with dramatism theory. The principle of drama by which a scenario has to be consistently built provides tools to assess the inner capacity of a frame to cascade through.
This paper analyzes four speeches and their press coverage in conflict situations: reaction from the Government and the opposition to ETA terrorist band in Spain. For the analysis of the speeches Burkean concepts of the Pentad and ritual of purification (as well as their corresponding evaluative concepts) are applied to assess the quality of motivations of both communicators. For the press coverage, Entmans cascading activation model is applied.
Empirical analysis shows a two sided context with two very different interpretations of the situation associate to a highly fragmented capacity for cultural resonance: assessments of the communicator motivations are made differently by two communities (parties and newspapers) who are strongly disputing meaning. Combination of framing theory and dramatism theory enriches the strategic dimension of framing analysis."
2009-1684,The Role of Media Literacy in Adolescents Responses to and Interpretations of Mediated Sexual Messages,Adolescents and Sexual Media Content,,,,Paper,The Role of Media Literacy in Adolescents Responses to and Interpretations of Mediated Sexual Messages,Adolescents and Sexual Media Content,"Sexually transmitted diseases and teen pregnancy rates are remarkably high in the United States when compared to similar rates in other developed countries, and research indicates that television and other media serve as important sources of sexual information for young people. Increasingly, health educators are recognizing media literacy as a tool that educators can use to strengthen adolescents critical thinking skills and resistance to mediated sexual messages. In this study, a pretest-posttest quasi-experiment conducted in the field, researchers examined a theory-based media literacy curriculum to determine its influence on adolescents attitudes and decision making concerning sex and understanding of sexual portrayals in the media. Study results indicated that participants who received the media literacy training better understood that media influence teens sex-related decision making and were more likely to report that sexual depictions in the media misrepresented actual sexual behaviors. Participants who received the media literacy training also were more likely to believe that teens practice sexual abstinence and expressed greater efficacy in resisting peer pressure than control group participants. In addition, study results indicated that media literacy affected participants differently based on their gender in terms of their perceived desirability of sexual media messages, their expectancies for engaging in sexual behavior and their ability to resist peer pressure. Together, these findings indicate that health educators should consider using media literacy lessons in an effort to improve adolescents decision making regarding sex and perhaps in other health communication contexts."
2009-1685,The Role of Media Literacy in Changing Adolescents Responses to Alcohol Advertising,"Children, Adolescents, and the Media Top Papers",,,,Paper,The Role of Media Literacy in Changing Adolescents Responses to Alcohol Advertising,"Children, Adolescents, and the Media Top Papers","Fearing the negative impact alcohol advertising might have on adolescents receptiveness to alcohol, the current study applied the Message Interpretation Process Model and parental mediation to the design and evaluations of a media literacy curriculum focusing on alcohol use prevention. A pretest-posttest quasi-experiment of 171 adolescents was conducted to examine the impact of a negative and a balanced (a combination of negative and positive evaluative approaches) approach to media literacy on modifying adolescents responses to alcohol messages. Results showed that different media literacy approaches had varying degree of effectiveness on adolescent boys and girls. After receiving a negative media literacy lesson, adolescent boys regarded television characters as less realistic and believed that drinking alcohol had negative consequences. Adolescent girls benefited from a balanced evaluative approach as their media skepticism attitude was enhanced. Results suggest that health educators should employ media literacy to enhance adolescents critical thinking skills and to improve their decision making regarding alcohol."
2009-1686,The Role of Mixed Affect in the Experience of Meaningful Entertainment,"Mood, Emotion and Enjoyment of the Media",,,,Paper,The Role of Mixed Affect in the Experience of Meaningful Entertainment,"Mood, Emotion and Enjoyment of the Media","Recent research has suggested that in addition to consuming media entertainment for purposes of pleasure (hedonistic motivations), individuals may also consume entertainment for purposes of greater insight, contemplation, and experiences of meaningfulness (eudaimonic motivations). This paper presents two studies designed to explore the relationship between eudaimonic entertainment consumption and meaningful affective reactions (e.g., feelings of sympathy, warmth, introspection, and poignancy). Study 1 revealed that more enduring trait-like eudaimonic motivations were associated with preferences for entertainment that elicits meaningful affect, with meaningful affect, in turn, associated with mixed affective responses (the simultaneous experience of positive and negative feelings). Likewise, Study 2 revealed that mixed affect was predictive of meaningful affective states, with meaningful affect, in turn, associated with greater eudaimonic state-like preferences. These results are interpreted as suggesting that prior research that has concluded that sad individuals appear to enjoy sad entertainment"" may be better interpreted as illustrating that the experience of meaningful affective states heightens preferences for entertainment that grapples with questions of human poignancies and life meanings."
2009-1687,The Role of Parental Modeling and Family Communication Patterns in Developing Communication Competence in Homeschooled Children,Family Communication Processes: At the Intersection of Family and Community,,,,Paper,The Role of Parental Modeling and Family Communication Patterns in Developing Communication Competence in Homeschooled Children,Family Communication Processes: At the Intersection of Family and Community,"The purpose of this study was to examine family factors (i.e., parental modeling of communication competence and family communication patterns) that are associated with the development of communicative competence in homeschooled students. Participants included 101 parent-child dyads from homeschooling families. Results of a hierarchical regression indicated that parent communication competence and family conversation orientation were significantly associated with child competence. Additionally, parent competence significantly interacted with conversation orientation in predicting child competence. Family conformity orientation was not significantly related to child communication competence. These findings suggest that family communicative context plays an important role in the socialization of homeschooled students."
2009-1688,The Role of Reasonable Hostility in Public Deliberation,The Practice of Deliberation,,,,Paper,The Role of Reasonable Hostility in Public Deliberation,The Practice of Deliberation,"Drawing examples from a 35-month case study of the discourse of school board meetings in one Western US district, this paper reflects on the productive and problematic practices of public deliberation. In particular I advance two arguments: First, I suggest why the frequently-invoked norm of conduct, that is, calling for ""respectful,"" ""polite"" or civil"" exchanges, is problematic. Pointing out flaws in another's position and his or her reasons
for holding that view, I show, is regularly be seen as disrespectful by targets of criticism. Some kinds of hostility are reasonable. Second, I argue that an adequate conception of public deliberation needs to adopt a larger frame that does not limit deliberation to an argumentative assessment of one person's expression. Instead, we should conceptualize deliberation as a process that connects people's comments in meetings to letters and
editorials in local newspapers and then back to meeting discussion."
2009-1689,The Role of the Internet for Civil Action: The Case of Candlelight Rallies Against U.S. Beef Imports in South Korea,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,,,,Paper,The Role of the Internet for Civil Action: The Case of Candlelight Rallies Against U.S. Beef Imports in South Korea,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,"Since the Internet rapidly expanded during the 1990s, it has been integrated into the daily life of general public. Although a digital divide may still exist in most societies, the Internet has become one of the common media systems like the traditional mass media. However, the Internet is not just like those traditional media. As a gigantic marketplace of ideas, it powerfully functions as an interpersonal communication tool. The impact of the Internet on civil action is one of the popular interests among scholars. Yet, assessing political use of the Internet is not easy, because collective civil action cases seldom occur. This study examines a case of the Candlelight Rally against U.S. beef imports in South Korea, the largest anti-government protest of the Korean citizens who objected the governments agreement to relax restrictions on beef imports from the U.S. Using the concept of communication connectedness as the theoretical framework, this study examines if individuals connectedness to the Internet had an impact on their participation in the Candlelight Rallies. Data for the study comes from 275 college students in Seoul, Korea. Results show that the Internet played a critical role on mobilizing collective action during the Candle Rallies. Furthermore, data showed that the more an individual paid attention to the online discussion web-site, the more likely he/she was to take actions both online and offline."

The research is part of a larger project that analyzes, in depth, the process of networked news production in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Over the course of this larger project I undertook a 60-month process of iterative fieldwork, both on-and offline, with the most intense period of observation occurring between May and August 2008. I also conducted more than 60 semi-structured interviews with journalists, editors, activists, bloggers, and media executives to gain insight into news forms of journalistic work. Over the two week period around which this paper revolves, I watched how a simple story about the arrest and detention of four Philadelphia homeowners moved from activist websites, to the alternative press, to the inner pages of the Philadelphia Daily News, the citys daily tabloid newspaper, to major national blogs. My methods during this time period can be placed into three general categoriesprimitive network analysis (i.e., using the online search engine Technorati and newspapers own web statistics to document how stories about the arrests linked to other stories); second, qualitative content analysis of the ways these different stories were framed; and finally, observation of the meetings and decision-making processes of journalists and bloggers themselves, often in real time."
2009-1691,The Roles of Positive Affect and Risk Perception in Risky Driving,Keywords in Information Systems: Emotion (High Density),,,,Paper,The Roles of Positive Affect and Risk Perception in Risky Driving,Keywords in Information Systems: Emotion (High Density),"Objective: To determine the extent to which risky driving behaviors are associated with perceptions of risk and positive affect in teenaged and adult drivers. Design: A phone survey of 504 teen (age 16-20) and 409 adult (age 25-45) drivers in the US state of Alabama was conducted. Results: Teen drivers reported engaging in risky driving behaviors more frequently than adults, and male drivers reported engaging in risky driving behaviors more frequently than female drivers. Positive affect (liking for the behavior) and risk perceptions were negatively correlated in both samples, supporting predictions derived from the affect heuristic (i.e., the belief that things one enjoys doing are not risky). Individuals who reported the strongest relationship between positive affect and lowered risk perception across all behavior were the most likely to report engaging in risky behavior. This relationship was stronger for teen than adult drivers, and for male than female drivers. Conclusions: These findings represent a new approach to examining reasoning about risk in young drivers. Results suggest that focusing on risk perception or affective correlates of driving may have promise for reducing risky driving."

A Look at Objectivity in the Second Iraq War,"Fairness, Balance, Objectivity","This analysis builds on existing research regarding media objectivity and war coverage. It specifically looks to see how (and if) objectivity changed between the New York Times and the London Times newspapers during the current Iraq war, and the effect the July 7th subway bombings had on objectivity in the London Times. This content analysis finds that both papers tended to present a more objective  meaning the non-Coalition Forces side of the confliction  with the London Times often providing the more objective account. Further, the subway bombings proved to have a negligible, at best, effect on the London Timess coverage."

Conceptually we distinguished between the selection of errors that receive the attention, the detection of those errors, and the subsequent correction of the errors. To answer six related research questions, a questionnaire was created to identify and assess employees perceptions of organizational errors. Over 200 employees from a wide variety of organizations participated in the study. The research yielded four observations: First, work group dynamics appear to exert a different type of influence on error management norms than do organization-wide norms. Second, the data revealed what types of errors are on the radar screen of most organizations and what escapes notice. Third, the data suggest that demographic variables provide little explanatory power. Fourth, the data clearly suggest that well-led organizations have a wide, multi-dimensional radar screen. In contrast, poorly-led organizations have a narrow and limited radar screen."
2009-1694,"The ""Self"" as a Culturally Constituted Discursive Resource in Interventions",tudies in Cultural Meanings and Identities,,,,Paper,"The ""Self"" as a Culturally Constituted Discursive Resource in Interventions",Studies in Cultural Meanings and Identities,"While analysts are often focused on the more universal or theoretical features of identity as a construct, or developing a set of tools for investigating identity (certainly useful endeavors), cultural members live and work under their own assumptions about how identities are conceived and changed, and develop their own tools for working on them. This work then investigates the ways in which shared cultural knowledge functions to inform, bound, and motivate identity work in communication events and situations. Particularly, it investigates the cultural practice of intervention, where a group of collaborators exert social pressure to bring about change in another group member's perceived identity, usually when that member is deemed to be an addict, in need of help, who is likely to resist lesser persuasive attempts. In the exertion of this social pressure collaborators employ various discursive resources that rest on a set of shared cultural premises for their effectiveness, particularly premises about personhood, sociality, and communication. As a result, the investigation of the cultural foundations of identity work is essential for a proper understanding of the kinds of identity work a particular cultural configuration enables, and the ways in which each culture opens and restricts possibilities for working on identities in cultural scenes."
2009-1695,The Shadow of Excellence: A Jungian Approach to Public Relations Ethics,Top Student Papers in Public Relations,,,,Paper,The Shadow of Excellence: A Jungian Approach to Public Relations Ethics,Top Student Papers in Public Relations,"The paper suggests that the field of professional ethics might benefit from consideration of the ideas of Carl Jung (1875-1961) regarding wholeness instead of goodness as the goal of the integrated psyche. The whole self then becomes the basis for ethics in contrast to the ideal-typical (or Excellent) self at the heart of many approaches to professional ethics (Larson, 1977) and the dominant self-conception of public relations.
Interest in ethics is increasing as traditional deference to professionals diminishes (Arthur W.Page Society, 2007); discussion of different approaches reveals a search for deeper common values (Schweiker, 2004; Goodpaster, 2007), such as those sought by virtue ethics (MacIntyre, 1984; Oakley and Cockling, 2004), looking to intrinsic guidance for ethical behaviour. .The effects of the wider debate on public relations approaches to ethics are then considered.
In this context, Jungs focus on integration as a moral journey offers rich possibilities, combining philosophical and psychological approaches to the self and the ethical effects of moving away from the ego-defensive split between persona and shadow, ideas which are explored in the paper.
Finally, the implications of these ideas are tentatively applied to the emerging profession of public relations (PR) - in which the author has practised and taught for 30 years  raising questions such as whether the dominance of the Excellence model of PR (Grunig et al, 1992; Grunig, 2001) has fuelled the Shadow of deceit and manipulation and whether public relations ethics requires greater dialogue between these extremes."

In these entertaining yet religious dramas, which are typically staged during annual fiestas, idolsand masks of idolsfrom mass media are adeptly impressed to serve didactic, moral ends. To shed light on how media and mass culture inform popular religious understanding and performance in rural Michoacan, my paper describes how and why idols and ideals from mass media are incorporated into the pastorelas. Martín-Barbero (in Hoover and Lundby, Rethinking Media, Religion, and Culture) and others have suggested that in Latin America, mass mediation has encouraged the development of noveland sometimes transientforms of spirituality and religious practices that might compete with and undermine traditional communal values associated with institutionalized Catholicism. However, in this paper, I examine how popular Catholicism as practiced in Mexico/Latin America has also harnessed the images and tropes from the media and mass culture to fortify, renovate, and perpetuate itself. My account is woven together from two years of ethnographic fieldwork, which included observation of and participation in danzas, and dozens of interviews with organizers, participants, and audiences."

The essay proceeds by identifying three problematic assumptions of extant digital divide literature in the context of development: the discursive binarization between haves and have nots; the normatization of the digital divide; and the unproblematic representation of local community interests. The essay then uses a longitudinal case study of one particular Non-Government Organization (NGO) that attempted to develop a system of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) over a ten year period. Three phases of ICT development are identified: an initial phase, a growth phase, and a consolidation phase. The historical development of ICT in the NGO is used to interrogate the three assumptions of digital divide literature, highlighting its role in organizing digital zones. Implications for understanding digital divide and development issues are discussed."
2009-1698,The Social Identity Model of Media Usage and Effects: A Proposal to Integrate Agenda Setting and Reconciliation,Top Four Papers in Intergroup Communication,,,,Paper,The Social Identity Model of Media Usage and Effects: A Proposal to Integrate Agenda Setting and Reconciliation,Top Four Papers in Intergroup Communication,"This paper proposes an integration of the social identity model of media usage and effects with the agenda-setting theory. The contemporary media environment challenges traditional notions of monolithic issue agendas. Operating within a fractured media environment that caters to various social group needs and identities, traditional media theories fail to account for the development of group-level differences in issue agendas. While media communication research only identifies micro- and macro-level agenda-setting effects, this paper applies an intergroup perspective to media use, including the social identity model of media usage and effects, ethnolinguistic vitality, and conflict negotiation and reconciliation, to explain the potential for group-level differences. For instance, the use of social mobility and social creativity strategies in media selection leads to reinforcement of mainstream agendas, while use of a social competition strategy will lead to the formation of niche agendas. This integrated model accounts for the social context, the interdependencies of actors, and the motivations that play a role in the development of mainstream and niche agendas. The paper ends by discussing second-level agenda-setting and its relationship to intergroup conflict reconciliation in the media."

This study examines these trends within the public realm: the impact of wireless Internet use (wi-fi) on urban public spaces, wi-fi users, and others who inhabit these spaces. Through extensive observations of seven parks, plazas, and markets in four North American cities and surveys of laptop users in those sites, we explore how this new technology is related to processes of democratic participation, privatism, and social interaction. Findings reveal that wi-fi use within urban public spaces affords interactions with existing acquaintances that are more diverse than those associated with mobile phone use. However, the level of social diversity to which wi-fi users are exposed is less than that of most users of these spaces. Although urban public spaces are not a public realm for wi-fi users, the activities in which they engage do contribute to broader participation in the public sphere."
2009-1700,The Social Structure of Privacy in Sociotechnological Realms,Online Privacy,,,,Paper,The Social Structure of Privacy in Sociotechnological Realms,Online Privacy,"This project examines the influence of privacy on connectedness in online sociotechnological contexts. We examine the influence of privacy preferences on the social structure of online friendship networks using direct relational data from Facebook. We analyze whether individuals with high privacy-preferences are more or less embedded in their social networks. The results suggest that privacy does not influence the size, density, or positioning of individuals within a network, although there are unique signatures suggesting privacy may influence the clustering and compartmentalization of network groups. This is one of the first empirical studies of privacy from a social network standpoint, using actual data from online social network sites. New methodological approaches are introduced for the access and processing of large-scale network data from social network sites. In addition, the project expands conceptual frameworks for theorizing about privacy in communication contexts. These understandings contribute to both social theory and communication theory."

While previous research has shown that alternative blogs heavily cite traditional news media reports, this study analyzed the news sources in political blogs of U.S. national newspapers during the 2008 presidential election. A quantitative content analysis revealed that these j-blogs provide a much greater extent of original reporting than alternative blogs. However, it was also found that many j-blogs cite their print counterparts to promote print content online. They also use hyperlinks less frequently than alternative blogs and rely more on traditional forms of quoting sources."

A Content Analysis,"Global Women: Deconstructing Images, Changing Perceptions","In view of the stark contrast of womens roles and place in society before and after communism, this study sets two goals: to explore Eastern European women visual representations during communism and to analyze whether these representations were indeed indicative of the socialist emancipation propagated by the official communist party line. In doing so, this paper sets out to examine whether the media, and particularly, visual media representations played a role in perpetuating gender stereotypes in their coverage of women in the public and political discourse while at the same time, examine how the visual media presented the rather complex and conflict-wrought image of the socialist woman android. In addition, this study will embark on an exploration of how the images of the Soviet woman changed with the progression of the communist ruleform its inception to the demise of communism. In doing so, this study will track the qualitative and quantitative changes that took place in the visual presentation of women in order to examine how these changes might affect or reflect the changing gender roles of the post-communist transition."

We contend in our Standards for Openness Hypothesis that when women are avoiding with their partner and/or they think their partner is avoiding with them, it is more likely to make them dissatisfied than it is men because women have been socialized to maintain and identify problems in their relationships. More specifically, the hypothesis states that the discrepancy between how much people think their partner ought to be open with them (standards) and how much they perceive their partner is really open with them, will predict their dissatisfaction. This will be especially the case for women and will be exacerbated in conflict inducing situations. These standards are grounded in cultural and individual ideals for relationships. Because openness is equated with healthy relationships in the United States culture (Bochner, 1982; Parks, 1982), people are likely to equate avoidance with potential trouble areas in their relationships and ruminate about why they (or their partner) are avoiding, which should make them dissatisfied. We also argue that unmet standards for openness should also reduce womens commitment to their relationship, which should result in relational dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction, in turn, is likely to create an even wider communication gap or discrepancy between the standards for openness and reality."

2009-1705,The Strength of Causality on Narrative Persuasion in the Face of Contradictory Belief Structures,Mass Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Strength of Causality on Narrative Persuasion in the Face of Contradictory Belief Structures,Mass Communication Poster Session,"One of the few studies of narrative persuasion that investigate within-narrative variance found that information placed at causal locations within a narrative were more persuasive than non-causal locations. The current study submits this result to a test of external validity and attempts to measure the strength of causal location in the face of contradictory pre-existing belief structures. Using the strength of an individuals pro-environmental worldview as the competing belief structure, it was found that while the overall persuasion of contradictory narrative information decreased as strength of belief structure increased, the difference in persuasive influence between causal locations did not change. These results suggest that the relationship of causal location and narrative persuasion remains robust over a wide range of pre-existing conditions."
2009-1706,The Structure of International Migration,Global Communication and Social Change Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Structure of International Migration,Global Communication and Social Change Poster Session,"This study explores the structure of international migration and its relations to other political, economical and cultural networks using international migration data from the OECD (2005). A network analysis of 88 countries was used to evaluate a number of predictions about the relationship between migration and trade, GDP per capita, telecommunication, geographic proximity, language similarity and colonial ties. The results indicate that the network is composed of three groups with a United State-centered group, a United Kingdom-centered group and another Western European group. The G7 countries are at the center of the network. Major EU and OECD countries such as Australia, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Netherland, Belgium, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Korea and China are in semi-periphery positions. Most of Latin America, Asian and African countries are at the periphery. These cliques can be explained by the result of economic interdependency. Three hypotheses involving the relation between trade, GDP per capita and telecommunication variable were supported. However, other three hypotheses involving the relation between international migration and geographic distance, language similarity and colonial ties were not supported. Trade had the strongest correlation r = 0.46 (p = 0.001). In sum, economic relations among countries are the most important factor explaining international migration network."
2009-1707,The Study of Media Effects in the Era of Internet Communication,Mass Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Study of Media Effects in the Era of Internet Communication,Mass Communication Poster Session,"This paper examines what the shift in the channel of communication from traditional mass media forms, such as newspapers and television, to newer networked digital media forms means for mass communication researchers and media effects theory specifically. It does so by first considering what, exactly, is and is not new about newer media. It then focuses on how these similarities and differences between newer and traditional media impact and challenge some core media effects theories and approaches, including agenda-setting, cultivation, the spiral of silence, and communication campaigns. Finally, the paper offers guidance about future media effects theorizing in the era of Internet communication."

The diverse uses and intentions of the blog is discussed to create a context for the critical analysis. The script is interpreted from four primary theoretical sources: Morris semiotic, Burgoons deception, Korzybskis general semantics, and Burkes dramatism. The use of symbolic action from the script is analyzed to explain how the hegemony is developed. The privileged information of the author that pertains to the content of the blog is used as an empirical and evidentiary ground to demonstrate the creative non-fiction that the blog presents as factual: the distortion utilized to establish dominance by the lead blogger. To establish hegemony, the manipulations of the lead character (or hegemon) through the strategic manipulation of words and graphics that fail to correspond with facts and evidence are examined. Deception theory modified by a postulate of misinformation is used to reveal the uncritical and consensual nature of the bloggers to empower the blogger starring in the lead role. The powers and limits of blogs are summarized and highlighted in the critical study."

We use the term information behavior, which Wilson (2000) defined as the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information (p. 49), as an overarching concept to frame our exploration. We begin with an overview of UMT, including what it posits about the nature of uncertainty, uncertainty appraisals, the meaning of management, and the processes that are central to effective uncertainty management. We conclude this overview by presenting a series of nine principles (Brashers & Hogan, in press) that articulate the organizing framework of UMT. From there we transition to a discussion of information behavior. Drawing on the literature from a number of fields, we present three categories of information behavior: (a) information acquisition, (b) information handling, and (c) information use. Beyond accounting for information seeking and avoiding, these categories suggest a multitude of other information-based behaviors, the understanding of which may significantly contribute to the further development of UMT. We conclude with a reexamination of the organizing framework of UMT in light of the wider realm of information behavior and take stock of the practical implications inherent in such theoretical advances."
2009-1710,The Third-Person Effect in Israeli Womens Attitude to TV Commercials and Their Images,Race and Identity Matters to Feminists,,,,Paper,The Third-Person Effect in Israeli Womens Attitude to TV Commercials and Their Images,Race and Identity Matters to Feminists,"This paper reports the results of an extensive feminist reception study that examined, for the first time, how Israeli women interpret images of women and femininity in TV commercials. Adopting feminist and interpretive approaches, the qualitative study was based on in-depth personal interviews with Israeli women from diverse cultural, economic, and social backgrounds in an attempt to discover the differences in the way they read and relate to the texts and images in the commercials.
Grounded theory methodology, employed for analysis of the interviews, revealed unexpected expressions of the third-person effect in the womens discourse on the potential influence of the images on different categories of others. The paper presents this evidence and discusses its significance in the context of womens gender identity and consumerism in a capitalist society pervaded by advertising."

Through an empirical analysis of users comment exchanges, this study demonstrates how a group of interconnected Friends on MySpace engage in gendered and sexualized interactions through the use of various semiotic resources (i.e. text, images, video). In this particular network, articulations of affection are indiscriminatingly distributed among the Friends, creating multiple flows of polymorphous desire in which heteronormativity and binary gender are repeatedly challenged. From a theoretical perspective, it is argued that Judith Butlers notion of performativity is useful as an analytical lens when investigating these networked interactions. As the examples illustrate, the Friends make use of ironic and transgressive citations of sexuality and popular culture in order to be acknowledged as a member of the group, performatively delineating and shaping their collective network."

In order to show these changes, this document presents a campaigns analysis of the 2006s presidential process and a comparative analysis of this with the 1994s and 2000s. The conclusions are: There is no more one centre of the power as it happened in the authoritarian regime; Mass Media have broken the corporatist relation with the government, so nowadays media are a plural spectrum of powerful pressure groups; Nowadays the elector is changing, that means a primacy of independent voter and the soft voter over the hard voter. This research sustains that medias strategy of the 2006s campaigns was the main influence to the election."
2009-1713,The Unintended Consequences of Disclosure: Explicit Sponsor Identification on Smoking Cessation Ads,Persuasive Messages (High Density),,,,Paper,The Unintended Consequences of Disclosure: Explicit Sponsor Identification on Smoking Cessation Ads,Persuasive Messages (High Density),"The goal of this study was to determine a causal agent in the effects of smoking cessation advertising, the advertisement strategy or the identified sponsor. To this end, we manipulated the explicitly identified sponsor on public health and tobacco sponsored smoking cessation advertisements appearing in popular magazines between years 2002 and 2005. Two-hundred ninety-six adults participated in a fully crossed 3 (sponsor) x 2 (advertisement content) randomized experiment. Findings indicate that the content of public health advertisements was perceived to be more effective than the content of ads sponsored by a tobacco company. Additionally, we discovered that perceptions of credibility play an important role in how effective cessation ads are perceived to be. While public health campaign ads were perceived as more effective than ads from tobacco companies, placing a tobacco company as the sponsor of an ad severely undermines the perceived credibility of the ad. We also found evidence that this reduction in credibility can be partially overcome by a highly effective ad. Specifically, when Philip Morris replaced The American Cancer Society as the explicitly stated sponsor on the stronger ad content (public health ads), those ads were not perceived to be any less effective. However, placing the American Cancer Society on a tobacco campaign did not appear to elevate that campaign in terms of perceived effectiveness."
2009-1714,The Urbanizing of Everything: From Imaginations to Finance,CA Miniplenary: The City,,,,Paper,The Urbanizing of Everything: From Imaginations to Finance,ICA Miniplenary: The City,"The paper examines the sources for the growing significance of cities, especially global cities. These sources range from structural transformations in the economy (even mines and steel mills are buying more specialized services from urban based firms) to cultural shifts (urban music and literature). Finally, the city is a frontier space --encounters among people from different parts of the world, encounters among different subcultures. It makes legible possibilities and limits: for instance, the most advanced software is today embedded in all kinds of built environments and urban systems, and it is also in cities where the limits of these technologies become evident."
2009-1715,The Urban Keyword Unlocks Doors to Understand Cities and Communication,Keyword: Urban Communication,,,,Paper,The Urban Keyword Unlocks Doors to Understand Cities and Communication,Keyword: Urban Communication,"Urban is an often forgotten, but fruitful, keyword that opens the entrance to multiple scholarly disciplines and the practices of the multi-media of communication. This neglected, but nevertheless stand-by term offers an umbrella to shelter and solidify a focus on cities, community and communication.

Urban frames, references, citations and indices are like retrieval passwords that cross boundaries, connect and stretch across separate and multiple disciplines in their frequently disconnected intellectual, geographical, cultural and scientific turf and terrain, sprawl and space. Urban debate and direction provide a too seldom used, but a common historical platform for interaction and engagement in otherwise unasked, undeveloped and unresolved questions.

The urban keyword (used judiciously as a catch-word or by-word) challenges journalists and other applied media practitioners to match media forms to urban functions; and confronts urban scholars about research fad agendas dependent on social and technological forces and phases."
2009-1716,The U.S. Broadband Market Conditions and Barriers to Entry,Communication Law and Policy Poster Session,,,,Paper,The U.S. Broadband Market Conditions and Barriers to Entry,Communication Law and Policy Poster Session,"Despite the significance of competition for the universal access of broadband and new competitors, there is lack of research on how new competitors (or new entrants) with alternative broadband access technologies enter and serve the market and further, whether these entrants have been viable third competitors as the FCC has presumed. In addition, how the FCCs deregulatory competition policy influences these new entrants in the long run is another intriguing question. Recognizing the importance of competition for universal broadband deployment, this paper investigates entry barriers in the residential broadband access market, which damage market efficiency and delay the acknowledgement of universal access. This paper intends to examine how competitors with alternative access technologies have entered, competed, and more importantly, faced what types of obstacles that may disallow competitors to be a viable third competitor in the residential broadband access market from the perspective of barriers to entry and consequential historical entry."
2009-1717,The Use and Effectiveness of Negativity in Televised Debates,Debates,,,,Paper,The Use and Effectiveness of Negativity in Televised Debates,Debates,"Although televised debates belong to the most important campaign events in countries where they are being held, there is still a dearth of cross-national studies. This is particularly true with respect to research on both the rhetorical strategies used in, and the effects of, televised debates. Against this background, the purpose of this article is to study the use and effectiveness of negativity as a rhetorical strategy in televised debates in Germany and Sweden. Combining content analyses and experiments using real-time response measurements, the study finds that negative statements are common in both countries, and more so in Sweden than in Germany. With the exception of negative statements in Germany, the debates focused overwhelmingly on issues and policies rather than character. However, the study found no consistent support for the notion that negative messages are more effective than positive messages. There was one important exception though, suggesting the contingent nature of the effectiveness of negativity as rhetorical strategy used in televised debates."
2009-1718,The Use of Nonliteral Language Forms in Personal Blog Texts,Language & Social Interaction Poster Session,,,,Extended Abstract,The Use of Nonliteral Language Forms in Personal Blog Texts,Language & Social Interaction Poster Session,"The term blog  short for weblog  is a frequently updated website, most often centered around a single commentary theme or topic. Blogs may be similar to other forms of public expression, such as talk radio, in some ways and may share similarities with other forms of computer-mediated expression, such as email, in other ways. Nonliteral language use may differ in blogs from other previously explored media due to factors such as intended audience. Our present analysis explores the use of five common forms of nonliteral language in blog texts, and further examines how authors mark their nonliteral language with text-based discourse markers to highlight nonliteral intent. Analyses showed that hyperbole was the most common form used, that most nonliteral utterances are directed at a target, and that some of the less threatening forms of nonliteral language (like hyperbole) are marked with discourse markers less frequently. These results are discussed in relation to irony use in other communicative media, and with respect to how factors like intended audience may affect the authors use of nonliteral language."
2009-1719,The Use of Technology in Communication Between Reporters and Their Sources,Patterns in News Sourcing,,,,Paper,The Use of Technology in Communication Between Reporters and Their Sources,Patterns in News Sourcing,"Several significant groups of communication technologies, especially those employed by reporters to acquire news information, require development of a theory. While these technologies of epistemology participate in shaping the scope and quality of information that journalists are likely to obtain, generalizations concerning them are curbed by focusing research on a small subset of technologies, sometimes even on one technology alone.
This study is based on comprehensive research of all communication channels (technology-mediated and non-mediated) used in acquiring information for a random sample of stories published or aired by nine Israeli news organizations in three types of media, employing a series of face-to-face reconstruction interviews with the reporters who authored them. Findings reveal only marginal differences among media in the use of various communication channels. The dominant role of technology is to enable distant coverage while keeping close contact with human sources. Nearly all news information is technology-mediated, transmitted primarily via oral channels. Although reporters use the Internet extensively, their reliance on the World Wide Web as a news source is negligible, even among online reporters. Based on these findings, the study proposes an initial framework for a theory of epistemological technologies in news sourcing."
2009-1720,The Uses of Islam: U.S. Foreign Policy in the Muslim World and News Media Representations From 1945-2008,"lam, Culture, and Identity: Moving Beyond False Binaries",,,,Paper,The Uses of Islam: U.S. Foreign Policy in the Muslim World and News Media Representations From 1945-2008,"Islam, Culture, and Identity: Moving Beyond False Binaries","As is well documented, the US has had a contradictory and self serving attitude towards Islam and Islamist organizations since 1945, when it took over the reigns of power in the Middle East and North Africa from Europe. In the initial period, the US developed an Islam policy which sought to forge common religious links between Christian America and various Muslim countries; a construction based, moreover, on highlighting differences with the godless Soviet Union. Additionally, the US adopted a position of allying itself with and supporting Islamist groups which it viewed as a bulwark against secular nationalist and leftist forces. This strategy made political sense for the US in the context of the Cold War. However, once the Cold War was over, the USs former allies turned into enemies and terrorists. When friends become enemies, how does the news media respond? Do they critically interrogate these contradictions or simply report changing attitudes without a sense of irony? Research on foreign policy and the media suggests that the media typically follow the latter course and simply take their lead from the government. This paper will examine the newspaper of record in the US, the New York Times and discuss its coverage of Islam and Political Islam from 1945.

A search was conducted of the New York Times database from 1945 using the key terms Islam*, Muslim, and Moslem. It yielded about 500-800 articles every decade since 1945. This paper will examine how and when religious identity is deemed significant in the construction of news items by the Times. Additionally, it will examine the ways in which Islam gets tied to politics. For instance, in the period between 1945-50 it is India and Pakistan that dominate the data set being cited the most often in relation to Islam and the formation of two new nation states. The paper will then analyze later periods to examine how the association of Islam with politics shifts to other regions and how Islamists go from being allies to enemies within media discourse."

The paper will also elaborate on the theoretical relevance of media agenda-setting and framing in the context of the domestic and foreign news coverage of the primaries. The study examines whether foreign news coverage of the primaries is heavily influenced by U.S. news sources and mirrors the coverage of the primaries by U.S. news media organizations."
2009-1722,The Utility of Information and Communication Technologies in Organizational Knowledge Management,Organizational Communication Technology and Knowledge Management: Multiple Approaches,,,,Paper,The Utility of Information and Communication Technologies in Organizational Knowledge Management,Organizational Communication Technology and Knowledge Management: Multiple Approaches,"The utility of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in organizational knowledge management is both exaggerated and understated. The role of ICTs is exaggerated when their information processing features are viewed as equivalent to knowledge creation, transfer, and learning. The role of ICTs is understated when their remarkable potential for supporting situated practice is not recognized, appreciated, or exploited. To distinguish the most appropriate and potentially effective uses of ICTs for organizational knowledge management we offer a view of knowledge as situated practice, problem solving, and thinking, which emphasizes its fundamentally communicative nature. Within this frame, we discuss the circumstances under which ICTs are and are not well-suited for knowledge management. Due to their tremendous capacity to support organizational knowledge generation and sharing, we emphasize the value of contemporary web-based tools that have traditionally been viewed as outside the purview of organizational knowledge and knowledge management. We then identify the kinds of social, organizational, and practical issues that arise with the use of ICTs for knowledge management processes, and we suggest directions for future inquiry and application based on these observations."

The aim of the study, based on in-depth interviews with Dutch and Finnish television journalists working for both public service and commercial news programmes, is to provide insight into how journalists assess their use of emotion and the perceived emotionalising of news. The main question is how the journalists discourse about emotion is linked to their ideas of good journalism, as well as to their self-image."
2009-1724,The Value of Networks of Practice: The Role of Embeddedness and Media Use,Current Research on Organizational Networks,,,,Paper,The Value of Networks of Practice: The Role of Embeddedness and Media Use,Current Research on Organizational Networks,"This paper addresses the question what factors influence the value of Networks of Practice or NoPs. The discussion focuses on two sets of variables: the embeddedness of the network and the use of different media. In terms of embeddedness, three dimensions are distinguished: (1) embeddedness in practice: the extent to which the knowledge shared in the network is relevant for and integrated in members practices; (2) structural embeddedness: the extent to which network members are connected to each other and know who knows what and (3) relational embeddedness: the extent to which the network is characterized by strong social ties, as a mechanism for gaining fine-grained information. In terms of communication media, a distinction is made between an integrated ICT environment on the one hand, and face to face communication on the other. A survey study among members of different NoPs using the Viadesk ICT environment reveals that all three forms of embeddedness are important antecedents of value of a NoP (explaining 43% of the variance in value) and that these forms of embeddedness are interrelated. Further, we find that ICT use positively influences the networks embeddedness in practice, while face-to-face communication is primarily conducive to the structural and relational embeddedness of an NoP."
2009-1725,The Various Types of Interaction on Israeli Radio Phone-In Programs and the Public Sphere,Deliberation and Political Discussion,,,,Paper,The Various Types of Interaction on Israeli Radio Phone-In Programs and the Public Sphere,Deliberation and Political Discussion,"This paper typifies the different interactions on Israeli political radio phone-in programs. Based on general features of the interaction and of the host perceptions, six different types of interaction were found. The different types can be distinguished by two aspects, whether the interaction is based on agreement or disagreement and whether the participants engage each other in the interaction. The most prominent type of interaction is a two-sided disagreement interaction, in which hosts and callers argue about issues and problems. A similar type is that of the neutral interaction, in which hosts try to avoid expressing their opinions. Other types of interactions also occur in the programs, yet hosts often remark on their occurrence. These remarks serve to explain the interaction to the audience, to justify the hosts behavior, and to reprimand or compliment the caller. These remarks also suggest that hosts see these types as non-normative interactions, when compared to the two-sided disagreement and neutral interactions. The normative categories go hand in hand with the demands of a public sphere, showing that political radio phone-in programs in Israel contribute to the public sphere and to its democratic life."
2009-1726,The Violation of Prescriptive Stereotypes on Job Resumes,Organizational Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Violation of Prescriptive Stereotypes on Job Resumes,Organizational Communication Poster Session,"This article focuses on communal and agentic identity-images as embedded in job resumes, which are conceptualized as initial venues for self-presentational efforts. The results indicated that male decision-makers evaluated agentic female (vs. male) resumes more negatively (i.e., less likable, less competent, less socially skilled, less likely to be interviewed, and less likely to be hired), whereas their evaluation of communal resumes did not differ for female and male applicants. By comparison, female decision-makers evaluation of male and female applicants did not significantly differ as a function of resume identity-image conditions. Moreover, male participants ratings of agentic applicants social skills mediated the relationship between applicant gender and participants evaluation of applicants on hiring measures. The data add to prior evidence showing that women are viewed in more negative terms when perceived as violating gender stereotypic prescriptions, in this case, via the agentic or communal identity-image conveyed on their resume."

This study relies upon social construction theories of technology to examine the decade immediately preceding the birth of broadcasting, a period dubbed radios pre- history, and focuses on two wireless telegraph stations operated by Wanamakers department store. The previous historical record for these operations is vague and inconclusive. The goal of this research is to clarify the historical record, and also to illustrate how these stations functioned as precedents for later uses of electronic media."

The case of the Korean film, D-War (2007), is intriguing in that it strategically integrated both the local and the global across various aspects, such as narrative, genre, language, location, cast, staff, technology, and monetary resources, for the purpose of distributing to both a local and global audience. It is an example of what the authors refer to as ""strategic hybridization."" The main research questions address the strategic hybridization involved in the processes of production, marketing, and distribution, as well as the consequences of such hybridization in terms of audience reception in Korea and the US."
2009-1729,The Water Cycle or Media Attention Cycle? Water News Revisited,Framing and Framing Effects (High Density),,,,Paper,The Water Cycle or Media Attention Cycle? Water News Revisited,Framing and Framing Effects (High Density),"Historically speaking, water has been a vital social object for constant societal concerns in Spain. During the process leading to autonomy process, also known as political decentralization, water management became one of the central political issues for struggle between the 17 regional governments in the Spanish territory. In this context, the media, especially, the printing newspapers have been playing a key role on keeping the citizens informed of conditions of the water supplied into their households, which has to be fought for and paid for. In doing so, the media may help to shape the citizens knowledge on water and, consequently, guide or shift the public opinion on its management policies. The present study centers on content analysis of news coverage on water issues in the Spanish major nationwide newspapers in a forty-five year span. It is aimed to examine how the Spanish news media have helped sustain long term social debate about water in the public arena and keep alive citizens awareness of it."

The essay begins by discussing how conventional accounts of atmospheric destabilization helped to transform air space from a shared commons or military battleground into a commercial resource. The essay then discusses the influence of the televisual in this transformation and develops a more detailed understanding of the cultural forms employed by The Weather Channel. Three examples are treated: 1) the commercial transformation of National Weather Service (NWS) data in the 1980s, 2) the commercialization of forecasting models developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in the late 1990s, and 3) the recent advocacy orientation developed from Heidi Cullens climate expertise and in original programming like Forecast Earth. Lastly, the essay develops strategies for re-problematizing atmospheric destabilization through citizen oriented media practices."

It also outlines sequences and mutually enhancing driving forces which will be connected in distinct ways in the different culture-specific and transcultural key visual networks. It will probably last generations of technologies, media professionals and competent visual communicators until the language of Key Visuals will really be a world language. However, its chances are better than those of English and as good as those of music."

Routinely, parents are exposing babies to videos and television programming crafted specifically for this age group. This study seeks to ascertain why. What beliefs do parents hold regarding the marketing of such media and the expected benefits to their young ones? How does the use of videos such as Baby Einstein benefit the parent? Although parents reported that video creators want them to think the videos are educational, they are skeptical. However, they continue to let babies watch this safe content. Of the 28 parents interviewed for this project, only four claimed to always watch with their child; the remainder of parents used video time to do household chores. Overwhelmingly, parents heard positive comments about videos from fellow parents, but rarely heard from their pediatricians about possible negative effects on the under-twos."
2009-1733,The Yellow Press: Asian American Radicalism and Conflict in Gidra - ERIC Top Paper,Dialogues and Conflicts: Points of Contact in Media Production and Policy,,,,Paper,The Yellow Press: Asian American Radicalism and Conflict in Gidra - ERIC Top Paper,Dialogues and Conflicts: Points of Contact in Media Production and Policy,"This paper examines the Asian American student newspaper Gidra, which was published from 1969-1974, as a way of advancing our notions of the role and function of ethnic media within minority populations. Studies of ethnic media rarely include radical papers, as it is theorized that ethnic communities have a vested interest in avoiding coverage of conflict. However, the importance of Gidra in terms of Asian American identity construction and contribution to activist movements cannot be overlooked, particularly with regard to conflict. I investigate the publication through three categories: external conflict, internal conflict, and productive conflict created by the paper itself. This counters the notion that ethnic media shy from covering conflict, and importantly contributes to our understanding of the history of the Asian American Movement as it was shaped by the radical press."
2009-1734,Thinking Outside the Clocks: The Effect of Layered Task Time on Creative Autonomy in Meetings,Work Meetings as Constitutive Organizational Phenomena: Multidisciplinary Research,,,,Paper,Thinking Outside the Clocks: The Effect of Layered Task Time on Creative Autonomy in Meetings,Work Meetings as Constitutive Organizational Phenomena: Multidisciplinary Research,"The turbulence of the new economy has put demands on organizations to increase their ability to respond rapidly to changing environments with flexibility and creativity. Meetings are one of the organizational sites in which organizational actors do creativity. Paulus (2000), for instance, shows interaction in groups can be an important site for generating creative ideas and brainstorming. Blount and her colleagues (Blount 2004) have demonstrated the importance of organizational temporalities for group performance. Our research draws on both of these and asks how the temporal structure of organizations impacts creative autonomy within groups. Specifically, we develop hypotheses linking an organizations temporal structure to creative autonomy in meetings. Rubin (2007) posits a new temporal structure called layered-task time , characterized by simultaneity, fragmentation, contamination, and constraint.

A Look at Uncharted Processes in Media Effects Research,,,,Paper,Thinking While Viewing: What Thoughts During Viewing Can Tell Us About Narrative Experiences and Effects,Above and Beyond? A Look at Uncharted Processes in Media Effects Research,"Persuasion research has long recognized counter-arguing as a commonly used and effective strategy for resisting persuasive messages (e.g., Jacks & Cameron, 2003; Petty & Cacioppo, 1979; Petty, Tormala, & Rucker, 2004). Counter-arguing typically is defined as the generation of direct rebuttals toward an overtly persuasive message or in response to a counter-attitudinal statement (e.g., Jacks & Cameron, 2003; Slater, Rouner, & Long, 2006; Wellins & McGinnies, 1977).
However, in the context of narrative persuasion, where persuasive intent is not necessarily obvious to the audience member, counter-arguing requires a broader definition. Indeed, detecting what thoughts are generated while engaging with a narrative is complex because of the range of possible thoughts. Yet, asking viewers to recall what they think about while watching a television program can provide insight into judgments about programs, viewing experiences and cognitive and emotional processes involved in engaging with filmic narratives.
The present paper will report on two studies that use different thought listing techniques. Result of the first study indicate recollection of thoughts about emotions (characters and audience members) was related to increased realism, increased enjoyment, and the application of story themes to real world perceptions (e.g., men have difficulty with emotions, more help should be available to victims of disasters). Conversely, thoughts reporting a criticism or negative evaluation about characters or events were related to decreased realism and lower engagement while viewing.
In a second study participants were prompted to counter argue by looking for flaws, inconsistencies or obvious product placement while viewing. Searching for flaws decreased engagement and reduced acceptance of an underlying theme of the program, sympathy for victims of violence.
The present paper has two purposes. One is to further explore the relations among different types of thoughts and other variables such as engagement, realism, enjoyment, and acceptance of story-related beliefs and perceptions. The second is to explore the topics and targets of emotional and critical thoughts. Discussion will be framed in reference to narrative processing and narrative persuasion."
2009-1736,Third Person Effect in Relation to Media Coverage of Virginia Tech Shooting Incident in April of 2007,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,,,,Paper,Third Person Effect in Relation to Media Coverage of Virginia Tech Shooting Incident in April of 2007,Korean American Communication Association Research Panel,"The current study examined the third person effect (TPE) in relation to media coverage of the shooting incident at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, commonly known as Virginia Tech. This study investigated whether three groups (non-Korean Americans, Korean Americans, Koreans living in the US) differed from one another in the amount of media influence they perceived on the American public and on the Korean American public compared to themselves. Additionally, the current study examined the extent to which individuals focus on the shooter and their perceptions of media bias were related to TPE. The results showed support for TPE in terms of media coverage resulting in negative feelings toward Korean Americans and Koreans. Individuals focus on the shooter and their perceptions of media bias against Korean Americans were positively related to the extent to which individuals perceived greater media influence on the American public than on themselves for media coverage of the incident generating negative feelings about Koreans and Korean Americans (i.e., American TPE for Koreans and Koreans Americans)."
2009-1737,This Is Not a Pipe: Approaches to Cross-Cultural Visual Competence,"Keywords: Culture, Communication Competence, and Intercultural Communication (Cross Unit)",,,,Paper,This Is Not a Pipe: Approaches to Cross-Cultural Visual Competence,"Keywords: Culture, Communication Competence, and Intercultural Communication (Cross Unit)","The meanings of visuals are taken for granted. We perceive an image, and automatically attribute meaning to it. On top, we assume that other people attribute the same meaning to the same visual. But: Meaning-attribution is depending both on situational and cultural contexts as well as on intra-individual predispositions like prior experience with the visual type and motif. Taking recent cartoon controversies as an example, but also different reactions to atrocity images like e.g., the Abu Ghraib torture pictures, it becomes apparent that the immediate text accompanying the visuals, and the cultural background in which they are perceived, influence both meaning-attribution and emotional reaction to the same visuals.
After a general introduction into the very recent theories of visual competence and visual context analysis the focus of the paper will be on cross-cultural understandings and misunderstandings that have their origin in visual communication. The paper will conclude with a first suggestion on how to integrate cross-cultural contexts into the theoretical framework of visual meaning-attribution, and a first attempt on how research in visual communication can help to develop solutions to conflicts and crises sparked by visuals."
2009-1738,This Is Your Brain on Interactivity: Alpha-Blocking While Processing Online News,Keywords in Information Systems: Interactivity (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,This Is Your Brain on Interactivity: Alpha-Blocking While Processing Online News,Keywords in Information Systems: Interactivity (High Density),"This extended abstract shares emerging EEG (brain wave) data from a pilot study exploring information-processing differences between interactive and non-interactive news stories. On the one hand, interactivity can be seen as most other structural features of mediaprocessed automatically. But, given that they constantly call for user action, interactive news segments compel greater user involvement and are therefore more likely to be processed consciously than automatically. Alpha-blocking data were collected from seven study participants while they read both interactive and non-interactive news stories on the website of The New York Times. A preliminary examination of the data appears to lend support to the former proposition. Although participants perceived interactive stories to be more interactive and interacted with it more, EEG data suggest that they paid more conscious attention to non-interactive stories, lending not only theoretical insights into the nature of information processing on the Web, but also practical advice for designers."

This study used the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), a theoretical framework for designing health risk messages, in a content analysis of newspaper articles about heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The analysis identified the presence of threat and efficacy messages in articles, the framing techniques used to convey these messages, and the differences between articles about heart disease and diabetes. This study revealed that the vast majority of articles about disease prevention may fail to have a positive effect on behavior. Echoing previous research, articles about diabetes tended to emphasize race or ethnic origin in the context of susceptibility to the disease."
2009-1740,Through the Looking Glass: A Decade of Red Cross Crisis Response and Situational Crisis Communication Theory,t Is Not Our Fault: Crisis Communication In Public Relations,,,,Paper,Through the Looking Glass: A Decade of Red Cross Crisis Response and Situational Crisis Communication Theory,It Is Not Our Fault: Crisis Communication In Public Relations,"Crisis communications has emerged as a hot topic in public relations literature. However, little attention has been paid to nonprofit organizations (NPOs), one of the largest sectors of public relations practice. In particular, few studies have examined the crisis response strategies NPOs can employ to repair their reputations. For the Red Cross and other NPOs, when faced with a crisis, communicating with their publics is critical to restoring a positive reputation and, ultimately, to the continued success of the organization once the crisis has passed.
The paucity of research on nonprofit crisis response strategies provided the impetus for the research presented in this paper. The study was based on the work done by Coombs (2007) to develop and refine what he has called the Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT). The theory posits that certain public relations crisis situations are better resolved if organizations adopt specific crisis response strategies.
Mainly through experimental studies, researchers have shown that favorable impressions about organizations, both for-profit (Coombs, 2006, Yang and Grunig, 2005) and nonprofit (Fussell Sisco, 2008), vary significantly when subjects are exposed to different response strategies employed by such organizations in crisis situations. The study presented in this paper examined the crisis response strategies of the American Red Cross through the lens of the SCCT."

While there was benefit to society in bringing the issue of sexual predators to the publics agenda and facilitating the arrest and conviction of some sexual predators, the detriment that Dateline NBCs To Catch a Predator did was far greater through the deception they employed and the methods they used.

This study analyzed newspaper coverage of Senator Hillary Clinton in the wake of the New Hampshire primary. Based on framing theory, the analysis examined the dominant frames used to portray Clinton as well as the use of attribution, adjective, and adverbial bias in the news coverage. The results show that the coverage focused mostly on masculine traits and used predominantly masculine framing. Implications of the findings are discussed in the context of media portrayal of women and politics."

How do we go from human or material actionwhat we can directly observeto organizational action? We suggest that in order to act, the organization must appropriate action, and that this is made possible through the attribution of action to the organization. This reverses the line of thinking of some authors, for whom organizations delegate actions to their human members. On the contrary, we propose that the organization is constituted by the actions it appropriates. Our proposal draws on authors such as Tarde, Whitehead and Simondon, who propose that being can be understood in terms of having: what the organization possesses is what makes it up. Using examples drawn from a documentary on military wives in Canada, we examine how appropriation and attribution are used to include or exclude these women from the army, and to grant or deny them rights or services."
2009-1744,Tolerated Bodies,Body Talk (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Tolerated Bodies,Body Talk (Cross Unit),"What potential, as well as entrapment, can come from a body imagined as an object of tolerance? A bare body emerges at the edge of liberal policies that recognize its human rights but nonetheless regulate and subjugate it. Around the ambiguation of that bare body, I argue, lies a zone of tolerance where incivility is abhored yet also where liberal governmentality is endorsed and legitimated.

Taking my cue from Wendy Browns Regulating Aversion, I explore the contradictions surrounding tolerance as it arises from human rights legal discourse, which imagines the bare body as variously marked by color, wounds, genital functions and alterations, religious adornments, and so on. These are the sites through which tolerance enacts governmentalist norms, which manage and regulate the bare body for the good of the state."

In this context, the paper deals with two questions: What is the proportion of foreign news in each country and are the same topics privileged in domestic and foreign news? The paper also analyzes the scope and potential impact of the events in a given country in terms of how they were reported in other countries. We expect that foreign news items that have clear national consequences will receive more prominence. The focus here is on several questions: Is the prominence of an issue  measured, for example, by the duration of the item and the presence of an on-site reporter  the same across countries? Do relevance variables such as impact and political status of the actors affect the prominences? Do experts make that potential impact explicit?"

The study first explicated the concept of professionalism and the objectives of Olympics coverage. A survey questionnaire was designed accordingly to measure a sample of the Chinese professionals who were part of production team of the international TV signal for the Beijing Olympics. Results indicated that production professionals were well prepared and were in line with the Olympics ideals. Less clear-cut were the concepts of motion and emotion in Olympic coverage. Implications were discussed.

This paper is an analysis of the companys headquarters, Googleplex. While the companys presence on the Web leaves little for a critical analyst to approach, its headquarters has more to offer. The aim of the paper is to use the example of Google to explore how power is performed and organized in an informational culture and to investigate how the architecture of the Googleplex represents and takes part in this performance of power. The analysis shows that the Googleplex is active in both establishing Googles claim to power  through utilizing different techniques related to the concepts of information, decentralization and self-organization  and at the same time downplays the centrality that is thus achieved."
2009-1748,"To Tell the Truth: Epistemology, Ethics, and Technology","Keyword ""Truth"": Philosophy, Communication, and Technology",,,,Paper,"To Tell the Truth: Epistemology, Ethics, and Technology","Keyword ""Truth"": Philosophy, Communication, and Technology","One of the persistent and fundamental philosophical questions asked of emergent forms of information and communication technology (ICT)like the Internet, social networking, and web 2.0 applicationsis whether the data that is contained and conveyed by these systems is truthful and trustworthy. This question, however, already makes a number of assumptions about the nature of truth, the manner of its communication, and the function of ICTs that may or may not be true. This essay examines the concept of truth that has been assumed by and operationalized in the field of communication studies. In doing so, it does not examine any particular truth or the truth that is conveyed by a specific mode or medium of communication. Instead it seeks to uncover and investigate the general concept of truth that already underlies and informs these various circumstances. Toward this end, the investigation is divided into three parts. The first part considers the often unquestioned theory of truth that has been deployed in and is constitutive of the discipline of communication studies. The second takes up and explicates a complication that necessarily affects this traditional understanding from the very beginning. And the third part examines the consequences of this development, demonstrating how it entails a restructuring of the concept of truth, the perceived role of technology, and the objective and conduct of communications research."
2009-1749,Toward a Comprehensive Causal Process Model of Media Selection,Media Selection,,,,Paper,Toward a Comprehensive Causal Process Model of Media Selection,Media Selection,"While many previous studies have dealt with the media selection process, most of those studies are grounded in organizational studies and information science, and generally focus on media selection for effective communicative interactions or transmission of information. As such, message characteristics are key components of their media selection models. However, we do not use the media only in our organizations or to interact with other people; they indeed serve a variety of other functions in our lives such as escape, surveillance, and entertainment. In this paper, a tentative model of media selection in non-organizational settings and for non-interactive purposes is proposed. It take users needs as a starting point and combines various theoretical approaches, most notably uses and gratifications and social cognitive theory."

Represented as a graphic model, PCE illustrates the circular flow of information and communication across mediums, channels, and individuals. This provides a conceptual tool with practical applications for teaching as well as research."
2009-1752,Toward a Simple Science: Comparing Popular Visual and Verbal Science Messages in Meteorology,Visual Expertise/Education and Issues of Globalization and Popularization,,,,Paper,Toward a Simple Science: Comparing Popular Visual and Verbal Science Messages in Meteorology,Visual Expertise/Education and Issues of Globalization and Popularization,"Both the deficit model of communication as well as the dominant view of popularization suggest that scientists and journalists simplify their popular science communication messages. Most research in this area focuses on written or spoken messages especially as it pertains to newspaper or media content. To date, limited research has been conducted to see if other modes of communication fall under the same simplification process. This paper explores whether scientists and journalists simplify science visuals in the context of meteorology, specifically using hurricane graphics. Three main areas are explored using 19 in-depth interviews: first, how do meteorologists characterize their audience in terms of education level; second, how do meteorologists change their verbal message, if at all, based on their audience analysis; and lastly, how do meteorologists create their visuals in response to their audience analysis. Findings from this research show that the simplification process may not be applied to visual information in the context of meteorology. Despite meteorologists low expectations for their audiences science education level, weather visuals remain extremely complex requiring the ability to interpret intricate probabilities and complex scientific processes. The reasons why meteorologists may not simplify complex visuals and the potential implications of communicating complex visuals to the public are discussed."
2009-1753,Towards a Dialogic Model of the Cinematic Experience,Top Papers in Visual Communication Studies,,,,Paper,Towards a Dialogic Model of the Cinematic Experience,Top Papers in Visual Communication Studies,"The cinematic experience is often characterised as a hermetic illusion. Viewers feel as if they are present in another world, having lost awareness of the film as an artefact and of the filmmaker behind the screen. This characterisation is problematic because viewers must be assumed to perceive cues from the film narrative in order to sustain the illusion. The communicative model underlying the description of the cinematic experience is essentially monologic. In this paper it is investigated whether and how the communicative model can be altered and how to allow for the filmmakers intentions to transpire in the cinematic experience without destroying the magic of apparent presence in another world. The communicative model underlying the cinematic experience is proposed to involve a two-way process based on a shared understanding of how the film experience comes about. It is argued that such an understanding is more beneficial to the viewer than a complete surrender to a hermetic illusion. The communicative model is specified further as joint sense-making in which coordination between participating agents takes the form of joint orientation. By comparing film narration with conversational storytelling it is shown that communication in the cinema can be regarded as a form of dialogue, to be more precise as asymmetric off-line dialogue. Finally, the cinematic experience is sketched as layered, with the illusion being the content of focused reflective awareness, and the interaction being mostly diffusely and unreflectively conscious."

A disadvantage associated with the adoption of holistic definitions of health is the paucity of interdisciplinary inquiry. As was the tendency in science, Chandler, Holden, & Kolander (1992) noted a bias in the wellness research for disciplines to use definitions and language that was applicable only to their own field of research. For instance, medical and health education fields emphasize physical wellness, while counseling emphasizes emotional, social, and occupational wellness. As in research on spirituality, holistic health studies have failed to build upon prior research (MacDonald, Friedman, & Kuentzel, 1999). The result has been a lack of empirical progress towards a universal lexicon for the holistic health perspective. This presentation will explore the three constructs part of the expanding definition of health: health, wellness, and spirituality; as well as their role in shaping interdisciplinary inquiry."

One of them is the trainer of the German national soccer team who, in an interview, dismisses journalistic work as unbelievable rubbish. The second case studies Jon Stewart accusing the hosts of CNNs Crossfire of partisan hackery. The third case explores an interview with a German ex-hostage in Iraq who voices her preference for Al Jazeera on German television. My goal is to theorize the appearance of such media rebels on television. Using the media events (Dayan & Katz, 1992) and media scandals (Lull & Hinerman, 1997) approaches as starting points, I suggest that a media incidents theory can be developed. This emerging concept introduces a new class of media occurrences which perform, it is argued, a much more critical function for citizens in todays media-saturated societies than both media events and scandals."
2009-1756,Towards a Model of Experimentation With Identity-Seeking Behaviors,"dentity, Esteem, and Support in Interpersonal Encounters",,,,Paper,Towards a Model of Experimentation With Identity-Seeking Behaviors,"Identity, Esteem, and Support in Interpersonal Encounters","In this paper, I propose a model of experimentation with identity-seeking behaviors. To better understand their own identity, individuals may engage in a process of experimentation. The behaviors that individuals experiment with will thus be referred to as identity-seeking behaviors (ISB). Identity-seeking behaviors are part of a dynamic stage in which individuals are not yet ready to recognize a behavior as indicative of a larger self-identity. For example, if a woman believes she may be a lesbian, but is not sure, she may first experiment with certain behaviors, such as engaging in sexual activity with another woman, as a way of reducing her uncertainty about her own identity. The example of sexual identity experimentation is used throughout this paper.

This paper takes a novel approach by drawing from various theoretical approaches across the discipline, including Uses and Gratifications, Strength of Weak Ties, and Uncertainty Management Theory. In this model, it is proposed that individuals will either experiment through online and media sources (passive strategy), a weak tie to the identity they are considering (active strategy), or by reducing their uncertainty by acting in ways representative of the identity (interactive strategy). It is posited that the type of strategy used will be directly tied to the amount of stigma towards the identity-seeking behavior and the ability of the experimenter to deny that the behavior is indicative of the identity in question. Ultimately, this paper presents a new way of understanding identity formation through various communication processes."

This study added an additional marketing communications model and expanded the population to include public relations, advertising, and marketing practitioners and government communicators. Results largely confirmed the models found in the previous study (Holtzhausen, Petersen, & Tindall, 2003) and found support for the marketing communications model. Also, a sixth model, the Change Agent Model, emerged and was the model with the highest mean. The results show that the use of these models are stable across job and organization types, which provides support for applying theoretical constructs across different communication disciplines in order to build the field of strategic communication. Personal attributes such as sex and worldview did not affect practice in this study, which points to an audience-centered approach to communication and the professionalization of the field in South Africa."

This paper advances two basic propositions: first, that deliberative participation in public affairs, or deliberative politics, is a form of democratic participation; second, that democratic citizen deliberation is central to public opinion. So our understanding of democracy in Africa should benefit from theoretically-driven explanations of the processes of public deliberation. Of particular interest are the deliberative systems through which public opinion is nurtured, fomented, and expressed. In this analysis, deliberative system refers to the structures, institutions, and processes of everyday talk. Although this notion admittedly implies a more expansive definition than the meaning traditionally attached to the concept of deliberation, it signals a more appropriate and useful way of looking at citizen deliberation in Africa, as elsewhere."

A theoretical schema from several overlapping literatures including evolutionary psychology, social neuroscience, fundamental personality, and communication are examined to make the case that high-affection communicators have greater relative electrical activity in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) versus the right PFC reflected in asymmetrical baseline EEG recordings. Participants (N=16) reported trait-affection levels using Floyds (2002) TAS-G, which measures an individuals threshold for expressing affection. Participants baseline electrical activity was then recorded. Asymmetry was operationalized as the difference between microvolt (µV) values of laterally opposed electrode clusters thought to measure PFC activity. Correlations and a discriminant analysis are consistent with the hypothesis that high-affection communicators have greater relative left PFC activity. Data indicate that sex also covaries with asymmetrical processing. Possibilities for further investigation and weaknesses of the current study are discussed in detail."

A Diachronic Analysis of Five European Countries,Factors Shaping the News,"This paper analyzes the transformation of media structures and possible effects on public communication from 1960 to 2005. To build a basis for the evaluation of trends and situations in the various models of media and politics (Hallin/Mancini 2004), this paper will systematically analyze and compare the cases of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland (democratic-corporatist), Great Britain (liberal) and France (polarized-pluralist), by classifying media suppliers and media supply with an etic approach. By this, we can show the large (but not necessarily linear) transformation of media structures: differentiation of the press from its former political and social ties, more press concentration and generally more tabloidization. Against the background of increasingly commercialized media systems, this paper argues for a research design that connects the structural and content side of the media, presenting indicators and first results of an ongoing comparative content analysis."

Then, it will show how the comparative and the cross can indeed become viable and relevant strategies for research conduct, even when we think beyond the binary of the national versus the global. The paper will develop this discussion by looking at the case of diasporic media cultures, which are shaped at the meeting of transnational networks and urban cultural practices. It will draw from empirical material from three research projects with urban diasporic audiences, diasporic media cultures in Europe and transnational Arab audiences and it will suggest that we have to deconstruct and revisit the taken-for-grantedness of 'the national' as a given scheme for comparative research, without turning to the global as another given and set alternative. Instead, the paper suggest that we need to adopt a cosmopolitan outlook that enables the development of conceptual frameworks and methodological strategies that allow us to go beyond either/or (Beck, 2006) and to record and analyse this and that and 'neither/nor'."
2009-1768,Transnational Media and National Connections,"Globalizing Journalism: Where, How, How Much, So What?",,,,Paper,Transnational Media and National Connections,"Globalizing Journalism: Where, How, How Much, So What?","Stephen D. Reese holds that Kai Hafez is correct in arguing that communication scholars have over-emphasized media globalization in their euphoric attempt to make their subject the center of the inquiry. There are still barriers to news flows and cross-border communication. National propaganda (such as the pro-Iraq War media drumbeat) still seems to have impact. He will analyze media globalization as a network phenomenon, looking beyond flows and audience habits to logics, synchronized engagements, and emerging professional normative standards. Global journalism, for example, means that journalism, as an interpretive community, must navigate between a vertical orientation within their various nation-states and a horizontal perspective that connects them professionally. These kinds of developments have not been engaged adequately with empirical measures but are key concepts that need that attention.
Media globalization has been a slippery concept, but globalizing journalism at least means that the creators, objects, and consumers of news are less likely to share the same national frame of reference. To the extent that certain transnational media, such as CNN, emphasize this approach to news, we may call it ""global journalism,"" but we should not overemphasize these transnational media phenomena, the extent of cross-border flows, and the likelihood that national and linguistic barriers will disappear. Nevertheless, the cultures of journalism, although still strongly linked to their host political cultures, have had their national connections weakened. If the national political system is less able to influence news media coverage, on what basis should global journalism function?"

Dervins Sense-Making Methodology (SMM) is an ideal approach for exploring the ways in which successful interdisciplinary researchers make sense of and position their interests within multiple disciplines as they conceive and pursue their studies. The setting for this SMM-based investigation is a large public university that has recently committed $25 million to research development, including establishing a new Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity and funding six collaborative research clusters involving 71 faculty members across more than 30 departments."
2009-1770,Triangulation of Methods: The Key to Analyze Visuals and Production Contexts,Visual Expertise/Education and Issues of Globalization and Popularization,,,,Paper,Triangulation of Methods: The Key to Analyze Visuals and Production Contexts,Visual Expertise/Education and Issues of Globalization and Popularization,"This paper shows how an interdisciplinary research design and the triangulation of methods enhance the possibilities for analyzing complex phenomena from various perspectives.
We claim that such a procedure is necessary to avoid one sided and or abbreviated research. This is especially relevant for subjects that can be characterized as complex and diverse. Besides other disciplines and subjects of interest, this assumption particularly applies to studies in the fields of communication- and media sciences.

The mediaisation of society and the increase of visuals, require an appropriate scientific examination. With the concept of iconic turn (Boehm, 1994) and pictorial turn (Mitchell, 1995) a new paradigm was set. Subsequently, scholars from various disciplines refer to these paradigms, thereby not only requiring the integration of the visuals into research. The visual itself, visual culture, as well as the production and reception processes are the subjects of interest.

Exploring these matters prove to be challenging. What are the appropriate methods and procedures? One soon will recognize that in many cases the limitation on one discipline and method would not be appropriate for the subject, nor does it generate satisfying results. Analyzing complex systems and networks of dependencies require a holistic approach, and therefore the researcher must hurdle over certain disciplinary boundaries. Even though this procedure might contain difficulties, the gain overweighs them. With an example from our recent research, we will illustrate which fields become accessible though the combinations of methods the fields of visual communication, biographical research and biographical media research."

The classroom is a site of great potential for discussions on the broader implications of technoscientific practice that are frequently missed by disciplinary formations of ""ethical"" conduct. Of the popular media available to teachers, Sci-fi is a particularly powerful tool. By positing alternative futures and worlds, Sci-fi can open up spaces for new ways of thinking about sensitive subjects such as gendered/racialized science, state control, privacy, dissent, and corporate power. By taking current patterns and practices to their ""logical limit,"" Sci-fi can facilitate critical engagement with technoscience at an early stage when such developments tend to be more amenable to intelligent, communicatively based, socially responsible guidance. Primarily based on analysis of syllabi and interviews with teachers and students, I conclude by offering suggestions regarding the most promising areas for the use of Sci-fi in a diverse array of teaching situations."
2009-1772,"Trust Me, I'm a Journalist: Shattered Glass and the Crisis of Trust in Liberal Journalism",Key Concepts in News and Journalism: Objectivity and its Adjacent Concepts,,,,Paper,"Trust Me, I'm a Journalist: Shattered Glass and the Crisis of Trust in Liberal Journalism",Key Concepts in News and Journalism: Objectivity and its Adjacent Concepts,"Central to the role of journalism in liberal democracies is the degree of trust extended by publics to its producers. To be authoritative, and thus to be the effective scrutineer of power, the witness to and analyst of complex reality, there must be trust in journalisms reliability, accuracy and honesty. The first decade of the twenty first century has seen a number of scandals in the news media which have undermined public trust in journalism, particularly the esteemed, quality journalism of leading media organisations such as the BBC, the New York Times and the New Republic. In the latter case, a young journalist named Stephen Glass succeeded in subverting a rigorous editorial process to have upwards of forty fabricated feature articles published before he was exposed as a fraud by an online periodical. This paper will use the film made about the case (Shattered Glass, Billy Ray, 2004) as a starting point to explore the dimensions of the broader crisis of trust in liberal journalism and the relationship between this crisis and the rise of online news media. Many observers have accused internet journalism of eroding normative standards of accuracy and reliability, but in this case, as the film demonstrates, it was an online publication which blew the whistle on an established US medium of record. There are many other examples of similar whistle-blowing by new media towards the old. Shattered Glass explores these tensions, and highlights the fragility of objectivity as a journalistic ethos in a highly competitive media market. This paper will develop these themes into a broader discussion of ongoing debates about Trust and what it means in journalistic terms, and how it can be preserved, in the digital era."

Using unique data about how a diverse group of young adults looks for and evaluates online content, our paper makes contributions to existing literature by highlighting factors beyond site features in how users assess the credibility of material they encounter on the Web. We show that the process by which a user arrives at a site is an important component of how the final destination is judged. In addition to search context, branding and routines also play an important role in this assessment as does a continued reliance on resources beyond Web sites including peoples social networks. We also discuss the fact that users differ considerably in their skills when it comes to evaluating online content. Finally, we identify areas for future research including a need for more valid survey instruments and continued work in more naturalistic settings."

For Karl Jaspers: ""The moment of communication is at one and the same time the presentation of and a search for the truth."" In historical terms, ever since communication took technological form in print and through its media revolutions until today, truth in the Western philosophical tradition has defined truth for communication ethics. Truth telling as a concept has revolved around correspondence and coherence views of truth. But with the digital era and its transnational scope, a credible understanding of truth for media ethics can no longer be grounded in the Western canon. Communication ethics for its future vitality needs to participate in the international, cross-cultural work on truth philosophically, and where relevant, from religious perspectives."

A 10 percent sample from the comments left on videos posted in June was included for analysis (N = 1577). Findings indicate that most comments are surface statements of support that do not seek to engage or interact with the campaign or other users. Recommendations call for refinement of measurement tools for more accurate measurement dialogic theory.

This study explored the relationship between individuals negative affect about their workplaces and their use of the popular television sitcom, NBCs ""The Office"" (a program that comically portrays unpleasant aspects of organizational life), as a means of managing their emotions. In light of media theory, the results suggest that people may indeed be using the program to manage their workplace related negative affect/stress. Specifically, this study found positive relationships between interaction with ""The Office"" (i.e., identification with, parasocial relationships with, and involvement in the program) and negative patterns of responding to dissatisfaction in the workplace (i.e., exiting the organization, silent suffering, aggressively voicing frustrations, neglecting their duties, and maintaining cynical attitudes)."
2009-1778,Turning Gray: Three News Zones and Fragmented Power Structure in China,"Ownership, Control, and the Freedom of the Press",,,,Paper,Turning Gray: Three News Zones and Fragmented Power Structure in China,"Ownership, Control, and the Freedom of the Press","Media autonomy is a continuous tension between journalists and the state in the authoritarian China. Different from 1980s when it was shown as direct state-journalists collision, such a tension contained more complicated patterns since the mid 1990s: news media maintained its aggressiveness to challenge the existing institutions without heads-on clash between the state and journalists. The paper argues that such coexistence of aggressiveness and stability is rooted in the emergence of fragmented structure in China. Six governmental reforms have changed the power balance between the central and local governments, among different departments and among various local governments. Traditional dichotomy of state vs. society needs to be modified. Meanwhile, commercialization differentiates news media and journalists, leading the state to shift its repressive control measures to defensive ones. As a result, logics of journalistic behaviors start to be differentiated into three zones: black, gray and white. The gray zone of news becomes the battlefield where journalists take advantage of the structural fragmentation in the power hierarchy to seek the breakthrough in news. This paper demonstrates this mechanism with four case studies: SARS in 2003; the Tin Mine Disaster in 2001, the closure of New Weekly in 2004 and the Anti-Para-Xylene project in 2007."
2009-1779,'Twas a Dark and Stormy: The Effects of Content and Structural Complexity on Processing News,Keywords in Information Systems: Cognitive Resources (High Density),,,,Extended Abstract,'Twas a Dark and Stormy: The Effects of Content and Structural Complexity on Processing News,Keywords in Information Systems: Cognitive Resources (High Density),"This study applies Shoemakers newsworthiness theory (Shoemaker, 1996) and the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP) (Lang, 2000; 2006) to the study of the ways in which audiences process audiovisual news coverage of tornados and storm damage. Shoemaker (1996) predicts that humans are hard-wired by biological instincts to pay attention to deviant or socially significant events and that increasing the complexity or the newsworthiness of stories increases audiences attention. The complexity of newsworthy stories, however, may be also be influenced by the structural features of those stories. The LC4MP posits that the structural complexity of an audiovisual messagethe amount of information introduced with each camera changeelicits orienting responses among audiences. Increasing the structural complexity of news messages would increase audiences arousal and attention. For highly newsworthy stories, however, the orienting responses elicited by structurally complex message features may overload available message processing resources. A 2 X 3 design will be used with the within subject variables of Content Complexity (Low/High) and Structural Complexity (Low/Medium/High). This study predicts that as the content complexity of news stories increases and as the structural complexity of messages increases attention (indexed by decreases in heart rate) and arousal (assessed by increases in skin conductance responses) will increase. There will be an interaction between structural and content complexity, however, such that the increases of structural complexity should continuously increase responses for low content complexity stories, but that increasing structurally complexity for stories with greater content complexity may contribute to overload."
2009-1780,Two Practices for Criticizing Food and Family at the Ceremonial Dinner Table,The Interactional Achievement of Family Roles and Family Relationships,,,,Paper,Two Practices for Criticizing Food and Family at the Ceremonial Dinner Table,The Interactional Achievement of Family Roles and Family Relationships,"Drawing on a large database of Thanksgiving, Easter, and Passover Dinners, this paper examines two practices for complaining about food at the family dinner table. First, I examine the practice of conversational digs, in which one communicator somewhat clandestinely raises a critique of food prepared by another. In responding to an initiating action (such as an inquiry, Are you okay) a speaker produces a strong disagreeing turn (such as No), and then accounts for the disagreement in a way that targets a co-present partys food (Im not eating my Moms fish again). This account carries, as an action secondary to accounting, a possible critique of that co-present party, or something associated with him or her (the food s/he has prepared). In this way, through the dig, a critique is raised somewhat clandestinely, carried as a secondary action on the primary action of accounting for a disagreeing response. Second, I show how a critique can be raised through what I call an occasioned noticing  an observation about food at the meal, for instance, also produced in second position, (such as noticing that the rolls are burned, in response to being offered one). The paper describes both the enactment of food criticism, and its trajectory in the responses of co-present parties. These practices for introducing critique provide a potentially somewhat delicate way for managing the raising of face-threatening or difficult matters, since they require further engagement by their producer, or other interactants, for these matters to become the focal topic of talk. The paper provides for further exploration of the enactment of disagreement and, more particularly, practices for raising and taking up or dismissing, critiques of co-present others among family members. Examining practices such as these that clearly have strong implications for social relationships provides an opportunity to add further depth to the literature on how family relationships are invoked, constituted and managed."
2009-1781,Two Strikes and a Foul Ball: One More Pitch for the Fairness Doctrine,Media Governance: Understanding Processes of Content Control,,,,Paper,Two Strikes and a Foul Ball: One More Pitch for the Fairness Doctrine,Media Governance: Understanding Processes of Content Control,"The FCCs Outlet Diversity Policy has become a proxy policy for promotion of the Commissions stated policy goal of viewpoint diversity. As some legislators, regulators and talk show hosts have discussed a possible return of the Fairness Doctrine following the 2008 elections, some scholars have argued that the Fairness Doctrine could be re-applied to broadcasters as a way to increase the diversity of broadcast content. While held as constitutional by the Supreme Court in the Red Lion decision, the FCCs 1985 Fairness Report provided the Commission cover, in public interest terms, for repealing the Fairness Doctrine. This paper explores the end of the Fairness Doctrine in three cases from the 1980s to determine if the Commission could reinstitute the Doctrine if it desired to do so. The author concludes, based on the decisions in Meredith v FCC and TRAC v FCC that while the Fairness Doctrine has two strikes against it, the holding in Syracuse Peace Council v FCC demonstrates that the courts have not called the doctrine out just yet."

It is based on a major study of Audience Material at the BBC, co-funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the BBC. A team of five researchers spent ten weeks in nine different newsroom across the BBC, both in London and across the United Kingdom, and as part of these observations undertook interviews with 115 journalists and ten senior editors. A typology of the different types of Audience Material is offered, along with descriptions of the different roles they play within the BBC, the tensions which exist between them, and the different attitudes journalists hold towards them. It becomes clear that news workers are enthusiastic about certain types, and perhaps unsurprisingly, these are the types which fit the traditional model of journalism: audience footage, audience comments and experiences, and are types of Audience Material which the BBC has always received, and used. However, there are certain key people based in individual newsrooms, and some holding senior management positions, who are also enthusiastic about types of Audience Material which challenge traditional models of journalism: collaborative and truly participatory models of journalism. But while it is true that there are a number of impressive examples of collaborative and participatory journalism that exist throughout the BBCs UK operations, most news journalists perceive UGC as simply another newsgathering tool."
2009-1784,Uncertainty and Communication in Couples Coping With Serious Illness,Uncertainty and Information Management: Reflections on the Current and Future State of These Constructs (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Uncertainty and Communication in Couples Coping With Serious Illness,Uncertainty and Information Management: Reflections on the Current and Future State of These Constructs (Cross Unit),"Communication can be both a source of uncertainty and a resource for managing uncertainty. Little research has addressed how couples communicate with one another to reduce uncertainty in the face of illness or how they coordinate their uncertainty management efforts. Consequently, basic descriptive questions need to be addressed: What challenges do couples face in coordinating their uncertainty management efforts? Does uncertainty motivate couple communication and mediate its effects? What strategies do couples have available for uncertainty management and what factors shape their use? In addition to strategic efforts, how can ordinary communication routines manage uncertainty?

This manuscript explores how couples coping with serious illness manage uncertainty. I have included the voices of participants in my research to give examples of theoretical issues. The Illinois Heart Care Project involved interviews with 25 patients and 16 partners of patients who had a myocardial infarction (MI, commonly referred to as a heart attack) and/or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) in the last year (for study details, see Goldsmith, Bute, & Lindholm, 2007; Goldsmith, Gumminger, & Bute, 2006; Goldsmith, Lindholm, & Bute, 2006). Recently, we completed additional interviews with 19 patients and 16 partners of patients treated for cancer in the last 5 years (see Goldsmith & Moriarty, 2008 for study details). I begin by discussing how couple interdependence creates distinctive coping demands, a phenomenon variously conceptualized as relational, communal, or dyadic coping. Then I discuss how these dyadic processes shape interrelated uncertainties about illness, identity, and relationships. Research on uncertainty management and dyadic coping strategies provide a basis for speculating how couples facing illness communicate. Finally, I suggest directions for future research. Throughout, I show how studying uncertainty in the couple-coping-with-illness context extends theory in two ways: (1) we consider not only individual but also dyadic uncertainty management, and (2) we find interrelationships among multiple types of uncertainty."

Did people answer dont know because of a lack of adequate knowledge (uncertainty) about the topic or because of conflicts between various beliefs (ambivalence)?
Using the subsample of Eurobarometer 64.3 survey collected from Germany, France, and the Great Britain, the top three countries with most governmental funding in nanotechnology in Europe, this study found that awareness of nanotechnology and general scientific knowledge reduced respondents likelihood of choosing dont know, indicating a function of uncertainty. In contrast, the results showed that the simultaneous existence of conflicting beliefs (e.g., nano is morally acceptable and nano is risky) prompted people to choose this no-attitude category, indicating a function of ambivalence.
Furthermore, public attitudes toward other technologies have carry-over effects on attitudes towards nanotechnology. In this case, uncertainty about genetically modified food and genetically modified plants both prohibited people from forming clear-cut opinions about nanotechnology."

Based on appraisal theory, we hypothesized that the effect of exposure to uncivil blog commentary on participatory behaviors would be mediated by negative emotions. We tested our hypotheses via an experiment drawing on a sample of adult readers of political blogs. Results showed that uncivil messages have an indirect effect on participatory behaviors through the arousal of negative emotions. That is, uncivil blog commentary has a strong initial effect on negative emotions. These negative emotions, in turn, influenced participatory behaviors. Our findings offer new insights on the role of media message tone within participatory democracy."

Several observations are made throughout the paper about the process and the benefits of conducting a study in an undergraduate class. The bulk of the paper addresses the actual research study conducted on public service announcements that focus on nutrition and their effect on preschool aged children. Repetition and realism are manipulated in the study. Repetition had a robust effect with healthier choices being made after viewing a public service announcement several times rather than once. The complexity of realism is discussed and several limitations are noted that call for more research on the topic.

In order to explore the underlying expectations between native-English-speaking teachers (NESTs) and their Korean students, personal narratives of experience were collected from 27 NESTs and 26 Korean university students. Through narrative analysis four categories of story types for NESTs and five categories of story types for Korean students were identified. When comparing these stories, it became clear that both groups were operating under a similar expectation that Korean students should be able to function entirely in English. This expectation indicates that in the globalized context of South Korea and English language classrooms, both teachers and students have assumptions about the English language. Critical reflection on the impact of these assumptions about English is necessary in order to better implement successful language education."

Media have had an impact on numerous social systems (i.e., politics, language, family, and work). The enhanced and accelerated capabilities that information communication technologies (ICTs) provide have intensified the need for constant participation in social systems. It is proposed that interpreting individuals' psychophysiological emotional responses to motivated media use within the media systems dependency framework will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of why individuals use media. The proposed method outlines a psychophysiological experiment that employs imagery generation."

In this study, we explore low-income, traditionally underserved womens perceptions of fertility-related norms by allowing women to describe in their own words their experiences with normative expectations. Results suggest that women are able to articulate and distinguish between descriptive and injunctive norms, that they often experience at least two different sets of injunctive norms (i.e., authoritative and peer-oriented), and that they compare these norms to their own and others behaviors. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of the extant literature exploring social norms in various health-related contexts."

Through structural equation modeling this study finds that religious beliefs, college science course and children in the home add predictive power to existing knowledge gap variables for determining civic scientific literacy."
2009-1792,Understanding Contributions to the Next Generation of Knowledge Management Systems,Communication and Organizational Knowledge: Issues for Theory and Practice,,,,Paper,Understanding Contributions to the Next Generation of Knowledge Management Systems,Communication and Organizational Knowledge: Issues for Theory and Practice,"Work teams are increasingly geographically dispersed, have dynamic memberships, and cross organizational boundaries. In order to manage customers, interorganizational relationships, and organizational knowledge, organizations are increasingly turning to knowledge repositories, or technology and documentation systems that connect people to information. This paper explores the communal and connective knowledge repositories currently used in the workplace, including document storage, customer relationship management, best practices, and collaboration systems. Each of these systems has different levels of connectivity and communality. This paper theorizes about the various networks that motivate and inhibit contributions to the new generation of knowledge repositories, including physical networks, infrastructure networks, affinity networks, and representational networks. As such, the paper suggests that level of contribution to knowledge repositories is influenced by the nature of the system, the usefulness of the system, the physical dispersion of participants, the social relationships among participants, and the ability for participants to reap symbolic rewards."

This paper offers a theoretical model of news slant, differentiates slant from bias, and illustrates the model with a content analysis of mainstream news coverage during the 2008 US presidential campaign. Bias is defined as patterns of slant that persist across time, message dimensions, and media outlets. Data come from ABC and NBC evening news and Sunday morning news discussion shows, from USA Today, and from Time and Newsweek. Depending on the period, on which politically relevant message components one examines, and on outlet, we find news slanted strongly against Obama and Democrats, and news slanted heavily against McCain and Republicans. For instance, despite many claims to the contrary, McCain and Palin enjoyed vastly more supportive coverage than Obama and Biden on many dimensions during the weeks of the two party conventions from sampled media. But different findings emerge from other periods and dimensions of campaign news. The paper concludes by assessing implications of these data for developing a sophisticated theory of the ways news slant and perhaps bias distribute political power, with specific attention to the history-making racial politics of 2008."
2009-1795,"Understanding media in transitional societies: Beyond naive ""democratization theory""",Political Communication in Transitional Democracies - A Global Perspective,,,,Paper,"Understanding media in transitional societies: Beyond naive ""democratization theory""",Political Communication in Transitional Democracies - A Global Perspective,"The dominant discourses about the major changes experienced by dictatorial regimes in the last quarter of the last century stress a process of development towards democracy, closely linked with the establishment of a free market. There are two major problems with this view. The first is theoretical: these are teleological views of historical development that assume that we are observing, and can perhaps accelerate, a predestined progress towards a known end-state. The second problem is empirical: the evidence does not support such views. There certainly are cases of more or less successful democratization. There are, however, cases in which it is difficult to speak of democratization, and others in which a greater or lesser degree of democratization appears to have been rolled back in recent years. On the other hand, there appears to be little evidence for any correlation between marketization and democratization. All of this suggests that a new and more robust way of theorizing these developments is urgently required. This paper examines the evolution of the mass media in five cases (Poland, Russia, China, South Africa and Brazil) in order to try to develop such a new theory of the nature of contemporary social change."

How might the boundaries of race, ethnicity and culture break down as people move through time and space, continuously making and remaking their worlds? What triggers revised thinking? This study is an attempt to capture the process by which one overcomes or manages a previously held stereotype about the other."

Primetime schedules from 147 PBS member stations from September 2005 were compared with the PBS national feed to determine a coefficient of scheduling power. Significant power coefficients ranged from 0.063 to 1.0. Stations licensed to local educational were the only group to have significantly different power coefficients. Follow-up interviews with selected station programmers suggest several themes work to shape power at member stations, most notably, localism. Future research should consider station size, budget and location."

It also examines the relationship of media images to local news media use and comprehension. Analyses of a national survey data (n = 505) show that reading of local newspapers was positively associated with age, gender, and income, whereas reading of editorials or letters to the editor was explained by age, gender, ethnicity, and households with children younger than 18. The image of perceived good local newspaper was significantly associated with both use of local newspapers and readership of editorial journalism after controlling for demographic variables in small communities."

The University delivers education both in face-to-face workshops and via distance education in which students are supplied with study materials. Current discourses talk of converging these two modes of delivery. This means reducing the amount of face-to-face teaching/learning and increasing the amount of learning/teaching interaction that takes place online. The intent of the study is to inform the design of an online environment to support converged delivery.

The study employed survey methodology to test whether or not the use or reliance on mass media for information about another group was related to stereotypical perceptions of that group. The questionnaire was distributed to 400 college students in the U.S. and China. The survey measured three variables: stereotypes, media consumption, and media reliance. The main findings from this study include: 1) the use of American news media is related to perceptions of China as a competitor and threat to America; and 2) watching Hollywood movies is related to more positive perceptions of Americans. Finally, the implications and limitations are discussed and suggestions for future research are offered."

However, theoretical development in this area has largely lagged behind. Conceptualizing telework as constituted by communication practices enabled by information and communication technologies (ICTs) and drawing upon a broader dialectical framework, this study intends to develop the basis for a dialectical model of telework practice. By examining telework practices and experiences through qualitative methods in a large international accounting firm, the study identifies the primary and secondary dialectical tensions and communication strategies for managing tensions. Our findings contribute to the literature of telework with a heuristic conceptual model that accommodates existing ""contradictory"" empirical findings about telework. The study reveals communication strategies, such as presence management, and opens up new avenues for future research. Practically, the findings will benefit organizations in designing better telework policies and training practices."

The model is applied to study intention to use the functions of phone, organizer, camera and MP3 player in personal digital assistants (PDA). A survey with more than 200 respondents shows how the antecedents varied among functions. In particular, pleasure shows much stronger effects for high-hedonic functions than low-hedonic functions. In addition, although the percentages of variances explained in intention to use high-hedonic functions are higher than those in low-hedonic functions, high-hedonic functions may not necessarily have higher percentages of variances explained in the overall device. The findings contribute to both research and practice."

We employed a social network approach to theorize and empirically test the structures, antecedents, and outcomes of intra-organizational information retrieval and allocation. Data were collected from 110 individuals across 9 work teams, and analyzed using Exponential Random Graph Modeling (ERGM) technique. The results found a multiplexity and reciprocity of team members information retrieval and allocation. Furthermore, there was a predominant centralized structure of information retrieval. Members information allocation was driven by their motivations for knowledge sharing, and they tended to engage in information retrieval and allocation across job positions. Finally, members were more satisfied with their team work when proactively retrieving information from others than when receiving unsolicited information allocated from others. This study has important theoretical and practical implications for understanding and managing organizational knowledge and learning networks."
2009-1805,"Understand Users, Then Ignore Them: The Construction of the User Within Web Design Texts","Uses, Users & Usability",,,,Paper,"Understand Users, Then Ignore Them: The Construction of the User Within Web Design Texts","Uses, Users & Usability","This paper considers the problematic relationship between new media designers and users in texts written about user-centered design. Historically, users have been viewed as potential error-makers whose unpredictable behaviors cause problems for systems engineers. However, user-centered design approaches found within the fields of interaction design and information architecture place the user at the center of the technological system. To better understand and solidify the importance of the user within the technological artifact, these designers often create what are called personas  prototypical users with names, faces, interests, and preferences. Personas serve as boundary objects (Bowker & Star, 1999), used as conceptual stand-ins for users when making design decisions. Drawing on theoretical approaches from science and technology studies (STS) and cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), I examined current texts written about user-centered design, information architecture, and interaction design to understand the ways in which users are discursively written into the design process. My analysis suggests that personas serve as a kind of simulacra (Baudrillard, 1995), and their use is as much motivated by political realities within new media organizations, as it is by the need to incorporate user needs within the design process. In addition, I argue that personas serve to reinscribe the conceptual separation between the user and designer despite technological developments (like Web 2.0) that blur this boundary."
2009-1806,United Kingdom: A Public Service Publisher on the Internet?,Public Service Media: Protecting the Public Interest in the Digital Environment,,,,Paper,United Kingdom: A Public Service Publisher on the Internet?,Public Service Media: Protecting the Public Interest in the Digital Environment,"The presentation examines the policy debate over the suggestion made in 2004 by the UK communications regulator Ofcom, in the course of its first review of public service broadcasting, that some public service content might in future be funded by establishing a public service publisher alongside existing public service institutions. The proposal sparked a fierce reaction and Ofcom appears to have toned down its interest in such a model. However, digital convergence requires interventionist support to ensure the continued fulfillment of certain important public service journalistic functions across a range of electronic delivery systems. While established public service communications (no longer simply broadcasting) institutions will continue to play a crucial role in the digital era, there is also a need to explore new ways of conceiving developing and funding public service journalism."

A series of multilevel analyses examining cultural level (U.S. and China) and individual level differences in the evaluation of three communication skills and two preferred forms of social support were conducted across two separate samples.
Results indicated that the theoretical links between culture, self, and communication specified by the universal needs theory found more consistent support across both studies. In addition, the results found here suggest that cultural difference in selfways and behavior exist against a background of important cultural similarities. Specifically, communication styles appear to be linked primarily to universal dimensions in selfways. Selfways in turn, are emphasized to different degrees within different cultural groups. Thus, establishing the links between selfways and communication styles appears to predict cultural preferences as well."

This study tests the degree to which unwillingness to communicate in face-to-face interactions impacts motives for Facebook use within the theoretical framework of the uses and gratifications theory. A survey of 172 students enrolled in a large American research university was conducted to test the hypotheses that people who are unwilling to communicate offline would go to Facebook to pass time or to be less lonely. Results of structural equation modeling showed partial support for our predictions.
2009-1809,Urban Communication and the Transformation of the Urban Landscape,Keyword: Urban Communication,,,,Paper,Urban Communication and the Transformation of the Urban Landscape,Keyword: Urban Communication,"Vital social life once offered by an urban environment, one replete with busy streets, markets, parks, promenades, and squares, was long a defining characteristic of town and city culture. In 1964, Melvin N. Webber described the transformation of community from propinquitous to non-propinquitous, from a place to a non-place orientation. More recently, in Tenacious Cities Webber said, metropolis is a massive communications switchboard . . . It exists because interdependent persons and groups have to be accessible to each other and because the cost of overcoming space has not yet reached zero (Webber, 1996). As we approach the point at which such connection is zero, the impact on the urban/ suburban /landscape is being examined through lenses of the communication discipline. This paper explores the transformation of the urban landscape and resilient city as a communication network."

Findings From a Multinational Study on Leading Online Newspapers UGC Practices,,,,Paper,User-Generated Content as a Challenge to Traditional Journalistic Ideology,The Decline of the Gatekeeper? Findings From a Multinational Study on Leading Online Newspapers UGC Practices,"Journalism is not only a profession and the central institution enabling public communication but also a system of convictions and beliefs that shape and structure the construction of its specific social reality  in short, an ideology. The interviews from our multi-national study reveal that the current debate about UGC in online journalism can be understood in terms of a clash of two prevailing inclinations and their underlying ideologies. One could be called segregational inclination. It emphasizes the need to maintain clear borderlines between professional media content and UGC while admitting that the ultimate goal of journalism is to serve the public. This reflects traditional journalistic ideology, which conceptualizes journalism as professionalized top-down communication from trained journalists working in organizations to a more or less mute audience. The other inclination could be called integrational, which accepts that journalistic content can be a genuine composite of professionals and users input.
Elaboration of these two inclinations will be done by comparing the development in various countries, as in former comparative studies, but also by comparing the organizations and individual journalists on the basis of the interview material. By doing so, the two inclinations and their underlying ideologies become more transparent  and so do factors influencing their development on a macro (system), meso (organization) and micro level (actor)."
2009-1811,User-Generated Video and Intertextuality,Television Studies 2009: Contemporary Perspectives on a Changing Medium,,,,Paper,User-Generated Video and Intertextuality,Television Studies 2009: Contemporary Perspectives on a Changing Medium,"This paper discusses the changing relationship between texts, producers and audiences and tries to understand user-generated audio-visual content or to be more precise, intertextuality in user-generated videos in relation to distribution formats, cultural form and genres.
Emphasising that Intertextuality is a keyword in communication, we continue on from the work of John Fiske and the notion of vertical and horizontal intertextuality. The paper tries to develop Fiskes original ideas so that his model incorporates the changing relationship between producers and their audiences, the text generated by mainstream media and the text generated by ordinary people, in particular user-generated videos uploaded and shared in social media networks online.
Finally we are informed by Paul Ricoeurs work on hermeneutics and self as another and explore the role of user-generated content as a specific kind of mediated sociability we suggest that user-generated content may be seen as a collaborative effort to navigate the meaning of life. Hence we address questions of mediated sociability, offering a critical perspective on textual self-expression and self-identity."

Social videogames that engage players from around the world are rapidly expanding as new social media and an advertising platform for corporations. Using theories of symbolic interactionism and self-presentation, meanings were sought related to influences of player identity, social roles, world structure and social interaction. Data from six players in the U.S. and Asia was gathered and analyzed using the long-interview method. Initial findings suggest brands and objects tie to status and achievement, through an interpretive process of social interaction among players and with world structure. This process also manifests in online and offline connections to identity, reflecting brands and objects in and outside of the game. Implications are discussed for players and immersive brand experiences as a starting point for further study."

In a mixed-design experiment among 216 children (aged 4 to 6 years), we investigated how childrens snack liking and preference varied by (a) the type of snack (healthy banana versus unhealthy banana sweets) and (b) type of character on package (familiar versus unfamiliar versus no character). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that although the banana with a character was never more appealing than the sweets, it was more appealing than the banana without a character. In addition, the banana with a character was just as likable as the sweets, regardless of the type of character."
2009-1814,Using Computer and Television at the Same Time: Different Forms of Multitasking?,Multitasking in Daily Media Use: Theoretical Approaches and Empirical Explorations,,,,Paper,Using Computer and Television at the Same Time: Different Forms of Multitasking?,Multitasking in Daily Media Use: Theoretical Approaches and Empirical Explorations,"In recent years television has become more and more a background medium. Watching television and carrying out other activities at the same time is a situation where multitasking skills are always needed to some extent. But it has to be taken into account that these situations are of different complexity: In the total population, eating and doing housework' are the most frequent simultaneous activities (Kuhlmann & Wolling, 2004, p. 397). These activities are characterised by low cognitive demands where multitasking is relatively easy to handle.
In contrast, a student survey conducted in Germany in January 2008 (652 respondents) shows that in this group the simultaneous use of TV and PC has become the standard mode of media use (Kuhlmann, 2008; Beentjes, Koolstra & van der Voort, 1996; Pool, Koolstra & van der Voort, 2003). The use of each single of these two media requires a high (yet varying) degree of cognitive capacities. Therefore, the question comes up as to how recipients could manage this much more demanding and complex multitasking situation.
The presentation will particularly deal with:
 The spatial constellation of PC and TV: Surprisingly we find any angle of the TV´s position in relation to the PC in nearly the same frequency.
 The contents of parallel use: On the one hand we find expectable differences between the various spatial constellations: If the TV set is in the back and the screen out of the field of vision, music channels are preferred as background program. With the TV set in front, information programs and films are preferred. On the other hand we see interesting correlations between the type of PC applications used and the preferred television content: PC workers prefer humoristic programmes on TV, whereas gamers show a preference for thrilling movies. Even the extreme mode of multitasking (working at the PC and following information programs on TV) can be observed frequently, at least among students.

Im interested in the human capacity to bring attention to the action/movement/prompting of spirit. If one had a practice of considering communicating, verbing, broadly defined, as an invention for coordinating gap bridging with other individual humans, then one might release the hold on the habitual communicative procedurings that are no longer useful in coordinating actions with others. A benefit of attending to the spiritual is its potent availability and location in the present moment, the present situation, such that it is resource for suggesting and enacting nuanced and responsive ways of bridging the gaps of individual and collective human sense-making and step-taking in the present moment."

Previous work has shown that the primary mechanisms for collaboration amongst these networks are email listservs (Cogburn, 2005). Email archives yield large amounts of rich textual data. However, they are frequently difficult to exploit fully through traditional hand coded approaches, which are helped only slightly by the use of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) applications. Text mining and keyword analysis may potentially unlock these invaluable data. This paper uses content analysis and text mining to ask, what is the impact of cultural context on decision-making processes in transnational civil society networks? Halls (1976) theory of high vs. low context cultural dimensions informs our conceptual model of distributed decision-making. We test this model with data from a four-year public email archive of the transnational civil society involved in UN World Summit on the Information Society."

This model-building piece responds to several calls found in the organizational and groups literature to develop a framework to guide research on contemporary ICT use in meetings. Our model relies on the perspective of adaptive structuration theory (AST; Poole & DeSanctis, 1990) and highlights the importance of considering multiple levels of analysis and influence on organizational meetings. We first provide a justification for how contemporary, often portable, ICTs are changing the pace of meeting communication and access to information. To elaborate our meso-level model, we showcase three dilemmashigh-tech/low-tech, personal/work, and participationthat help illustrate the importance of considering multiple levels to understand meeting practices. From the model we derive twelve testable propositions that should help guide future meetings research."

Based on an analysis of the past U.S. public diplomacy practices, the paper finds that these efforts were mainly characterized by a one-way flow of information and an emphasis on image management. Using the theories of hegemony, American exceptionalism, Orientalism, and cultural imperialism, the paper lays a theoretical framework for analyzing public diplomacy. The paper suggests that for public diplomacy to move beyond propaganda, it needs to incorporate two-way communication and symmetry. This is while scholars have criticized current U.S. public diplomacy practices for perpetuating the Cold War styles of communication which were mainly one-way. Furthermore, public diplomacy to date has not been used as an instrument for building symmetrical relationships with foreign publics. Based on the excellence theory in public relations, symmetry means that both parties (i.e. the United States government and its publics) should be open to change if such change furthers the mutual interest of all parties. Thus, in addition to symbolic relationships (as in mediated messages), public diplomacy should concern actual behavioral relationships. Not only should communication of messages involve dialogue, but also the consequences of such messaging should take into account the views of other parties."

The internet has unique capabilities for supplying health information, including the use of targeting specific populations and employing specific evidence strategies to create more effective messages.
Objective: This research sought to address the presence of information targeting low literacy, racially diverse, non-English speaking, and age diverse audiences. In addition, this study documented the utilization of evidence strategies for these four audiences. Specifically, the likelihood that those websites which target one of these four audiences are to make use of statistical or storytelling evidence was compared to websites that do not target one of these four audiences.
Method: This research examined these relationships on 157 breast cancer websites through content analysis.
Results: Nearly half of the websites did not target the groups of interest here. Websites with multiple languages were found to be more likely to use statistical evidence and websites with low literacy sections were found to be less likely to do so, as compared to websites that did not target these groups. Websites with ethnic or racial diversity and age diversity sections were more likely to use first person storytelling about breast cancer, as compared to websites that did not target these groups.
Conclusions: Current breast cancer websites demonstrate promising use of targeting specific audiences and employing evidence strategies prescribed as effective by past research. Future research examining these issues will benefit with direct input from website users."

People suffering with asthma miss 11.8 million days of work and 14 million days of school annually. Asthma is also the third highest cause of hospitalization and many of the patients are seen at the emergency department. The annual cost of asthma is estimated at $18 billion. While there is currently no cure for asthma, management of the disease can effectively control it. Mobile phones can serve as a potential platform to facilitate the management of asthma. The objective of this study is to employ principles from social cognitive theory to test the feasibility and utilization of tracking asthma symptoms through a mobile phone application. This research also seeks to understand if managing asthma through mobile phones can also improve health literacy of asthma patients, by helping them better understand their chronic condition and provide better communication opportunities with their primary care physician regarding their asthma. If the data shows improvement in subjects asthma self-efficacy and satisfaction of tracking asthma in this manner, a future study with controls will be conducted to determine changes in health outcomes and improved health literacy."

Second, its focus is on the role of television news use in relation to the traditional predictors of elaboration in the model, surveillance gratifications and attention. Using thought-listing, the study taps viewers thoughts while they are watching a news bulletin. Analysis of verbal protocols focused on two dimensions of complexity: Differentiation and integration. Findings suggest that in addition to motivation, television news use predicts differentiated, but not integrated thinking. This may account for the low levels of recall and understanding found in previous research. Furthermore, the study may be seen as a further validation of the cognitive mediation model, while also developing it both through adding a new factor to the model and by providing a way to directly and reliably tap elaboration."

While definitions from the Feminist Dictionary were preferred and considered to more closely reflect the respondents actual experiences as often as the Oxford definitions, for some words, women were significantly more likely than men to select the Feminist Dictionary definitions. The results provide moderate support for the continued viability and relevance of the muted group theorys tenet that females will be more dissatisfied with the dominant modes of public expressionin this case, traditional dictionary definitions."

Dervins Sense-Making Methodology offers not only a framework to explore the political dimensions of communication broadly construed, but to interrogate the value-free methods of this sub-field that perpetuate existing power dynamics."
2009-1824,Video Use Moderates Skin Conductance Responses to Video Clips Labeled Real People vs. Actors,Keywords in Information Systems: Framing (High Density),,,,Paper,Video Use Moderates Skin Conductance Responses to Video Clips Labeled Real People vs. Actors,Keywords in Information Systems: Framing (High Density),"Abstract
This study replicates a study (Reeves & Vega, 2006) showing that labeling video clips showing equivalent social content as Real People versus Actors increase physiological arousal, as indicated by skin conductance levels. This study further demonstrates that individual differences in video use can moderate the perceived realism effect. Heavy video media users showed lower levels of physiological arousal in response to highly arousing video content, indicating desensitization. Both heavy and light video media users showed relative skin conductance increases in response to labels of Real People versus Actors. However, heavy versus light video users differed in terms of the type of video content that elicited the perceived realism effect. Highly arousing content (e.g., segments with sexual or violent themes) labeled as Real People increased physiological arousal for heavy video users but not for light video users, possibly due to a ceiling effect. Low arousal content labeled Real People increased physiological arousal for light video users, but not for heavy video users."
2009-1825,"Viewer Responses to Character Race and Social Status in Advertising: Blacks See Color, Whites See Class",Meanings of Difference and Identity Construction in Media Consumption,,,,Paper,"Viewer Responses to Character Race and Social Status in Advertising: Blacks See Color, Whites See Class",Meanings of Difference and Identity Construction in Media Consumption,"Content analyses of minority appearances in advertising have suggested that racial minorities not only need to be more numerically represented, but more appropriately portrayed in a variety of social class contexts. While much research has explored the impact of character race on viewer response to ads, little empirical work has been done to understand the impact of character portrayal through social status on viewers identification with advertising characters. This paper focuses on how the social class portrayal of Black and White characters influences advertisement evaluations and identification with advertising characters. Character race and social status is digitally manipulated in print ads to examine differences in viewer response. Results indicate that Black participants use race as the primary cue in evaluating a character, while White participants use social class as the primary cue. Implications for advertisers and the social impact of social class portrayals are discussed."
2009-1826,Violence Against Women in the Black Press: The Case of Juanita Bynum,Challenging Gender and Race Barriers in the Media,,,,Paper,Violence Against Women in the Black Press: The Case of Juanita Bynum,Challenging Gender and Race Barriers in the Media,"This study examines how the Black press covered an instance of violence within the African American faith community. It provides a critical discourse analysis of coverage in five African American newspapers of the Aug. 22, 2007 attack on televangelist Juanita Bynum by her husband, the Rev. Thomas Weeks III. The Black press largely ignored the assault itself and used it as a heuristic device to talk about violence against women more generally and within co-pastoral marriages more specifically, drawing on church leaders to explain the causes of and solutions for domestic violence. These leaders failed to hold Weeks accountable for the violence and, at times, represented Bynum as equally to blame. In adhering to its historic role of providing positive portrayals of African Americans to inspire and uplift the Black community, the Black press failed African American women who are the victims of domestic violence."

A major objective of this study is to examine some of the potential differences between academic and industry based conceptualizations of viral marketing. The benefit of understanding the actual practices and processes of those in industry who regularly design and implement viral campaigns cannot be overstated. Using a theoretical framework comprising Rogers (1983) Diffusion of Innovations and Dimmicks (2003) Theory of the Niche, the results of the study indicate that in the advertising industry viral marketing is not always regarded as a defining strategy, but as criteria inherent in many marketing communications. Therefore, viral marketing may not necessarily be considered a stand alone type of marketing concept. Additional findings indicate that opinion leadership is a very important component of a viral marketing campaign. Other findings and theoretical implications are discussed."

Immersive virtual environment technology (IVET) was used to create photorealistic virtual representations of the self that were depicted eating healthy and unhealthy food in a virtual world. Two aspects of this world (first vs. third perspective and a changing vs. unchanging body) were manipulated to determine their effects on presence in the environment. Based on previous research, presence was hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these characteristics and the behavioral outcome of imitating the avatars eating behavior. Results indicated that presence did indeed mediate this relationship, but that the effects varied for men and women in accordance with previous research on sex differences in eating behavior. Men who experienced high presence were more likely than low presence men to imitate the virtual model and eat candy, whereas women who experienced high presence were more likely than low presence women to suppress the behavior and not eat candy."

Experiment 1 tested if men and women would linguistically assimilate a virtual gender identity intimated by randomly assigned gendered avatars (either matched or mismatched to their true gender). Results supported the notion that gender-matched avatars increase the likelihood of gender-typical language use, whereas gender-mismatched avatars tended to promote counter-typical language, especially among women. The gender of a partners avatar, however, did not influence participants language. Experiment 2 focused on gender-mismatched avatars only and found that the degree of linguistic assimilation to a virtual gender identity varied as a function of the topic, such that both men and women used less tentative language when their avatars gender was consistent with the topics gender (e.g., male avatar-masculine topic). In addition, women made more emotional references and apologies to partners with female than male avatars when the topic was masculine. Results generally comport with a gender salience explanation and self-categorization theory."

Next, virtual organizations and their use of communication technologies will be discussed. Finally, a set of propositions will be formulated, suggesting that generalist organizations could solve the traditional problems of collaboration, customization, and anti-mass production sentiment through the successful use of virtual technologies. If generalist virtual organizations are successful in their efforts to collaborate, customize, and circumvent the anti-mass production sentiment, they should be able to fuse generalist and specialist capabilities in a highly productive way and move into the specialist dominated periphery of the market niche. Such success, in turn, could lead to higher market share for the generalist virtual organization and therefore cause higher mortality rates for the specialist forms in that niche."

Four major themes and nine sub-themes were discovered that characterized the examined international students acculturation life: 1) Making comparisons of US and China 2) Feeling and being treated as an outsider 3) Life in transition and the repositioning of the self 4) Coping strategies. Findings were interpreted in view of the extant literature on international students and intercultural communication. Suggestions for future research were proposed."

This pilot study suggests that though people generally make assumptions about the user of the avatar based on similar visual characteristicsthey do indeed make distinctions between the twooccasionally even disparate distinctions. Our findings indicate that the sex of the avatar does not have an affect on the credibility of the user. Male avatars, though possibly less attractive according to the literature, were rated just as credible as the female avatars. Instead, the avatars visual artifacts, and their visually conservative nature as indicated by the culture, had the greatest affect on participants view of user credibility."

To the contrary, the written and spoken words of candidates, pundits, and journalists provide the impetus for most political communication research. Doris Graber has referred to this scholarly sensibility as the Gutenberg tradition that rests on assumptions that the printed word is the preeminent supplier of information that facilitates participatory civic engagement. Candidate images therefore remains largely understudied as a source of information and influence in election outcomes. Breaking with the time honored Gutenberg tradition, data will be presented to reveal carefully crafted visual frames that image handlers construct for their clients and how their prominence in media outlets interact with public support for candidates."

Concentrating upon movies such as 100 Days (2001) Hotel Rwanda (2004), Shooting Dogs (2005), and Sometimes in April (2005), the paper argues that these films give voice to the traumatic experiences, the act of suffering and of looking back. Besides questions on the portrayal of victims and aggressors, and the presentation of themes such as guilt and responsibility, this paper stresses the issue of how these movies try to visualize and recreate traumatic experiences and collective memory. The paper is inspired by recent theories on trauma and visual culture, by Deleuze's approach to time and cinema, and the wide cinema/Holocaust literature."

Following a review of the current state of the art in visual campaign research and an assessment of its strengths and weaknesses, it turns to the Internet as the medium of choice for 21st-century political advertising. It singles out the spot as the most popular form of political communication and selects four genre-specific ads from Hillary Clintons, Barack Obamas, and John McCains primary campaigns. Visual content analysis and iconography are applied in order to identify stylistic and strategic features that make a particular candidate stand out or, conversely, that render two or all three contenders similar in terms of visual style and visual strategies."

For the photographer confronted with the challenge of bearing witness to conflict on our behalf, the effort to record its human consequences raises important issues of interpretation. This paper seeks to show how familiar assumptions about photojournalisms capacity to represent violence in an impartial manner are being decisively recast by the digital revolution in photographic technologies. In examining our camera-mediated knowledge of war, to use Susan Sontags phrase, it explores a number of questions confronting the photojournalist  both professional and amateur alike  committed to making real the horrors of human suffering. Evidence is drawn from several case studies of images taken in the Iraq war in order to assess the implications of digitalization for the future of photojournalism in wartime, with particular attention devoted to photojournalisms moral responsibilities where visual truth-telling is concerned."

This study examines how schemas function in math and science learning, and in vocational anticipatory socialization (VAS) to explain how students develop interests in math- and science-related careers by guiding their interpretation of the personal relevance of concepts (McVee, Dunsmore & Gavelek, 2005). I explore communication factors involved in provoking and maintaining student interest in pursuing STEM careers. Findings suggest that adolescents want to know whether and how math and science concepts and classes will be useful to them in the future (e.g. in a career). However, absent in classroom lessons are the connections of math and science subjects to related career paths, a potential contributor to developing STEM career interest."

As a result, we face a crucial shortage of workers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas. Through vocational anticipatory socialization (VAS) adolescents develop interest in various vocations and, in general, learn about the world of work (Jablin 1987; 2001). In this research, we investigate academic and related career interests arguing that by the time students are in high school, a large number have already chosen not to pursue math or science, effectively eliminating their chances of entering STEM-based careers. Qualitative data from 38 adolescent focus groups (241 students) point to factors influencing their interest in math and science subjects and related careers. The resulting model depicts gender, cultural/socioeconomic, experiential, and personal factors (self-efficacy, exposure, resilience), and importantly, the sources and significance of VAS messages, toward the development of academic-career pursuits."

Yet how new is this new media gossip? This project examines the celebrity gossip blog within the history of American-based celebrity gossip media. I compare the rhetorical styles of gossip columnists Walter Winchell and Louella Parsons, the original print-based gossip columnists, to that of the contemporary celebrity gossip blogger, particularly Perez Hilton. I argue that celebrity gossip blogs represent a resurgence of the commentary-laden style typical of the earlier columnists that underscores the notion that celebrities are made meaningful for audiences by and through gossip. While the technology of the Internet does have an impact on the ways media audiences consume and engage with celebrity, this project traces the historical role of text-based gossip in shaping the ideological force of celebrity images.

Questions posed include in what ways are soldiers versions of the war being distributed and how are those accounts similar to and different from traditional reporting of war? I focus here on three categories of soldiers accounts of war: 1) Individuals soldiers, who independently create content documenting their war experiences, generally posted to sites such as YouTube, Flickr or Blogger; 2) Corporate aggregators & filters which also provide real voices from soldiers but collect them within commercial contexts (such as the History Channels Band of Bloggers or Milblogging.com, a corporate membership organization owned by Monster; and 3) Soldier shapers (to adapt Solelys [1992] term), primarily the Pentagon, which seek to influence and manipulate soldier and pro-war content within social media. Together, this solider content sphere exemplifies the de-professionalization of war coverage as well as the fragmentation of war news into niches.

2009-1843,"Was ""Taste"" Passive for Addison?",Communication History Poster Session,,,,Paper,"Was ""Taste"" Passive for Addison?",Communication History Poster Session,"In ""Keywords,"" Raymond Williams endorses Wordsworth's critique of the concept of ""Taste"" as a passive faculty. Wordsworth's achievement is to ""reanimate taste as a metaphor."" The ""metaphorical transfer"" that ""was the abstraction of a human faculty to a polite attribute, emphasized by the capital letter and significantly associated, as in the Addison example, with the notion of Rules, and elsewhere with Manners."" Williams here implicitly connects Joseph Addison, primary author of the famed 18C periodical the Spectator, with a passive conception of Taste and spectatorship that is implicitly bound up with contemporary consumer culture.

This paper considers Addison's concept of Taste from this perspective. Although Addison's concept of Taste is exclusionary (in a implicit, not an explicit fashion), it is not passive. In in fact is a prerequisite for entering into a community of opinion that requires an open rather than a passive engagement with critique and assessment."

We explored the possibility that television exposure may not only be directly related to perceptions of risk, but also indirectly trough fear. 923 randomly selected respondents completed a Health and Media Interview Survey. Structural Equation Modeling confirmed that fear was an intervening variable between television news exposure and risk perception about health problems. Watching health content on television news was also directly related to risk perception, but this was only true for rarely experienced health problems. While risk estimates were not related to intended health behavior, both fear of health problems and news exposure directly predicted respondents intentions to engage in positive health actions."

How an individual frames one self with respect to and in conjunction with ones interpersonal relationships and material and communicative structures shapes ones identity. This in turn shapes how one enacts the self given the relationships and available contexts one is embedded in, all of which have a significant influence on how one communicates about and negotiates health and illness. This article examines how members of a community of sex workers in Kalighat, in the city of Kolkata in India communicatively construct their selves with respect to their prevalent cultural indices and available structures, and how enunciations and enactments of sex worker selves as mothers first influence localized patterns of HIV/AIDS communication and related work practices. Sex worker narratives suggest that mainstream assumptions and identity labels that depict sex workers as incapable mothers and the concurrent HIV/AIDS practices imposed on them need to be questioned and transformed in order to effect positive changes in health and HIV/AIDS negotiation practices among members of this marginalized community."

Findings From a Multinational Study on Leading Online Newspapers UGC Practices,,,,Paper,Weaving the Thread: Gatekeeping and Filtering Strategies for User Comments,The Decline of the Gatekeeper? Findings From a Multinational Study on Leading Online Newspapers UGC Practices,"User comments have become the most popular form of user-generated content, comprising the updated, hybrid ""look"" of online news  journalists' output accompanied by a thread of user responses. Unlike traditional channels for voicing popular opinion, such as letters to the editor or studio call-ins, user responses are highly accessible, inviting impulsive, snap authorship. Though journalists themselves helped build the soaring popularity of readers' comments, in many of the studied newsrooms, they criticize the outcome as superficial and offensive. The studied newsrooms have adopted different gatekeeping strategies in order to control user comments, ranging from inclusive policies, which invite virtually everyone to comment on everything, to more exclusive policies, which require identification and prior registration. Filtering strategies range from post-publication dismissal, following users' alerts about ""unsuitable content,"" to prior publication selection. The latter is carried out either by outsourcing the filtering role to a third party outside the newsroom or by doing it in-house using administrative or journalistic staffs. A minority of journalists reads comments routinely, searching for story ideas, follow-ups and corrections; most of them disregard their potential contribution. However, even these journalists like to see a volume of comments under their stories -- unless they contain personal criticism of the reporters or their published items. These arrangements and attitudes may shape not only the final volume of published comments but also their quality, tone, and capacity to serve as a leading channel of contemporary vox populi."

Drawing from focus group interviews among recent Chinese Protestant immigrants in Toronto, we argue that new media use is broadened by users cultural appropriation in situational contexts to include proxy Internet access as accommodative communication given the political and legal constraints in their home country. Chinese transmigrants not only re-interpret and alter semantic associations that spiritualize the Internet, they also engage in innovative strategies that involve the intertwining of offline and online communicative modes. These include deploying complementary media forms or communicating in codes that are mutually understood among participating members to facilitate intragroup networking among Chinese religious communities. Implications are discussed with regard to the importance of cultural norms and situational context in shaping mediated international communication."

This study found that usefulness of information and dialogic loop are the most frequently appeared dialogic principles on the Web sites. This also found that their is no relationship between the host countrys trade ranking with the United States and the number of dialogic features found on U.S. embassy sites also no correlation between the views of the U.S. of the people in the host country and the number of dialogic features found on U.S. embassy sites.

From a sample of 103 U.S. Fortune 500 corporate websites this research examines how corporations individually and collectively describe CSR. The results of this study suggest that CSR communication invokes four dimensions: people, places, practices, and purposes. At the organizational level, CSR is understood in relation to organizational employees, the communities in which the organization does business, specific business operations, and guiding organizational principles. At the institutional level, CSR embraces strategic ambiguity and describes the role of the corporate form, writ large, in society."

Utilizing a critical-cultural lens, this presentation takes up (through textual analysis, framing theory, and a political economy perspective) how these shows are positioned 1) historically with regard to the development of the charity telethon format, 2) as contemporary articulations related to mobilizing political knowledge and behavior macrosocially and 3) as developments in international communication with regard to fostering global relations. From this analysis, I argue that these shows primarily operate as a means to distort how American audiences perceive the problem of global poverty, conceptualize solutions to it, and ultimately understand their role in and relationship to the notion of global crises more generally."

This study investigates information seeking in two distinct phases surrounding orientation  the preentry period of anticipatory socialization and organizational entry. Data from 143 new employees were used to explore the effects of orientation on channels used to seek information. Results indicate that new employees say they will use the handbook, face-to-face communication, and email significantly more after orientation than before. The study also classifies newcomers uncertainty during preentry into 10 different types of benefits-related questions. Social costs of newcomers in the preentry phase do not influence information seeking, a divergent finding from previous research in other phases of socialization."

Chelsea Handler has incorporated political comment both strident and pithy into that seeming safe-haven for celebrity news, E!, creating a site for savvy, not just snarky, talk that quickly veers from Britney Spears to John McCain and back again. In fact, Handler has embraced her position on the talkshow margins as a pulpit, openly endorsing Obama and brutally rebuffing wealthy Americans who dont want to pay a greater share of taxes. At a time when TV shows are chopped into pieces for online distribution, when there is a baby-boom of mashup video artists, and video posts spread online like wildfire, it is time to consider the production, distribution, and exhibition not just of satire programs, but satiric moments.

Racial and Economic Citizenships in the Caribbean,Representation and Rejection: Rearticulating Fear Through Brown,"This paper explores the challenges Caribbean citizens and governments face in trying to pursue both democracy and economic sustainability at this time. One way in which these challenges manifest themselves is in the overt and covert debates about who has a right to claim the protection of state institutions. In this paper I explore the ways in which brown is used to mark out the responsibilities that political representatives have towards their constituencies. The paper examines who has a right to claim the protection of state institutions. Within these debates brown surfaces as a way of drawing a line between those claims which are deemed legitimate and those which are deemed illegitimate.

Using Dervins Sense-Making Methodology to explore the image retrieval needs of healthcare professionals,Addressing communication's keywords communicatively: Multi-context exemplars and interrogations of the uses of Dervin's Sense-Making Methodology,The main goal of this study is to explore the information behavior of information professionals to inform the design of alternative user interfaces that can use multifaceted and multimedia questions for retrieving medical images. The study will use Dervins Sense-Making Methodology to explore and understand the information-seeking behaviors of medical students and healthcare professionals. Results will be used to inform the design and implementation of a user interface to support user queries that contain text and image features.

In-depth interviews were conducted seeking the views of 20 public relations practitioners, from five global public relations firms in Korea, of their job roles. The results of this study showed that three roles for practitioners who work in global public relations firms were rediscovered: business manager, strategic counselor/manager, and non-strategic technician. It also identified nine factors affecting public relations practitioners roles. The important and powerful factors, contributing to practitioners perceptions of job roles, were chiefly attributed to culturally oriented influences. Finally, it provides critical clues to the process of enhancing public relations professionalism."
2009-1856,What if You Satirized an Election and Nobody Watched?: Tina Fey and Sarah Palin Steal the Spotlight in Canada,Political Entertainments Coverage of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election,,,,Paper,What if You Satirized an Election and Nobody Watched?: Tina Fey and Sarah Palin Steal the Spotlight in Canada,Political Entertainments Coverage of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election,"Political satire is a unique success story in the Canadian industrys ongoing competition against American television. Fake news shows such as This Hour has 22 Minutes and The Rick Mercer Report regularly draw large audiences and are heralded as proof that Canadians are indeed interested in culturally specific entertainment even when it is
programmed against popular Hollywood fare. With a federal election scheduled for October 2008, the countrys top satirists had ample material with which to critique the five party leaders vying to lead the next Parliament. However, with the arrival of Sarah Palin (and Tina Feys remarkable rendition), Canadians turned instead to The Daily
Show, The Colbert Report, and Saturday Night Live. And despite the public pleas of party leaders, more Canadians watched the American vice-presidential debates than did the federal candidates debate when the two were scheduled for the same broadcast timeslot. I will discuss the implications of the blurring boundaries between entertainment, satire, and continental political engagement within the context of the two elections, which in the Canadian case resulted in one of the lowest voter turnouts in the nations history.

2009-1857,What is the Latino Identity?: Constructing Latino Voters in U.S. Presidential Campaign 2008,Researching Social Constructions of Identity: Examining How the Use of Keywords Enhances and Complicates Communication Scholarship,,,,Paper,What is the Latino Identity?: Constructing Latino Voters in U.S. Presidential Campaign 2008,Researching Social Constructions of Identity: Examining How the Use of Keywords Enhances and Complicates Communication Scholarship,"Latinos constitute the largest ethnic minority group in the United States and their growing political power is a topic of interest to researchers, practitioners, and citizens. Since 1980, the U.S. Democratic and Republican parties have sought to court this burgeoning group of voters, inviting their identifications and their votes. To do so, both parties have constructed what they deem to be the Latino identity (that is, who Latinos are, what issues they care about) in designing messages to invite their identifications. Drawing on Burkean identification theory, this paper reveals the discursive tactics that the parties and their candidates used to court Latinos during the 2008 Presidential Campaign. The paper focuses on one genre of campaign discourse, namely Spanish language political advertisements. Notable differences between the invitations for identification found in Spanish language and English language advertisements are revealed. Implications of this dual campaign and of elite constructions of identity are discussed"

Through a combined qualitative and quantitative approach, 336 active journalists working on different media outlets present the perspective about their profession. Four main categories emerged from the data gathered in the five most important cities in the country. While there is an important trend related to increasing the amount of people who choose this career as their college mayor, there is still a need to ameliorate the image of the profession among the persons related to the field. Problems such as the lack of social security, a decent salary and fair working conditions also merge as an important finding in the national survey and the focus group discussion."

It is central to the idea of capital itself, that social capital can be converted into other forms of capital. However, the relevance of online social capital for finding a job or getting information faster than others has not been empirically researched, yet. This paper presents results from an online survey conducted on three large German social networking sites. Our findings suggest that different types of social capital (bridging, bonding social capital, obligations) are not equally convertible into economic, symbolic, and cultural capital. There are large interpersonal differences in social capital conversion effectiveness, that are best explained by the amount of available social capital and active investments into social capital – in other words – doing networking. Surprisingly, demographic attributes and structural variables, like network size, do only affect the amount of social capital, but not the effectiveness of its conversion."

Looking Beyond the Keyword of ""9/11"" for a Polyethnic ""Word Order""","Keywords: Conceptualisations, Naming, and Meanings of Ethnicity, Race, and Diaspora","This paper uses a postcolonial lens for an alternative view of the use of '9/11' as a keyword in communication scholarship. Through a careful critique of the underlying narrative of the West encapsulated in the keyword, the paper unravels the raced, classed, and gendered nature of the canonical status accorded to 9/11. In referring to other high-impact dates of history which have not acquired keyword status, it highlights the hegemonic power of inherently monocultural Western constructions. The paper argues for a new 'word order' which can facilitate a more nuanced discussion of the contemporary world with keywords infused with polyethnic multiculturalism."

Health Literacy Leaders Say Plenty!,Health Communication Education and Collaboration,"Based on analysis of 100 in-depth interviews nationwide with academic, clinical, educational, consulting, and administrative leaders in health literacy (HL), current definitions of HL were evaluated to explore emerging themes pertaining to the status and definition of health literacy. By listening carefully and using two heuristic frames, Nutbeams (1999) tri-level model of health literacy, and an adaptation of Shannon and Weavers (1947) information model of communication, a process model of health literacy is offered that shifts the conceptual understanding of health literacy from a persistent focus on word and number literacy to more interactive and critical components, such as patient-provider communication and the ability to understand the health care system."
2009-1862,What the City Has to Teach Us,Keyword: Urban Communication,,,,Paper,What the City Has to Teach Us,Keyword: Urban Communication,"The field of communication has no center. We seem to have dozens, no, dozens too many, subsets, and little common core or language or history. We come from psychology, philosophy, journalism, the arts, social science, theater, rhetoric, new emerging technologies, law, the Chicago school, European critical studies, the entertainment industry and business schools, and so on. We use different languages and have different interests. One researchers proof is anothers folly. We fight for turf, space and time. Newcomers face the tension of whether or how to fit in with the established order or to contribute in their own unique way.

This cacophony mirrors the energy and unique perspectives of urban communication. Cities are about communication. The crowded and turbulent conditions and ever-shifting array of players require constant negotiation, complex if often unstated rules, and ongoing refinement. Communication technologies and networks, which often start and are based in cities, alter everything about communication.

This paper looks at the growing complexity of the field of communication and suggests lessons the discipline might learn from the best of urban communication"
2009-1863,What Underlies the False Consensus Effect? How Personal Opinion and Disagreement Affect Perception of Public Opinion,Opinion Perception and Expression,,,,Paper,What Underlies the False Consensus Effect? How Personal Opinion and Disagreement Affect Perception of Public Opinion,Opinion Perception and Expression,"This study draws on a sample of participants in online groups to analyze the interaction between individual-level and communicative-level factors that affect public opinion perception. We first assess the association between individual views on several issues  the death penalty, gun regulation and teaching morality in public schools  and false consensus, i.e., the tendency to attribute own views to others. We also examine whether the association between individual opinion and false consensus is mitigated by perceived disagreement with offline discussion networks and with participants in online discussion groups. As expected, not only is there a correlation between personal and perceived opinion, but also those who strongly favor the three policies estimate public support to be higher than do those who are unfavorable or moderate. Multivariate models further show that encountering disagreement, online or offline, attenuates the association between the individual opinion and false-consensus Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."
2009-1864,When a Hockey Mom Met the RNC Platinum Card,"Gender, Race, Sexuality, and the Palin Factor",,,,Paper,When a Hockey Mom Met the RNC Platinum Card,"Gender, Race, Sexuality, and the Palin Factor","In late October 2008, politico.com reported that the Republican National Committee had spent $150,000 of donations given in support of the McCain presidential campaign on clothes and make-up for the Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Sarah Palin. Primary expenditures were made at Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, high-end department stores far outside the price range of the ""working-class hockey mom"" that Palin billed herself as being. Though supporters argued that she needed a new wardrobe to compete on a national stage and that gender bias made it critical for women to cut a stylish figure, neither Palin nor the McCain strategists could answer why her new wardrobe required such financial largesse. More broadly, we might argue that Palin was merely participating in the form of image transformation we see celebrated on reality TV, where style and self-hood coalesce to make one worthy of citizenship in Makeover Nation. These narratives depart, however, in who pays for such changes (a television show or donor dollars) and the degree to which the makeover is a means to an end or the end in itself."
2009-1865,When Authority Lacks Legitimate Power: Twin Sisters Negotiating Face and Relational Concerns in Advice Episodes,The Interactional Achievement of Family Roles and Family Relationships,,,,Paper,When Authority Lacks Legitimate Power: Twin Sisters Negotiating Face and Relational Concerns in Advice Episodes,The Interactional Achievement of Family Roles and Family Relationships,"This study springs from a larger study (Gornick, 2004) of siblings construction of advice episodes and their negotiation of the instrumental, identity, and relational goals (Clark & Delia, 1979) relevant to the proffering and receipt of advice. That study demonstrated that because advice episodes inherently raise face concerns about both Control/Authority and Intimacy issues, they are particularly useful for exploring the conversational practices close relational partners utilize in the co-construction of their relationships. Findings of that study demonstrate that advice episodes are composed of three sequentially-ordered interactional tasks: 1)Problem Construction, 2) Issuing Advice, and 3) Receipt of Advice. Moreover, the construction of each sequentially-ordered segment invariably included facework and relationship-work relevant to interactants roles as Older and Younger Siblings.
The findings of the larger study, therefore, provided the opportunity to explore Advice Episodes where Older/Younger Sibling roles are problematized by a legitimate lack of what French & Ravens (1957) classic study described as legitimate power. The study reported here involves Twin Sisters negotiating an advice episode where the potential advice-giver initiates the construction of her sisters problem in a Physiology class shes taking. Findings of the study suggest that both sisters orient to and address face and relational concerns as they co-construct all three segments of the advice episode. More specifically, Problem Construction, Advice Proffering, and Advice Receipt are achieved with conversational practices that 1) address how initiating and responding actions are accomplished, 2) work to resist construction of the segment or address such resistance, and 3)minimize face concerns (e.g. by softening claims of authority) and relational concerns (e.g., by invoking Snookie, a stuffed animal, as a third participant in the conversation). The study contributes to our understandings of both the construction of Advice Episodes and Sibling relational roles."
2009-1866,When Citizens Meet Experts: Effects of Issue Experts Mental Models on Citizens Opinion as Textual Network (Top Paper),Political Cognition: How People Process Political Messages,,,,Paper,When Citizens Meet Experts: Effects of Issue Experts Mental Models on Citizens Opinion as Textual Network (Top Paper),Political Cognition: How People Process Political Messages,"Despite the large volume of empirical deliberation studies, researchers have given little effort to the analysis of citizens verbal expressions themselves. This paper connects theoretical frameworks in cognitive complexity and political sophistication (Sniderman et al., 1991; Tetlock, 2004) with methodological advances in textual network analysis (Carley & Palmquist, 1992; Popping, 2006). We examine how deliberators mental models are transformed by the group condition. For the textual network analysis, saved transcripts of online deliberators about the health-care policy were analyzed. To warrant the validity of the properties of our textual network measures, three variables (need for cognition, health-care knowledge, and argument repertoire) are adopted as validity criteria. Our results demonstrate that ordinary citizens who met and discussed with elites in an earlier interaction ,express in the next deliberation more diverse ideas that are more complexly interconnected , whereas elites who talked with other elites depress the range of concepts and the complexity of their interconnections in subsequent interactions."
2009-1867,When Good Characters Do Bad Things: Examining the Effect of Moral Ambiguity on Enjoyment,Our Relationships With Media Characters,,,,Paper,When Good Characters Do Bad Things: Examining the Effect of Moral Ambiguity on Enjoyment,Our Relationships With Media Characters,"Much research has examined responses to consistently good and consistently bad characters. However, some of the most compelling characters do not fall into either of these categories, because they do both good and bad things. The present study empirically tests the effects of morally ambiguous, good, and bad characters on audience responses. Findings reveal that different character types are appealing for different reasons. Specifically, good characters are enjoyed because they are well liked; bad characters are liked the least, but they are equally as transporting, suspenseful, and thus cognitively engaging as other characters. Morally ambiguous characters, on the other hand, are liked less than good characters, but they are nevertheless equally as transporting, suspenseful, cognitively engaging, and thereby enjoyable as good characters. This study thus provides a deeper understanding of the ways in which different character types affect enjoyment. The implications of these findings on various media effects theories are discussed."
2009-1868,When Good News is Bad News: Explicating the Moderated Mediation Dynamics Behind the Reversed Mobilization Effect,Framing and Framing Effects (High Density),,,,Paper,When Good News is Bad News: Explicating the Moderated Mediation Dynamics Behind the Reversed Mobilization Effect,Framing and Framing Effects (High Density),"Previous research has repeatedly shown that negative information and negative attitudes have a stronger impact on subsequent evaluations and behavior than their positive equivalents. However, we claim that individual perceptions of message content are key to understand the underlying psychological processes. In an experiment (N=743) we investigated the mobilizing potential of positive news framing on opponents of a referendum proposal. Our mediation analysis suggests that positive news framing, endorsing a referendum proposal, was perceived as negative by opponents and mobilized them to turn out and vote because of increased risk perception. This reversed mobilization effect was moderated by existing levels of political efficacy. Efficacious opponents were significantly more mobilized by the positive framing than opponents with low efficacy. We conclude with a discussion under which conditions the reversed mobilization dynamic is likely to unfold during an election campaign."
2009-1869,When Harm Is Done: Legitimization and Corporate Social Responsibility,Corporate Politics/ Consumer Politics,,,,Paper,When Harm Is Done: Legitimization and Corporate Social Responsibility,Corporate Politics/ Consumer Politics,"This paper provides a theoretical analysis of how harmful events are transformed discursively and institutionally into issues for public deliberation and debate in a way that has significant ideological implications for the thematic, causal, and remedial framing of social problems. We look at the responses to a death that resulted from routine corporate practices, namely the disconnection of the electricity supply to a Samoan family living in Auckland, New Zealand, on the part of local community activists, the news media, the government, the corporation involved, its parent company, and the general public. Using Luhmanns theory of normative and cognitive expectations, and Habermass theory of procedural modes of legitimization and system/lifeworld relations, we argue that although the electricity supply corporation was targeted for vocal criticism it was nonetheless able to take control of defining the emergent issue in terms of an individualized conception of future risk avoidance, and repair the threat to its legitimacy in procedural rather than substantive or normative terms. The effect of this was to occlude other modes of thematic framing, particularly that of government responsibility for the provision of essential public services, from public debate and consideration."

This behavior might either be motivated by the wish to affiliate with other people and build new relationships or by impression management tendencies. We conducted three studies (content analysis, qualitative interview, online survey) to investigate the motives for users to become a member of these groups. A content analysis with 100 profiles demonstrated that users do not actively discuss or contribute postings within groups. The qualitative interview (N=12) indicated that users select their groups carefully in order to influence the impression readers will form. Finally, an online survey with 128 participants confirms that people intentionally use the group memberships to engage in self-presentation with regard to their interests and attitudes. However, the frequency of actual contributions within the group is affected by the individual need to affiliate."
2009-1871,When Journalism and Marketing Intersect in TV News Programs: A Case Study of Taiwans Product Placement Research and Its Implications for Global Television Programs,Contemporary Perspectives on the Performance of the Press,,,,Paper,When Journalism and Marketing Intersect in TV News Programs: A Case Study of Taiwans Product Placement Research and Its Implications for Global Television Programs,Contemporary Perspectives on the Performance of the Press,"Product placement in TV programs has become increasingly common in the last decade. Although it arouses huge controversies over media credibility and marketing values, up to date, there have been very limited empirical studies focusing on audience reception of product placement messages, particularly in television news programs in which product placements were usually forbidden in use.
The current study examined a unique program genre in Taiwan, prime-time TV news programs, in which product placements are still in use, in order to investigate the effectiveness and controversies of product placement in news media.
Based on empirical findings, this study will shed some light on how we define the boundaries of news and marketing information. Product placements are proven to be quite effective in television news programs. However, the effectiveness is built right on the cost of news credibility and integrity, which is ironically distinguishing product placement and advertising and is believed to be the magic power of product placement in news. This paper will further discuss what the findings of this particular case study imply to the universal product placement research literature."

Partisan Moderators of Mass Medias Agenda-Setting Influence on Parliament in Belgium,"""What to Think About?"" and ""How to Think?"" (Attribute) Agenda Setting Studies","In this study we investigate which factors moderate the agenda-setting influence of mass media on the Belgian Parliament during the period 1993-2000. Based on elaborate codings of media, parliamentary questions and interpellations, party manifestoes, government agreements and ministerial meetings, we employ a multilevel time-series model. The results indicate that especially party characteristics (size party, incumbent or opposition party, issue-ownership) and the governmental agenda influence the dependency of Parliament on media coverage. Furthermore, we find an increase in the size of media influence throughout time, suggesting the increasing presence of media logic. Irrespective of all those contingent factors, mass media determine the Belgian parliamentary agenda to a considerable extent."

The resulting aftermath included both hoped for changes in stimulating a visible and vigorous national conversation concerning challenges and needs of higher education as well as intensified commitments to a number of voluntary actions to address acknowledged problems and missed opportunities in higher education. However, unanticipated and unintended outcomes were created through this change initiative as well including harm to mutual trust and respect between government and the higher education community. This paper explores the Spellings Commissions attempts to create change in higher education as a case of inter-institutional change. Drawing from Lewis (2007) model of change implementation and Stakeholder Theory, the case examines interaction among stakeholders in the higher education community and discusses how these interactions played key determining roles in the outcomes of this change initiative."

The story of AIDS in Africa is also one of controversies. Responses from African populations and leadership were complex right from the start. Today, attitudes and perspectives about AIDS are as diverse as the continent itself. As the number of people living with HIV/AIDS increased, it became evident that the HIV work cannot solely concern prevention: the lives of people affected cannot be overlooked. As a result, the fight against AIDS has become two-fold: preventing new infections and improving the life of the individuals living with the disease. At the center of the work on improving the life of PLAs is the fight to eliminate stigma because of its damaging impact on PLAs treatment, their physical and social well being as well as their overall quality of life. UNAIDS (2002) defined stigma as a quality that significantly discredits an individual in the eyes of others.
The present study explores HIV/AIDS stigma in the family context from the lens of PLAs in Dakar, Senegal.
Four focus groups and 10 individual interviews were completed. Seven key features of family stigma were identified: 1) Cultural and social stigma, 2) dynamic stigma , 3) financial or need-based stigma, 4) double stigmas, 5) strategic disclosure decisions, 6) stigma and social-familial relationships, as well as 7) stigma and self-concept."

Using data from 291 working adults in a wide variety of occupations, structural equation modeling showed that employees perceptions of informational justice, meeting effectiveness, and meeting practices in supervisor-run meetings related significantly to perceived quality of their relationship with their supervisors (LMX), the organization (perceived organizational support), and meeting citizenship behaviors. Results indicate LMX served a mediating role in the relationships between supervisor actions during meetings and both perceived organizational support and meeting citizenship behaviors. The main implication of the study is that during meetings they run, supervisors have the potential to influence not only subordinates perceptions of the supervisor and subordinate behavior during meetings, but also subordinates view of the organization."

The paradoxical goals of the Working Class Promise (i.e., class maintenance) and the American Dream (i.e., class mobility) give rise to class mobility-based ambivalences. Working class individuals who have experienced class mobility reconcile ensuing ambivalences by discursively positioning themselves as members of an undifferentiated working class. Whereas it may appear that this move dismisses the salience of class in their lives, they in fact engage in strategic, complex, and nuanced class-based identity work."

I argue that sports journalism invoked and negotiated the memory of Katrina and produced largely uniform media narrative  one which relentlessly employed a winning team as the trope for metaphorical recovery and a means of the collective simultaneously coping with and escaping from traumatic memory. Moreover, I problematize the fact that, at a time the city was still in need of real  not just mythic  solutions, a storyline of triumph was diffused with little critique."
2009-1878,When Things Speak: Ventriloquized Figures in Reported Speech,tudies in Language & Social Interaction Research,,,,Paper,When Things Speak: Ventriloquized Figures in Reported Speech,Studies in Language & Social Interaction Research,"This paper is an exploration of the ventriloquist metaphor and how it may be applied to notions of reported speech. This paper is partly inspired by presentations by Cooren (2008) and Mirivel (2008) in a panel on argument-making at the 2008 International Communication Association conference. I draw from Goffman (1974, 1981) and Bakhtin (1981), both of whom articulated a conceptualization of ventriloquism as a mode of speaking. I argue that ventriloquism is a useful explanatory figure for disambiguating and enlarging notions of reported speech, and that it has a functional basis in argumentation. I begin by reviewing ways in which ventriloquism has been extended. I follow by reviewing different ways of looking reported speech and quoting, and how the idea of ventriloquism could provide a meta-analysis of reported speech that accommodates for all forms of speaking for another. I analyze several examples of reported speech from a variety of sources and data to determine the range and applicability of this concept in understanding reported speech."

How Can I Get There? Impact of Navigability and Narrative Transportation on Spatial Presence,Keywords in Information Systems: Narrative (High Density),"From video games to virtual worlds on the Web, modern media are becoming increasingly spatial, with users traversing artificial spaces and experiencing a kind of immersion known as spatial presence. But, how do these media induce spatial presence? Are the special affordances (or action possibilities) provided by these technologies responsible for this illusion? Or do narratives that accompany them persuade us to suspend disbelief and transport ourselves into a virtual space? We explore these theoretical questions by pitting the navigability affordances of a videogame with narrative transportation, and examining their relative contributions to the formation of spatial presence in the context of VR game. Results from a large experiment (N = 240) reveal that narrative actually detracts from spatial presence while traversibility (in the form of greater degrees of steering motion) enhances it even without invoking a mental model of the portrayed environment. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Specifically, Google claims to offer a wider variety of perspectives than other news sites as a result of the news aggregation process. We tested this notion by examining the frequency articles retrieved by news aggregators (Google News and Yahoo! News) and non-aggregators websites cited sources like medical journals, universities, hospitals, NCI, and ACS. We find evidence of significant differences between the two Internet-based news websites on a number of categories, but non-aggregators appear to cite significantly more sources on multiple levels. Implications of these findings and others are discussed, and future exploration posited."

Looking for Religion in Media and Cultural Studies,Media Studies and the Question of Religion: The Challenges of the Religious Object,"Considering the central role that religion played in the development of classical social theory, it is relatively absent from the founding classical texts in communication, media and cultural studies. In this paper, I consider how theories of secularization as well as particular definitions of religion implicitly informed the social and intellectual landscapes of early media studies in the US (1930s-1960s), and cultural studies in Britain (1970s-1980s). Drawing upon these historical examples, I conclude by surveying contemporary terms such as ""religious resurgence,"" ""fundamentalism,"" or ""spirituality,"" and the ways in which they implicitly inform contemporary media and cultural studies discourse."

This essay challenges the assumption that volume is power and explores an alternative mode of vocal emissionthe whisper. Weak in volume and yet persistent in resonation, evanescent in space and yet lingering in time, elusive to knowledge and yet haunting to the unconscious desires, whispering brings into question some key assumptions about the relationships among voice, body, space, and power. Commonly used as a private mode of address (by mothers, lovers, friends, etc.), whispering bears the imprint of domesticity and femininity, but is hardly ever related to publicity. In the rare case in which whispering is associated with politics, e.g. the whispering politicians, it reminds us of secret plots, double dealings, and the obscene underside of publicity. Is whispering doomed to turn sour when it enters the public? What does it mean to whisper in public? Can we bring out the subversive power of whispering and make it a political act? This essay explores the various ramifications of whispering in physiology, theology, sociology, psychoanalysis, ethics, and politics, and theorizes a new type of political agency that is urgently needed in our contemporary lo-fi worldthe world of attention deficit and volume anxiety."
2009-1883,Whites in a Non-White Mind: Ethnographic Study of White Perception in Japan,Meanings of Difference and Identity Construction in Media Consumption,,,,Paper,Whites in a Non-White Mind: Ethnographic Study of White Perception in Japan,Meanings of Difference and Identity Construction in Media Consumption,"Abstract
This ethnographic study analyzes Japanese perceptions of racial otherness, with a focus on Japanese perceptions of White Westerners. Despite the countrys pronounced lack of racially non-Japanese and non-Asians, Japan is arguably one of the most Westernized non-Western societies in the world today. Under this presumption, this essay explores how Japanese introduced, interpreted, and incorporated images of White Westerners. The empirical study confirms that overly positive images and affirmations of White Westerners are a central theme in the Japanese imagination. In addition, the study suggests some complexities in Japanese peoples consumption of racial imaginations. These complexities include (1) how Japanese people use images of Whites when they see their own skin tone and other phenotypic features, (2) some of the psychological struggles that Japanese people experience when they actually associate themselves with White Westerners, and (3) a few antithetic perceptions that Japanese people have of the dominant racial ideology, an ideology that praises Whites."
2009-1884,Who Gives Care to the Caregiver: Effects of Online Social Support Groups on Wellbeing of People Taking Care of Others?,"Online Social Support, Information, and Health Communication",,,,Paper,Who Gives Care to the Caregiver: Effects of Online Social Support Groups on Wellbeing of People Taking Care of Others?,"Online Social Support, Information, and Health Communication","Online Social Support Groups (OSSGs) can play an important role for people who seek support for, or information about, dealing with a medical condition. However, this study does not focus on people that experience such a condition firsthand, but investigates how OSSGs may be useful for a special group of users, being caregivers. So, we concentrate not on the people that suffer from a medical condition themselves, but focus our attention to the people that take care of them (being relatives, friends, neighbors, etc.). The paper is based on an online questionnaire among caregivers that take part in an OSSG (N = 66). Results show that people who perceive higher caregiver strain participate in OSSGs in order to feel better and to seek emotional support to a higher extent than people with a lower caregiver strain. Results also show a negative relation between caregiver strain and wellbeing. However, this relation is moderated by OSSG participation. The amount of time people spend on the forum is no significant moderator, but the amount of activity (measured by the number of messages posted per week) is. Results show that for people that are more active on the forum (i.e. that post more messages) the relation between caregiver strain and wellbeing is significantly less negative than for more passive users. This supports the assumption that taking part in OSSGs can have positive effects on peoples wellbeing, but especially for people that take an active role in these groups."

Journalists rely on people to tell them about the issues and events. The term elite sources refers to representatives of major institutions: government officials, academicians, experts on particular events and topics. This paper will report on the nature and composition of sources that appear in foreign news stories in several countries. The data are derived from an analysis of the actors appearing in the news items in the international study of television conducted in nearly 20 countries. Central research questions include: what is the nature of the sources that appear in foreign news stories; to what extent are local sources (from the country of broadcast) used in the stories; and what play are the sources given in terms of being seen on the screen or merely quoted."

Participants were presented with three hypothetical stories in one of two conditions; one where consultants market research was relied on to make news judgments, the other in which a news directors judgments were used to make decisions. The experiment was designed to determine if the newsroom condition causes them to choose the consultant or manager as the one in control of story selection. This research finds when participants are placed in a situation where the consultant rules they are more likely to agree with the consultant decisions versus the manager."

Or, How Sarah Palin is Forcing Us to Sort Out Our Feminisms","Gender, Race, Sexuality, and the Palin Factor","Sarah Palin has alternately infuriated, puzzled, and in some cases (Camille Paglia's at least), impressed feminists. What is it about Palin, or rather her public construction, that has feminists on edge? Based on a comprehensive reading of Palin commentary by feminist journalists, columnists, and bloggers, I argue that Palin is so incendiary because she forces us to revisit some old sores in feminism, including debates around motherhood, beauty, and race, but also because she raises the spectre of an emergent ""conservative feminism,"" a discourse with some historical roots, but one whose contradictions undermine feminism as a progressive, or even a coherent, discourse."

In this paper I argue that that Whos Nailin Paylin exploits Palins sexualized image as a political babean image she actively perpetuatesand uses porns lowbrow status as an opportunity to generate a critique of Palins candidacy that would impermissible in more respectable media outlets."

Though research hints at its importance in improving self-esteem and maintaining personal relationships, this form of social support and the interactions in which it is provided have received relatively little research attention. This study, derived from the naturalistic paradigm of social support, explores various characteristics of esteem support situations. Participants (N = 59) recalled two recent esteem threatening situations, one for which they had received helpful esteem support messages, and another for which they received unhelpful esteem support messages. Participants recalled the content of these messages and rated them on items assessing the degree to which they affected various aspects of self-esteem. They also indicated the nature of the esteem threats they had experienced (e.g., failure, rejection) and the domains in which the threats occurred (e.g., academics, family). Finally, participants provided characteristics of the sources of the esteem support messages. Messages and features of situations were coded. Results indicate that the helpfulness of esteem support messages is partially dependent on the domain of esteem threat experienced and characteristics of esteem support providers. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."
2009-1890,Why Did Americans Invent the News Interview?,Keyword: The Interview (Cross Unit),,,,Paper,Why Did Americans Invent the News Interview?,Keyword: The Interview (Cross Unit),"Today American journalists are not global journalism's only interviewers and may or may not be the world's best in terms of their ability to lead interviewees to say something profound, significant, revealing, or discrediting about themselves or others. But American newspaper journalists were the world's FIRST interviewers in the late 19th century and were interview-evangelists, teaching their European colleagues during World War I how to use interviewing in gathering news.

But why? Is there or was there something American about interviewing? What cultural or historical premises are embedded in the practice of journalistic interviewing that we take so much for granted today? What are the social and cultural presuppositions of the practice? Based on a historical account of how American and European journalists responded to interviewing in the period 1870-1940, this paper will try to tease out some answers."

Despite its theoretical and practical importance, civility has rarely been examined in empirical research of political discussion. To investigate effects of uncivil expression of disagreement, named discursive incivility, this study examines its independent and joint effects with other factors (i.e., disagreement, discussion goal, and closeness of discussion partner) on participants emotions and deliberative attitudes. Specifically, this study proposes that discursive incivility induces defensive or hostile reactions instead of deliberative ones through individuals negative feeling of immorality of such uncivil behaviors, which I term moral indignation. To test proposed idea, this study employs a novel approach to isolation of causal effects by using simulated online discussion to experimentally manipulate message characteristics in a timed script that participants believed to be a discussion with other participants. The results showed that discursive incivility from unlike-minded partners had greater erosive effects on moral indignation and open-mindedness than did discursive incivility from like-minded partners. In addition, findings showed that the erosive effects of discursive incivility of unlike-minded partners on deliberative attitudes were mediated by moral indignation to discussion partners discussion behaviors. Finally, the results showed that the strength of the discursive incivility effect on moral indignation toward unlike-minded partners was affected by contextual factors (i.e., discussion goal and closeness of partners)."

Six common explanations of anti-American sentiment are tested by employing cross-national survey data collected in both African and non-African Muslim countries. The analyses suggest important differences between regions in terms of media environment and religious identity were found to be significant factors explaining the variation in anti-American sentiment between African and non-African Muslims. In addition, African Muslims are more favorable toward the U.S. because they feel less threatened by the United States, are more likely to perceive the United States as a solution to worsening political or socio-economic conditions in their own countries, and express higher levels of identification with American culture and society compared to Muslims in other regions. Implications for U.S. foreign policy and public diplomacy efforts are discussed."
2009-1893,Why People Conceal or Reveal Secrets: A Multiple Goals Theory Perspective,Theoretical Advances in Disclosure and Avoidance Decisions,,,,Paper,Why People Conceal or Reveal Secrets: A Multiple Goals Theory Perspective,Theoretical Advances in Disclosure and Avoidance Decisions,"The purpose of this manuscript is to examine the reasons people conceal or reveal secrets from a multiple goals theory perspective. Our main argument is not only that individuals are acting upon multiple goals when they decide to conceal or reveal secret information, but also that the goals that people bring to their decisions about keeping or revealing secrets provide important information about individuals, their social interactions, and their relationships. In making this argument, we first critically examine how scholars have conceptualized secrecy. Then, we discuss the implications of viewing secrecy from a multiple goals perspective. Next, we review the literatures on reasons for concealing secrets as well as criteria for revealing secrets. We also consider issues that emerge from examining these two literatures together. Finally, we put forth a number of general propositions that illustrate the heuristic value of studying concealing and revealing secrets from a multiple goals perspective."
2009-1894,Why Production Still Matters,Are We Free Yet? Popular Media Production and Scholarship Today,,,,Paper,Why Production Still Matters,Are We Free Yet? Popular Media Production and Scholarship Today,"New forms of participation enabled by new digital technologies have led to a series of claims concerning profound transformations of relations between cultural production and consumption. Yochai Benkler, for example, has argued that we are beginning to see economic and cultural transformations that make possible a radical transformation of the production of information. Some have even argued that the very division between production and consumption has broken down. This paper critiques such claims, as they appear in a number of recent accounts, on substantive and on normative grounds. First, it questions the caricatured portrayal of previous eras of media production. Second, it critiques the simplistic celebration of freedom and participation, and the neglect of questions concerning truth, justice and the good life. Instead, the paper argues for the continuing primacy of production within the media process, grounded in a critical realist media politics, with causality at its heart.

First, the paper summarizes the elements of self according to James and how the possible selves could be drawn upon in a persuasive communication context. It is suggested that there are at least two approaches to studying possible selves from an empirical perspective: the accessibility of one self out of a field of many possible selves, and the synthesis of potentially conflicting selves. However, it is argued that Jamess work should also inspire further exploration of the experience of self as that which provides a sense of continuity despite substantively and temporally variable possible selves. This sense of personal identity cannot be interrogated via traditional empirical methods, according to James. A greater attunement to this sense of self has potential to enhance communication experiences."

An Exploration of Adolescent Friendship Formation Online in Teen Second Life,"Self Presentation, Representation, and Affiliation","Although there have been many studies of the effect that online friendships have on adolescents, fewer have investigated how young people form friendships online. Those that have studied online friendship have found that it is generally different than real-world friendship in form and function. This study applies Monge & Contractors (2003) Multi-theoretical Multilevel model to study the emergence of adolescent friendships in the online world. This study presents the results of a large scale social network analysis based on computer logs of friendships in Teen Second Life , an online social world for adolescents age 13-17. Results suggest that friendship formation follows several predictable patterns found in the real world, but not found in all previous studies of online friendship formation among adolescents, including tendencies towards balance and a preference for friends of high status and friends who are geographically, temporally, and physically proximate. These findings indicate that online friendship patterns in Teen Second Life mirror those found in real life."

Chinas political freedom was found to be significant in predicting the U.S. medias coverage of China and Americans opinion toward China, with more freedom leading to more positive coverage and more favorable opinions. The valence of news coverage shows a positive effect on Americans opinions toward China even when controlling for political, economic development and public relations effort. Chinas public relations effort in the U.S. has a positive effect on the valence of coverage China received in the U.S. media with more public relations contracts leading to more positive coverage."

This presentation explores the findings of a content analysis-based study of a representative sample of 140 hours of childrens fiction programming broadcast in seven countries during the spring of 2007. The corpus consisted of commercial and public broadcasts, mostly produced in the U.S. and exported to the rest of the participating countries. Findings suggest that contrary to expectations, these programs presented a world dominated by the presence of children, devoid of families. The families portrayed for younger audiences were quite traditional in nature with an at-home Mom, in contrast to more non-traditional families for older viewers. Most non-family adults in televised-childrens lives are males, who seem to serve a variety of mentoring functions; however, other males are presented as enemies of children who need to be resisted."

The panelists will review the existing scholarship about womens voices in organizations in the United States, and will reconsider this body of literature by drawing on this case study and by reflecting on the associations between masculinity and whiteness as taken for granted, particularly in homogeneous communities with few minorities."

The panelist will employ a critical studies framework in the analysis of data from interviews with women of both major ethnic groups in Fiji, Fijian and Indian, in the capital city of Suva. Fiji is a country functioning on partrilineal principles; however, race and ethnicity are important factors of difference among women. When interviewed, women acknowledged identifying themselves first with race and then with gender; yet women of both ethnicities stated that they were subject to gender-based violence in the workplace. The presenter will report on whether these subjections to violence have prompted women to look for ways of collaborating with women of the same ethnicity or interethnically, and how women working outside of the household in a country in which men traditionally work outside of the home have found their voices, and ways to have their voices heard, in the workplace."

Over the past 150 years, Kyrgyzstan transitioned from an uncharted land of nomads, to a Soviet Union republic, to an independent semi-democratic state with market economy. These transitions have created a unique ground for practices of gender, which has not been explored by scholars yet. The panelist will discuss the opportunities for women to become involved in organizations and to create networks among themselves, and will analyze how women from different parts of the country and in diverse organizational settings (in which genders are mixed) describe their roles, their status, and their relationships. The presentation will focus on the intersections between and among dimensions of gender, power, and identity in organizations in Kyrgyzstan."

Finding a voice in Romania, as elsewhere in post-communist East Europe, is difficult; communist constructs pertinent to voice no longer apply, but new constructs to be employed by women and men in the exercise of finding and expressing a voice have not been crystallized yet. Thus, studying womens voices, in and out of organizational settings, in this part of the world and in this country, is a hard but exciting task. In the contexts of postcommunist and of the European integration, women had found themselves in more aggressive competition with men and among themselves on the job market and in the workplace, yet they have also identified ways to empower themselves, to become more active and assertive in a variety of organizational settings."

Gender-related policy language promises a great deal, for example, to enhance the role, position and status of women to ensure their participation as equal partners in national development. Nevertheless, discriminatory practices are such that few women hold high-level positions in industry, education, or government sectors. In addition, the Malaysian government undermines its own policy initiatives in its failure to address the multiple layers of discrimination faced by women, including those related to competing responsibilities of career and family. Based in empirical research conducted in Malaysia, this paper also describes how forms of discrimination lead to a trend in which high-skilled female technology workers increasingly emigrate to countries including the US, the UK, and Singapore rather than remain in Malaysia as resources that can be mobilized to support the national economic development agenda.

Besides alerting a nation to a serious gendered crisis, such information would possibly have informed and influenced womens political behavior at the polls. As one woman said, For me, the economy is the No. 1 issue  the candidate who comes up with the best plan to help women who are struggling financially will get my vote (Johnson, 2008, ¶ 6). The paper poses and applies a feminist theory of social responsibility in evaluating the primary season coverage in New York Times and Washington Post. The analysis concludes that the two agenda-setting papers fell short in their responsibility to meet the tenets of the theory."
2009-1906,Women War Correspondents: Does Gender Make a Difference on the Front Line?,News and Gender,,,,Paper,Women War Correspondents: Does Gender Make a Difference on the Front Line?,News and Gender,"Although there have been women reporters on the front lines since the First World War and their number has increased more and more in subsequent conflicts in the twentieth century, it was only during the first Gulf War that the phenomenon gained momentum. The visibility of women war correspondents on national and international television channels is now taken for granted; and women journalists from newspapers have stood by the side of their male colleagues when covering the conflicts.

This paper deals with the controversial question of whether or not women journalists covering the news from the front lines speak in a different voice from their male counterparts. War offers a special opportunity for exploring such a question, since it is particularly in war that the agenda and the rules of the game of still mostly male-dominated journalism come to the fore. This paper, based on research still in progress, aims at investigating whether women journalists (or at least some of them, in specific circumstances), once they have been admitted to the male preserve of foreign correspondents and furthermore to the most masculine of action systems such as war, are willing and able to create their own gender-based agenda and express their own point of view. To some extent, the creation of such an agenda may be encouraged and facilitated by the rise of so-called journalism of attachment, caring as much as knowing, as an ethical alternative to the professional golden rule of detached objectivity."

It further argues that, with the availability of desktop computers and specialized off-the-shelf software, this is the golden age in terms of the scholarly analysis of textual messages. The presentation will demonstrate current applications of three software programs (QDA Miner, WordStat, and Diction 5.0) to analyze such topics as network TV news economic reporting, network TV news presidential campaign reporting, classified advertisements for college graduates, and presidential campaign commercials. In all of these cases, the software enabled researchers to study variables with 100% reliability and with more objectivity than possible by traditional human coding."

The aims of our paper are to reflect on how the intellectual and the social dimension of science and its environments are related to each other, to reflect different factors of disciplinary development, to provide a system of categories for research, and finally to discuss whether historical research is compatible with theoretically deduced proceeding. After a brief discussion of different approaches in German and American historiography of mass communication research  such as intellectual, biographical and institutional approaches  we develop and explain an integrated model of disciplinary historiography that meets the demands of social sciences: theoretical foundation, methodological reflection and transparency. In a third step we discuss whether the principles of social-scientific research, especially theoretically deduced proceeding, are compatible with those of historiographic inquiry. It will be important for us to consider that our approach has to be sensitive to historical circumstances."
2009-1910,Yellow Journalism and the Genesis of the Publicity Industries,Public Relations Poster Session,,,,Paper,Yellow Journalism and the Genesis of the Publicity Industries,Public Relations Poster Session,"How can the late 19th century American print culture lend to an understanding of the genesis of public relations as an industry? This paper aims to define this question by providing historical context to the understudied period in which public relations began to take shape as an industry. Putting these two areas of scholarship in dialog will allow new insight into the print culture that shaped the high-low split in popular amusements and informed early theorists of public opinion whose works became the foundation for a nascent public relations industry. Many historians of public relations offer only brief references to the period before George Michaelis Publicity Bureau set up shop in 1900. But the first public relations firm did not spring from a void, and many questions about early publicity remain unresolved. Turn-of-the-century American journalism and the New York paper circulation wars acted as the crucible in which modern public relations took shape and, eventually, professional form. Taking a fresh look at the cultural-historical beginnings of public relations can bring new insight into how the field has evolved, how its professional development has reflected larger social dynamics and where public relations as both a practice and subject of scholarship theory might advance."
2009-1911,You as a Commodity of Google: Examining Audience Commodification of Google,Critical and Cultural Perspectives on ICTs,,,,Paper,You as a Commodity of Google: Examining Audience Commodification of Google,Critical and Cultural Perspectives on ICTs,"This paper examines the process of audience commodification of Google, the most popular search engine in the U.S. The author reviews literature related to audience commodification in traditional media. Based on those theoretical foundations, the author analyzes the mechanisms of audience commodification via Google and dissects the components of its audiences as its commodities.
In the political economy perspective, this paper argues that Googles huge surplus value from advertising is resulted from extensive commodification of its users. Unique features of Google as an advertisement venue intensify commodifications of its users. The author argues that the simplified valorization process of Googles advertising methods enables Google to earn significant more surplus values than those of traditional media do. Also, Googles personalized advertising strategies, a precise measurement of advertising cost, which is based on users behaviors represented as a number of clicks, and the unclear distinction between advertisements and serviced contents commodify its users online activities. Lastly, the author asserts that Google commodify the aggregated consciousnesses of its users because Google sells keywords that advertisers want to expose their advertisements along with search outputs of those, which are literally priced in accordance with their popularities."

Sixty-two pairs participated in an iterative social dilemma investment game and periodically communicated via Instant Messenger (IM). Novel automated and manual analysis techniques identify linguistic accommodation at verbatim and semantic levels. Our results contribute to the trust and computer-mediated communication literatures: Good accommodation (linguistic mimicry, similarity in use of positive and task-related words) is associated with high levels of interpersonal trust while bad accommodation (e.g. similarity in use of negative words) is associated with low levels of interpersonal trust."
2009-1913,Young People and the Digital Divide: An Ethnographic Study of Media-Have-Less Youths,Cultural Appropriations of New Communication Technologies,,,,Paper,Young People and the Digital Divide: An Ethnographic Study of Media-Have-Less Youths,Cultural Appropriations of New Communication Technologies,"Focusing on two keywords in communication studies  digital divide and youths, this paper sheds light on media-have-less youths in Singapore to understand how they cope with life in a media-have society, where the use of the mobile phone and the Internet is pervasive. Given such a media landscape, media consumers are more usefully classified as media-have and media-have-less. In this study, media-have-less is defined as those who do not enjoy home Internet access. Based on media diaries and post-diary interviews with youths of different ages, this study finds that, deprived of home Internet access, media-have-less youths have significantly smaller media repertoires than their media-have counterparts. Despite the ease with which media-have-less youths could secure Internet access through friends, relatives and public services, the inferior quality of their Internet access adversely impacted on their depth of media experience and the scope and intensity of their learning experiences. Their intermittent Internet use did not afford them the luxury of non-directed online exploration but led to task-oriented Internet use which denied them the opportunity to hone their media multi-tasking and online multi-tasking abilities. Their understanding of the Internet and its capabilities was superficial and each online experience did not build significantly on the last, confined instead to a small realm of habitual activities. The findings suggest that in media-have societies where information technology is widely used in all facets of life, more needs to be done to enhance the media and Internet skills of the media-have-less to minimise their risks of social exclusion."

She has also been the subject of pubic opinion polls that capture snapshot feelings about Palins preparation and suitability for a higher role in office. The goal of this presentation is to discuss the cultural contradictions of an ideal Anglo American motherhood, as framed in the press. In particular the research will examine the creation and framing of motherhood as revealed in select Latino and African American online ethnic/racial presses. The research asks whether the ethnic/racial presses construct Palin as defying an idealized Anglo American motherhood role as overly aggressive and gun-shooting or some other construction. This research sheds light on the unique lenses and framing processes that ethnic/racial presses have regarding women leaders in the United States."
2009-1915,Youth 2 Youth: Changing Palestinian-American Images and Stereotypes Through Facebook,"Offline Culture, Online Behavior",,,,Paper,Youth 2 Youth: Changing Palestinian-American Images and Stereotypes Through Facebook,"Offline Culture, Online Behavior","An online field experiment gathering young Americans and Palestinians in a closed Facebook group investigated the influence of online social networking on the perceived images and stereotypes held by both national groups about each other, as well as its influence on the participants sense of social capital, in its offline and online dimensions. The findings suggested that the Facebook group interaction positively influenced the way participants perceived each other, with greater change in American participants. Both national groups enhanced their positive associations of the other, while Palestinians did not improve with regards to their negative associations of Americans. Online social networking via Facebook influenced participants bridging social capital. Participants showed higher regard to their offline social capital than their online social capital (Facebook group). The findings are discussed in perspective to the role of online social networking in global communications and grassroots-driven public diplomacy."
2009-1916,YouTube Ads: An Issue Ownership Study of the 2008 Presidential Primary Campaign,Political Communication Poster Session,,,,Paper,YouTube Ads: An Issue Ownership Study of the 2008 Presidential Primary Campaign,Political Communication Poster Session,"This study applied Issue Ownership theory to Democratic and Republican candidate ads on YouTube. Ads from the presidential primary campaign posted on the site during May 2007  February 5, 2008 (Super Tuesday) were content analyzed. The findings were consistent with the predictions of Issue Ownership theory: Candidates emphasize their own party issues more than opposition party issues. The top five issue themes talked about by Democratic candidates are: Healthcare (Democratic Issue), Economy (Performance Issue), Social class and group relationships (Democratic Issue), Foreign affairs (Performance Issue.), Government functioning (performance issue.), Taxes (Republican issue) and Energy problem, Fuel Shortages, and Energy policies (Democratic issue). The top five issues that were covered by the Republican candidates however are: Foreign affairs (performance issues.), Taxes (Republican issue), Moral values (Republican issues), Big government (Republican issues) and the Economy (performance issue)."
2009-1917,YouTube and Media Literacy: Testing the Effectiveness of YouTube Media Literacy Campaigns About Body Image Targeted Toward Adolescent Girls and College Women,formation Technology and Media Literacy in the Classroom,,,,Paper,YouTube and Media Literacy: Testing the Effectiveness of YouTube Media Literacy Campaigns About Body Image Targeted Toward Adolescent Girls and College Women,Information Technology and Media Literacy in the Classroom,"Research examining the social effects of mass media as it relates to body image distortion often considers some behavioral components, specifically excessive dieting, bingeing, and exercising, but little is known about the degree in which more positive media messages, specifically campaigns designed to promote positive attitudes and beliefs about body shape and size will effect the self and others. Using an experiment to test the effectiveness of four different media literacy campaigns on YouTube, this study tested the effectiveness of four stylistically different media literacy campaigns about body image and tested the possible factors that might increase or decrease the perceived effectiveness of each. Respondents in this study reported that the media literacy campaign about a celebritys struggle with extreme thinness proved to be the least effective of the four whereas the video presenting general information about the dangers of extreme dieting was perceived to be the most effective, at least for this sample. Self-discrepancy did not prove to be a significant predictor of perceived effectiveness of the campaign, and the amount of time spent on the Internet also proved to be a weak predictor of perceived effectiveness. These findings and the possible rationale for the lack of support with regard to the correlates of perceived effectiveness are discussed."

Cuna de lobos was produced in 1986 and broadcasted again in 2008 as a telenovela adaptation of the original series of Mexican play writer Carlos Olmos. From a zoosemiotics perspective, it is possible to analyze (a) the zoophobic title of this telenovela and the animal drives involved in the development of characters; (b) the reptilian stimuli used in the narrative and directed to the viewer, which played a main role in this telenovelas wide reception phenomenon; and (c) the inclusion of narrative strategies taken from the thriller (suspense) and the farce, which have been innovative for this televisual genre in Mexico."
