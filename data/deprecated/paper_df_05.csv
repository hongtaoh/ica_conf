2005-1,A Beard and a Pasty Forehead: Collective Memory of the First Kennedy-Nixon Debate,Campaign Communications: A Look at the Old and the New,Political Communication,,,Paper,A Beard and a Pasty Forehead: Collective Memory of the First Kennedy-Nixon Debate,Campaign Communications: A Look at the Old and the New,"The Great Debates between Senator John Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon were unprecedented. The prevailing history of the decisive first debate on September 26, 1960, holds that Kennedy prevailed, in large part due to Nixons dismal appearance on the television screen. To demonstrate that the visual elements were decisive, commentators often refer to sample surveys or polls conducted after the debate. According to these accounts, television viewers who had seen the debate thought Kennedy the winner, whereas radio listeners who listened to the debate thought Nixon had prevailed. While the actual empirical evidence supporting this claim is thin, the viewer-listener story has been told so many times that is has become an accepted part of American political lore. This paper, an analysis of 567 articles appearing in the New York Times since September 1960, charts the collective memory of this seminal political event. Through a content analysis of these stories, the paper argues that the dominant account of the decisive first debate has gradually evolved from a narrative that highlighted the qualities of presidential leadership into a narrative stressing the importance of personal appearance. In the process, the 1960 presidential debates have been recast to service the broader claim that image inevitably triumphs over substance in political campaigns."
2005-51,Actual Self and Ideal Brand Image: An Application of Self-congruity to Brand Image Positioning,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,Information Systems,,,Paper,Actual Self and Ideal Brand Image: An Application of Self-congruity to Brand Image Positioning,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,"The overriding purpose for this paper was to investigate brand image positioning of ten existing and most popular perfume/cologne brands among a young consumer market represented by a college student sample in relation to self-congruity (e.g. actual self image vs. ideal brand image). Our findings indicate significant personality characteristics valued by young consumer market (i.e. trendy and wholesome). This market has healthy self-concept, which was made salient by having self image and ideal brand image positioned in the same optimal region of positioning. Successful brands among this market are those manage to project the congruent personality images as desired by the young consumer market. Significant managerial implications for advertising practitioners and brand managers are also included."
2005-101,Analyzing Talk of Intimates: The Real and Reel-Life Couples Communication Styles,"Language, Meaning, and Understanding",Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Analyzing Talk of Intimates: The Real and Reel-Life Couples Communication Styles,"Language, Meaning, and Understanding","The study is an exploratory research on intimate talk and an attempt at analyzing real and reel couples. It aimed to investigate the characteristics of and to provide a comparison of real Filipino (married couples) and reel (Filipino couples in romance novels) couples. The study found out that the structure and linguistic (e.g., grammatical, syntactic and semantic style) of the dialogues between real and reel couples differed  real couples talk is oralin nature  e.g., with shorter words in a sentence, while reel couples in the novels talk the way the writers wanted them to express -- in more narrative, lengthier, repetitive style for emphasis and reinforcement of their thoughts and ideas in the readers minds

Using Miller, et al.s communication styles framework, a general trend has been found that style 1, followed by style 3 then by style 2 is what characterizes talk between reel and real couples. This somewhat indicates that talk in romance novels parallel the style of talk in real-life situations.

In terms of the content of the talk, the study found that both real and reel couples talked about topic messages more than relationship-messages (relationship-messages were least of all the message types for both real and reel couples). This brings to mind that perhaps both in real and reel life, there is more to intimate talk than talking about intimate or very private matters.

One feature common to most reality television programs is direct address, where characters on the program gaze directly into the camera and, in essence, speak directly to the viewer at home. Previous research has shown that the use of this feature in other programming genres has the ability to affect how viewers rate a program's content. Moreover, research has also shown that this feature has the potential to foster stronger parasocial bonds between viewers and the characters on screen. Using both self-report and psychophysiological measures, this study examines the effect of this feature on viewers' attention and emotional response to this feature."
2005-201,Beyond Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Internalized Extrinsic Motivation in the Promotion of Learning Among Primary School Students,Top Four Papers in Instructional Communication,Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,Beyond Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Internalized Extrinsic Motivation in the Promotion of Learning Among Primary School Students,Top Four Papers in Instructional Communication,"Motivating is essentially a communicative process. Researchers have previously attributed learning to either intrinsic or extrinsic motivations and provided teachers with many guidelines in promoting learning in school. However it is still widely documented that while children are highly interested in learning and intrinsically motivated when they enter primary school, their motivation in learning declined steadily from the 3rd grade to the 8th grade.

This paper critically examines the existing dialogue among theorists on the respective merits of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and identifies a set of causes of students declining interests in learning. More importantly, this paper points out the previously neglected concept of internalized motivation and proposes a longitudinal experiment to explore the effect of internalized motivation on learning."
2005-251,Characteristics and Motives of Adolescents Talking with Strangers on the Internet and its Consequences,"x, Lies, and Video Games: The Influence of Television, the Internet, and Video Games on Teens",Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,Characteristics and Motives of Adolescents Talking with Strangers on the Internet and its Consequences,"Sex, Lies, and Video Games: The Influence of Television, the Internet, and Video Games on Teens","Despite widespread concerns about the dangers of adolescents' online communication with strangers, we know little about (a) which types of adolescents talk with strangers; (b) what motivates them to do so; and (c) what consequences this has for romantic relationship formation. Drawing on a survey among 490 adolescents, we found a nonlinear age effect, indicating that early adolescents (12- to 14-year-olds) were most prone to talk with strangers on the Internet. In contrast to earlier research, introversion was not related to adolescents tendency to talk with strangers. The motives of entertainment, meeting new people, and social compensation increased adolescents' online communication with strangers. Adolescents online communication with strangers did not enhance their probability to establish online romantic relationships."
2005-301,Communication Patterns and Civic Life on the Internet in Korea,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,Political Communication,,,Paper,Communication Patterns and Civic Life on the Internet in Korea,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,"This study investigated the two relationships between communication patterns and civic virtues, and between civic virtues and political participation on the Internet. Unlike real world communication, the Internet space can reduce the influence of hierarchical communication structure and social prejudices on sex, income, or education. The anonymity on the Internet encourages freedom of expression and thoughts.
Through questionnaire survey conducted to Korean university students, the paper looked at the level of human expression and reception on the Internet. This study considered online writing as the human expression of speaking, and online reading as the human reception of listening. Based on the level of expression and reception on the Internet, this paper divided survey respondents into four groups.
The result of the survey showed that two groups with higher level of writing displayed more individuality, i.e. willingness to express. On the other hand, two other groups with higher level of reading manifested more civility, i.e. readiness to hear other people's opinions. However, the participation level on the Internet was higher in balanced two groups of writing and reading than other unbalanced groups.
The survey concluded that writing and reading on Internet is equally important to civic virtues. While writing, the expressive function of communication, is related with individual aspect, reading, the receptive function of communication, is related with communal aspect. People who exercised both writing and reading were more likely to be highly participating citizens on Internet."
2005-351,Cosmetic Surgery in Action: Communication Challenges for Plastic Surgeons,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,Language & Social Interaction,,,Paper,Cosmetic Surgery in Action: Communication Challenges for Plastic Surgeons,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,"This essay investigates the communication challenges that a plastic surgeon experienced in the course of an encounter with a 74-year-old woman seeking aesthetic surgery, including rhinoplasty and rhytidectomy. Right after coming out from this encounter, the plastic surgeon reported hat he had a very difficult time with the patient. What made this moment communicatively difficult and how these challenges were manifested in interaction is the analytical focus of this essay. Drawing upon a 60-minute videotaped encounter between the doctor and the patient as well as a 60-minute videotaped session with the cosmetic surgeon about this moment, the paper describes five communication challenges that the plastic surgeon faced in the interactional moment. They include: (a) grasping the patients reasons for the visit, (b) seeing what the patient sees, (c) being face-attentive when the body does not lie, (d) handling self-deprecating remarks, and (e) managing patient-initiated requests."
2005-401,Deliberative Learning: Processes and Effects of Civic Education,Top Four Papers in Instructional Communication,Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,Deliberative Learning: Processes and Effects of Civic Education,Top Four Papers in Instructional Communication,"This paper conducts an analysis of long-term influence of the Kids Voting curriculum as taught to high school students in Arizona, Colorado, and Florida. We test a model of adolescent development by applying the perspective of deliberative democracy to civic learning. We also explore the differential effects of curriculum components to identify the most consequential learning experiences. Data are derived from a panel study of student-parent dyads interviewed after the 2002 intervention and again one year later. Kids Votings immediate effects were systematic across multiple dimensions of media use and cognition, discussion, and opinions and behavior. One year later, curriculum effects persisted in news attention, issue salience, encouraging parents to pay attention to news, multiple dimensions of discussion, and partisan identification. In a majority of the indicators, the curriculum influence was actually stronger one year later, suggesting that Kids Voting prepares adolescents for long-term receptivity to political stimulation."
2005-451,Discord and Religious Identity: News Framing of Muslims in the Kashmir Conflict,Covering Conflict and Peace,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Discord and Religious Identity: News Framing of Muslims in the Kashmir Conflict,Covering Conflict and Peace,"For the past five decades (and more) the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been a territory of contention between India and Pakistan. The history of the conflict dates back to the period of British rule in the sub-continent and the consequent creation of India and Pakistan as separate national entities.
News media in India and Pakistan frame the conflict as a territorial dispute, and in terms of differential religious and political ideologies in India and Pakistan; media in both countries tend to reflect the hegemonic ideals of their ruling classes. The focus of the conflict has changed over the years in each of the above dimensions: the religious angle in particular is interesting given that both countries now have right wing governments whose ideologies are sometimes classified as fundamentalist.
This paper examines the conflict in Kashmir from a religious perspective. Given the growing popularity of a Hindutva ideology and increasing communal tensions within the country, the study asks how Muslims in Kashmir, Pakistan, and India are framed with regard to the conflict. Content analysis has been used to identify news framing patterns of Muslims. Results indicate that Indian newspapers do indeed focus more on Muslims than Hindus and that news frames of Muslims tend to be a lot more negative than positive. Implications of such framing patterns are discussed with regard to the nature of communal relations (between Hindus and Muslims) in India."
2005-501,"Effects of News Reports About Genetics and Obesity on Perceived Disease Controllability, Responsibility, and Helping Behavior","Health News Studies: Agenda Setting, Knowledge and Susceptibility",Health Communication,,,Paper,"Effects of News Reports About Genetics and Obesity on Perceived Disease Controllability, Responsibility, and Helping Behavior","Health News Studies: Agenda Setting, Knowledge and Susceptibility","This study tests the effects of three types of news reports that suggest different causes of obesity: genetic causes, behavioral causes, and complex causes of the disorder. Based on attributional theory, perceived controllability, responsibility of obesity, and helping behavior toward obese people were measured as outcome variables of the three different news types. In the genetic influence type news condition, participants read news articles that summarize genetic research findings that link genes as a cause of a disease (e.g., obesity). In the behavioral influence type news condition, subjects read news articles that report scientific research results that suggest behavior (e.g., exercise or diet) as a cause of the disease. Finally, in the complex type news condition, participants read news articles that were based on the genetic type news report yet had some additional information suggesting behavioral possibility. No significant main effects of the three news types were found. However, significant interaction between news types and audiences prior cognition (i.e., health control beliefs) on disease controllability, responsibility, and helping behavior were found. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are further discussed."
2005-551,"Examining the Roles of Self-Esteem and Identity Concerns in Decisions About, and Consequences of, Revealing Secrets",dentity and Impression Mangagement in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,"Examining the Roles of Self-Esteem and Identity Concerns in Decisions About, and Consequences of, Revealing Secrets",Identity and Impression Mangagement in Interpersonal Communication,"The present investigation followed 342 individuals who were keeping a secret over a two month period, focusing on the rumination often involved in secrecy. Rumination at the beginning of the study was associated negatively with self-esteem and positively with perceptions that the secret was relevant to ones identity and concerns about managing ones impression on the target. High rumination, in turn, predicted revelation of ones secret. Among individuals who revealed their secret, the extent to which rumination declined was inversely related to the perceived negativity of the targets response, and increases in self-esteem were associated with the extent to which revealers viewed the secret as less relevant to their identity over time."
2005-601,Flexing Their Political Muscle: Newspaper Coverage of Jesse Ventura's and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Gubernatorial Campaigns,News Coverage of Politics,Political Communication,,,Paper,Flexing Their Political Muscle: Newspaper Coverage of Jesse Ventura's and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Gubernatorial Campaigns,News Coverage of Politics,"This study examined the role of the press as a link between celebrity political candidates and their local citizenry. It compared coverage of Jesse The Body Ventura in the Minneapolis Star Tribune to that of Arnold The Terminator Schwarzenegger in the Los Angeles Times. The Times highlighted Schwarzeneggers celebrity status more than twice as often as the Star Tribune showcased Venturas. The Times also focused on Schwarzeneggers image, while the Star Tribune featured Venturas issue stances."
2005-651,"Gentlemen, Start Your Ideologies: NASCAR Telecasts and New Right Ideology","ports, Sociability, and Power in Popular Communication",Popular Communication,,,Paper,"Gentlemen, Start Your Ideologies: NASCAR Telecasts and New Right Ideology","Sports, Sociability, and Power in Popular Communication","NASCAR has emerged from its status as a largely regional phenomenon to become the second largest spectator sport in the United States. This paper analyzes NASCAR television events as ritual celebrations of a distinct ideology. The paper traces NASCARs development within the socio-cultural milieu of the mid-to-late 20th-century American South. Prerace coverage is treated as a prime opportunity to encode race events within a mythological discourse. It is argued that prerace telecasts seek to discursively construct NASCAR events as ritual celebrations of laissez-faire economics, ultra-conservative cultural values, and fervent nationalism."
2005-701,How an Issue in Cyberspace Shifts to the Real World: Three-Stage Cyber-Issue Diffusion (CID) Model,and Activist Groups in Public Relations,Public Relations,,,Paper,How an Issue in Cyberspace Shifts to the Real World: Three-Stage Cyber-Issue Diffusion (CID) Model,Issues and Activist Groups in Public Relations,"This study identifies the characteristics of communication in cyberspace, in particular, how an issue is formed, diffused and amplified to the extent that it arouses collective action in the off-line world. The degree of influence was tested by ten media types and by three issue stages. Qualifications of how an issue shifted from being a cyber issue to off-line action was suggested and tested. In particular, a Three-Stage Cyber-Issue Diffusion (CID) Model was proposed that identifies an issue cycle in cyberspace as a forming stage, a diffusion stage and an action stage. Through factor analysis, the type of media was categorized into three groups such as off-line mass media group, individual media group and Internet homepage group."
2005-751,Impacts of Website Context Relevance on Banner Advertisement Effectiveness,Understanding Internet Advertisement,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Impacts of Website Context Relevance on Banner Advertisement Effectiveness,Understanding Internet Advertisement,"This study examines how Internet context (web site) within which advertisements (banners) are embedded influences the ad effectiveness, considering contextual relationship between web sites and banners. Respondents evaluated banners after they reviewed a web site in which a contextually relevant banner and a contextually irrelevant banner were placed. Results suggest that (1) a contextually relevant banner induced more favorable evaluation and a greater purchase intention toward advertised products than a contextually irrelevant counterpart, and (2) neither a contextually relevant banner nor a contextually irrelevant banner was recalled better than the other banner. These findings provide implications for future consumer research and the development of advertisements on the Internet"
2005-801,Internet Press Freedom and Online Crisis Reporting: The Role of News Sites in SARS Epidemic,The Online Challenge to the News,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Internet Press Freedom and Online Crisis Reporting: The Role of News Sites in SARS Epidemic,The Online Challenge to the News,"This paper examines the role that was played by news Web sites in two regions with different degrees of Internet press freedom in the SARS crisis. Six online news sites in Hong Kong and mainland China were selected for investigation. The findings indicate that the news sites in Hong Kong, which enjoy a high degree of Internet press freedom, acted as interactive crisis managers, and contributed in a number of ways to the management of the SARS crisis in the community. On the contrary, the news sites in the mainland China, which are restricted by media censorship, served as governments online agent of containment. The findings show that news sites were able to offer efficient warnings, timely education, and a network of support during the crisis because of the unique characteristics of the Internet medium. However, due to the constraints on Internet press freedom, the Chinese sites were unable to take full advantage of the Internet medium to play a positive role in the management of the crisis."
2005-851,"Journalism as a Vocation: Liang Qichao and the Contested Ideas of Journalism, 1890s-1900s","ternational & Development Subdivision, Intercultural & Development Division Interactive Paper Session",Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,"Journalism as a Vocation: Liang Qichao and the Contested Ideas of Journalism, 1890s-1900s","International & Development Subdivision, Intercultural & Development Division Interactive Paper Session","The journalistic scene in the late Qing (1890s-1900s) was heterogeneous and sometimes strife-ridden, divided by competing ideological traditions and polarized by political powers. This study focuses on analyzing Liang Qichaos views on journalism. Departs from previous scholarship that either focuses on exploring the links between Liangs journalistic notion and that of Habermass of a century later or attempts to determine the roots of Liangs journalistic ideal in Mencius and other Confucian traditions that were nurtured centuries before, this study seeks to shift scholarly attention to the immediate context in which Liangs idea of journalism was proposed and contested. Seeing Liangs journalistic ideal as a historically specific formulationproduct of and response to the complex dynamics among competing discourses of his own time  this study is an attempt to provide a more complete picture of the discursive construction of Chinese journalism in the end of the nineteenth century. It also asks the important question of why Liangs notion of journalism became the dominant discourse in the late nineteenth century and has remained influential in China throughout the twentieth century."
2005-901,"Loneliness, Perceived Reality and Parasocial Interaction",Explorations in Parasocial Relationships,Mass Communication,,,Paper,"Loneliness, Perceived Reality and Parasocial Interaction",Explorations in Parasocial Relationships,"This study examines the influence of personal (sociability and loneliness) and content (perceived reality) characteristics on peoples social interaction and parasocial interaction (the interaction with characters in media). After a comprehensive literature review, 4 hypotheses are proposed on loneliness, social interaction and parasocial interaction, and perceived reality. The survey method is used, and all of the measurements (except for social interaction) in the questionnaire have been reliably used in a wide range of social science research. Our results suggest that loneliness and parasocial interaction are not associated with the discrepancy between sociability and social interaction. The extent of loneliness exerts no influence on the association between social and parasocial interaction. Perceived reality is positively correlated with parasocial interaction."
2005-951,Media Coverage of Ghanaian Women in Pre- and Post-Kufuor Election Period,"ternational & Development Subdivision, Intercultural & Development Division Interactive Paper Session",Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Media Coverage of Ghanaian Women in Pre- and Post-Kufuor Election Period,"International & Development Subdivision, Intercultural & Development Division Interactive Paper Session","Issues affecting Ghanaian women gained prominence in the 2000 presidential electioneering campaign, leading to the creation of various political structures to address them. These new structures are expected to affect the medias coverage of women and womens issues. An examination of the media in the pre- and post-Kufuor election period revealed that coverage of women has not changed. However, findings indicate that the media is creating a class structure with its coverage of women within the various social classes."
2005-1001,Militarized Femininity and the Nation: Mediating the Jessica Lynch Story,Women and the News,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,Militarized Femininity and the Nation: Mediating the Jessica Lynch Story,Women and the News,"American national media coverage of women and war must be situated within an investigation of the gendered politics of American military manpower, its relation to patriotism, patriarchy, Western progress and the gendered discourses adopted by the U.S. media to frame war as a (white) male endeavor. This project explores the way that the story of Jessica Lynch provides for a powerful space on which to map cultural and political narratives about gender and war. In tracing the symbolic and ideological use of the figure of the female soldier embodied by Jessica Lynch by national media discourses I propose that the female soldier becomes a sight for the constitution of a series of normative paradoxes, but also a point of entry for the debates about women and war. The story of Jessica Lynch is about contradictions to the core of normative narratives of war and gender. Indeed, the nations investment in Jessica Lynch is about the celebration of a potentially disruptive kind of femininity; it is about the celebration of an American female soldier. At the same time, the media interpreted the events surrounding Lynchs capture and rescue in such a way that would uphold masculinitys centrality to the war system by explicitly containing her militarized femininity."
2005-1051,News Cues: Do Indicators of Newsworthiness by Newsbots Affect our Perception of News Stories?,"Top Eight Papers in Communication and Technology, Part 1",Communication and Technology,,,Paper,News Cues: Do Indicators of Newsworthiness by Newsbots Affect our Perception of News Stories?,"Top Eight Papers in Communication and Technology, Part 1","Google News and other newsbots have automated the process of news selection, providing online users with a virtually limitless array of news and public information, dynamically culled from thousands of news organizations all over the world. News leads are typically accompanied by three cuesthe name of the primary source from which the headline and lead were borrowed, the time elapsed since the story broke, and the number of related articles written about this story by other news organizations tracked by the newsbot. This paper investigates the psychological significance of these cues by positing that each cue triggers a distinct heuristic (mental shortcut) that tends to influence online users perceptions of a given news item. A large 2x3x6 within-subjects online experiment (N = 523) systematically varied two levels of the source-credibility cue, three levels of the upload-recency cue and six levels of the number-of-related-articles cue in an effort to investigate their effects upon perceived message credibility, newsworthiness and likelihood of clicking on the news lead. Results showed evidence for source primacy effect, and some indication of a cue-cumulation effect when source credibility is low. Findings are discussed in the context of machine and bandwagon heuristics."
2005-1101,Organizational Media Selection and Use: A Comparison and Synthesis of Communicational Approaches,"Knowledge Management, Organizational Media, and Communication Technology",Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Organizational Media Selection and Use: A Comparison and Synthesis of Communicational Approaches,"Knowledge Management, Organizational Media, and Communication Technology","The goal of this paper is to compare and contrast how different organizational communication theorists/researchers would answer the question: Do organizational members choose the media they use? Specifically, four different lines of theory and associated research strategies on organizational communication and media are considered, namely, James Taylor and colleagues, Janet Fulk and colleagues, Noshir Contractor/Monge and colleagues, and Marshall Scott Pool and colleagues. The common themes and differences among these approaches and the implications for developing theory and research strategies to successfully investigate and explain media selection and usage within organizations are discussed."
2005-1151,Play it Again Uncle Sam: Ritual and Imagination in American Dreams,Hopes and Dreams and Imagined Themes,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Play it Again Uncle Sam: Ritual and Imagination in American Dreams,Hopes and Dreams and Imagined Themes,"This paper examines the television show American Dreams. Through semiotic, textual, and narrative analysis, paired with what producers have said about the show, I argue that the show serves a nation-building function. Set in Philadelphia in the 1960s, the show focuses on the six-member Pryor family, the audience is meant to see the family as their prior American selves. Meg, the eldest daughter embodies the future of the nation. Just as Meg is eager and forward-looking, with a face so smooth and glowing it couldnt be any easier to look at, the history presented on American Dreams is infinitely digestible, relating well-known events as simply as possible, inserting pop songs from the era into the narrative to orient viewers to the emotions they should be feeling, and making use of authentic news and television footage to add authenticity and a sense of realness to the stories that are told. American Dreams, by playing retro media, using the audiences knowledge of how it all ends, and sympathetically portraying multiple perspectives, imagines a nation unified by history and emotion. The retelling of history on American Dreams serves a nation-building function; it is a retelling of a shared past that revisits tensions only to resolve them, letting viewers imagine not only a better America, but also an America in which they are members. This show, which premiered a year after the terrorist attacks of September 11, offers support to the American public by suggesting that Americas current state of anxiety is natural and tolerable."
2005-1201,Privacy and Smart Cards: Hong Kong and Ontario,Theorizing Technologys Impact on Communication and Policy,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,Privacy and Smart Cards: Hong Kong and Ontario,Theorizing Technologys Impact on Communication and Policy,"This article examines the notion of privacy as it is conceptualized and implemented as a constitutive element of identity in two different milieux: Hong Kong (a Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China), and Ontario (Canada). We argue that in addition to institutional structures that differ between the two jurisdictions of Hong Kong and Ontario, differing cultural notions of privacy tend to affect the acceptance of new information and communication technologies (ICTs). For our comparison, we focus on one potentially privacy-invasive technology, smart cards, and discuss the factors that contribute to their adoption and use in the two regions selected, including ones conceptualization of digital identity and privacy, and the role of consultation and public debate."
2005-1251,"Redefining ""Local"" in Radio News: The Impact of Consolidation on Coverage","Profit, Convergence, Ownership: Corporate Issues in News Production",Mass Communication,Journalism Studies,,Paper,"Redefining ""Local"" in Radio News: The Impact of Consolidation on Coverage","Profit, Convergence, Ownership: Corporate Issues in News Production","Consolidation of ownership has been a defining characteristic in local radio, particularly since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While changes in format consolidation and general programming have been well-documented, the implications for local radio news have not been studied as extensively. This paper utilizes data from field research in a small radio market to examine issues related to news values and decision-making when such choices are taken out of a local context. It compares the content of news produced in that local market to newscasts produced for that city from a corporate newsroom almost 300 miles away. Broader issues about the meaning of news in a community are also examined in the context of cultural geography and sense of place literature."
2005-1301,"Risk, Issues and Precaution in Late Modernity: Sustainable Public Relations on a Global Scale.",Public Health Crisis Response,Public Relations,,,Paper,"Risk, Issues and Precaution in Late Modernity: Sustainable Public Relations on a Global Scale.",Public Health Crisis Response,"Using the issue of climate change as an example, this paper aligns the public relations concept of issues management with the environmental management concept of risk. Both of these concepts advise a proactive approach. However, by drawing on Ulrich Becks concept of the risk society, we see that risks are discursively constructed and contested. At stake is the perception of legitimacy of risk or issue management strategies by stakeholders. Through analysis of submissions made to the New Zealand Government on climate change, we explore the utilisation of discourses by which companies and business associations in New Zealand attempt to influence public policy and legitimate their handling of the global risk."
2005-1351,Sex Versus Gender: Questioning the Dialogue,Theorizing the Feminine,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,Sex Versus Gender: Questioning the Dialogue,Theorizing the Feminine,"In teaching a course in Gender and Communication I became interested in understanding the complexities of the divide between what has been labeled sex and what we call gender. Following along with the textbooks, I gave the biological conceptualization of sex brief mention and quickly moved on to gender, the social and cultural constructions. Yet, I wanted to know more about the complexities of sex. How do we actually define sex? Why have we split sex from gender? In what ways are we better off from splitting the two concepts? In what ways have we suffered? Can we participate in the sex dialogue without oppressing women? Can we find ways to include communication scholars in the important dialogue of integrating sex and gende? With the introduction of biological and evolutionary perspectives of communication into our curriculum, I believe these are important questions to ask. I believe this pursuit of understanding the sex/gender divide will lead us toward the development of a progressive, integrative sex/gender communication theory and place communication scholars into a dialogue already in progress in multiple disciplines. In this paper, I explore the complexities of sex."
2005-1401,Still the Middle Way. A Study of Political Communication Practices in Swedish Election Campaigns.,Political Communication Around the World: Developing Models and Assessing Realities,Political Communication,,,Paper,Still the Middle Way. A Study of Political Communication Practices in Swedish Election Campaigns.,Political Communication Around the World: Developing Models and Assessing Realities,"This paper focuses on the process of hybridization of political campaigns, using Sweden as a case study, and raises three main research questions. Firstly, how do global campaign practices influence the national campaign context in Sweden? Secondly, how does Swedish political structure and political culture influence the adaptation of global trends in this area? Thirdly, how can a possible hybridization of political campaigning be characterized in Sweden?
The data in this study is mainly based on structured interviews with Party Secretaries and Campaign Officials in all seven parties with seats in the Swedish Parliament.
The results of the study indicate that the hybridization of political communication practices in Sweden is characterized by a growing use of global campaign practices. Marketing tools are frequently used for opinion analyses, but there are substantial obstacles for a complete implementation of modern practices. To some extent this can be explained by existing laws and regulations, but above all, by public perceptions of parties, politics and elections. Sweden is a country with a structural framework where global campaign features can be transformed to a large extent. However, a political culture more influenced by a national campaign context somewhat curtails this transformation process."
2005-1451,Television Activity Among African Americans: Is it Related to Perceptions of Outgroup Vitality?,cial Identity Processes in Intergroup Communication,Intergroup Communication,,,Paper,Television Activity Among African Americans: Is it Related to Perceptions of Outgroup Vitality?,Social Identity Processes in Intergroup Communication,"The present study continues the trend toward investigating the relationship between mass media and intergroup relations that has been developing over the last few years. Research and data have emerged, which indicate media use is related to ingroup perceptions of the intergroup context. However, little is known about the relationship between media and outgroups perceptions of the intergroup context. The current study attempts to advance this line of research by investigating the relationship between African Americans media activity and their perceptions of Caucasian and Hispanic vitality. Two hypotheses are offered based on Cultivation Theory, and a set of research questions are asked based on the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach. Results indicate the U&G approach is more robust than Cultivation Theory in predicting African Americans vitality perceptions of Caucasian and Hispanic vitality."
2005-1501,The Construction of Work in Online Career Sites of Fortune 500 Companies,Anticipatory Socialization and Recruitment,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,The Construction of Work in Online Career Sites of Fortune 500 Companies,Anticipatory Socialization and Recruitment,"Corporate recruitment efforts have evolved from traditional newspaper want ads to highly-sophisticated, rhetorically powerful recruiting Web sites or career sites. Career sites represent a unique aspect of organizational communication because they capture not only an organizations persuasive attempts to recruit potential applicants, but also contemporary beliefs about meanings of work. Using quantitative and qualitative content analysis of randomly selected Web sites from the 2004 Fortune 500 list, the authors found that most Fortune 500 companies focus on content that introduces the company and its positions, and attempts to sell the company as an employer. The persuasive movements employed on career sites include sketching the companys values, objectives, and credentials, building a case for the company as an employer of choice, sampling the workplace, and enabling the job search and application process. The representations of work displayed on career sites depict work as career-building, workers as agents, and employers as benefactors. These representations are critiqued in context of current reports on working conditions as well as Marxist critical theory."
2005-1551,The Emotional Life of the News: a Mediational Perspective on News Consumption and its Relevance for Political Communication,formation Processing: How We Come to Understand the World Around Us,Political Communication,,,Paper,The Emotional Life of the News: a Mediational Perspective on News Consumption and its Relevance for Political Communication,Information Processing: How We Come to Understand the World Around Us,"This paper examines a somewhat neglected  yet central  aspect of news consumption, that of emotions. Although the news is one of the most studied television genres, most traditional approaches rarely depart significantly from an  often unwitting  normative view (Schudson, 2000: 194). The paper is based on the premise that audiences engagement (or disengagement) with the news and politics involves both rational and affective elements. Drawing on original ethnographic work with British audiences the paper explores the emotional dimension of news consumption and discusses how it is relevant in the wider processes of engagement and participation in public life. The paper explores feelings and themes such as addiction, reassurance, shame, anxiety, pride, ambivalence, disappointment and anger and observes how audiences, through the news, connect (or not) to the wider narratives that have become the fabric of our world. The paper points to the power of the news and how much it is taken for granted even by those who are critical towards its content. Crucially, the paper has argued that the affective dimension of news consumption can cast light on the wider process of citizens engagement with politics and public life. News as a narrative is the means through which people connect to the world. But also, for some informants news has been a source of disappointment and anger and a catalyst for withdrawal from public life."

The purpose of this research is to determine how the Israeli peace movement has been covered in the US press, and in so doing, to gain a clearer understanding of the complex relationship between movements and media over time and, more specifically, the types and effectiveness of the frames utilized by both sides in order to explain the complicated peace process in the Middle East to American readers. The results that emerged from the study suggest that the Israeli peace movement has successfully managed to legitimate itself as a mainstream force in press coverage of the region and has carved out a niche for itself as a reliable source of information on illegal settlements in the Occupied Territories, which provides it with an expert entry point within media coverage of the peace process. Study results also suggest that the peace movement has regularly been framed as on the verge of collapse and whose existence and struggles are evidence of the deep divisions within Israeli society. As a result, many newspaper articles negatively framed peace movement efforts as futile and contributing to dangerous polarizations in Israel. Often, however, many of the articles depicting these internal tensions, placed blame on the Palestinians for failing to negotiate in good faith or curtail violence. In this sense, the Israeli peace movement was regularly framed as victims of Palestinian betrayals of their misguided hopes for peace."
2005-1651,The Portrayals of Minority Characters in Entertaining Animated Children's Programs,Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,Popular Communication,,,Paper,The Portrayals of Minority Characters in Entertaining Animated Children's Programs,Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,"The purpose of this study is to note, categorize, and discuss the stereotypes of African Americans in animated childrens cartoons. The purpose is also to compare them to see how they changed.
A quantitative analysis of 76 cartoons found that The Proud Family, a cartoon of the 21st century, is more stereotypical than Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, a cartoon from 30 years ago. Characters in Fat Albert are most often aggressive, intelligent, and witty. Characters in The Proud Family are most often jovial, aggressive, and intelligent. Though primary characters display the same amount of stereotypical behavior, secondary characters show an increase in the amount of stereotypical behavior.
This study extends the amount of research in the entertainment media field by focusing upon animated childrens cartoons. This approach will add to our understanding of stereotypes and the manner in which they are presented to audiences."
2005-1701,The Sequencing of Two Communication Models within Change: An Empirical Comparison of Two Organizations,Communication and Organizational Change,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,The Sequencing of Two Communication Models within Change: An Empirical Comparison of Two Organizations,Communication and Organizational Change,"The on-going and unremitting nature of new product development, shifting consumer and stakeholder priorities, and government reform create intense pressure for public sector organizations to commercialize, and for private sector organizations to be flexible (Zorn, Page & Cheney, 2000). Whilst most change processes are based on Lewins (1952) unfreeze-change-refreeze concept, the pressure faced by the public and private sectors to change continuously renders the Lewinian three step change models obsolete as time to refreeze is a rare commodity. This study investigates the communicative processes of change to address the identified knowledge gap in understanding the role, import and effect of communication in a continuous change environment. Using data from two longitudinal empirical studies, we extend Van de Ven and Pooles (1995) typology of change theories to accommodate the sequencing of two change communication models; monologic and dialogic change communication. The findings suggest that the sequencing of the two change communication models is informed by individual competencies and group expectations. Future research must consider the issues associated with sustaining and embedding of the communicative sequences in organizational change in order to avoid organizations being reliant on exceptional managers."
2005-1751,Towards Conceptualizing Suspension of Disbelief for Communication Research,Mass Communication High Density Session,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Towards Conceptualizing Suspension of Disbelief for Communication Research,Mass Communication High Density Session,"Suspension of disbelief is widely understood to be the tolerance of media users towards unreal or implausible content in fictional media. Although this concept and the phenomena behind it have been generally accepted, there is no precise definition of the corresponding activities of media users which could be utilized in order to test the construct empirically. Having introduced Suspension of Disbelief on the basis of its historical use as a nonmediation phenomenon and taking into account research on perceived reality and considerations about the distinction between reality and fiction Suspension of Disbelief is defined as a mode of media usage during which the recipient does not scrutinize plot consistency and realism of fiction media content nor does he or she pay attention to corresponding fractions and violations. Finally, the relevance of Suspension of Disbelief for research in communication science will be discussed."

In order to better understand this issue, this paper will document the wider HIV/AIDS situation in China, paying particular attention to the ways in which China has been criticized by the international community for its treatment of the epidemic. A human rights framework allows for a careful analysis of the epidemic which takes into account the disproportionate way that HIV/AIDS affects marginalized groups around the world, and in the Xinjiang context as one which overwhelmingly affects the Uighur minority. Further, a feminist-inspired human rights framework provides an entry into gender-specific analyses of the epidemic. In a human rights approach to HIV/AIDS programming communication is understood to be both a right and a means to claiming other rights. As free communication is limited in totalitarian China, a human rights approach would open spaces within which communication would be possible, while paying particular attention to the gendered realities of HIV/AIDS."

Scenes featuring teenagers were found to be more likely to feature pop music, and shows with more popular cultural references had more references to music."
2005-1901,Youre Nobody til Somebody Loves You: Seeking Esteem and Commitment Through Manipulation,dentity and Impression Mangagement in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Youre Nobody til Somebody Loves You: Seeking Esteem and Commitment Through Manipulation,Identity and Impression Mangagement in Interpersonal Communication,"While many factors influence individuals decision to remain in a relationship, identity is at the core of the evaluative process. Self-esteem is a filter through which individuals investments, satisfaction, and quality of alternatives in a romantic relationship are evaluated. This study tests the hypotheses that: (1) self-esteem is positively related to relational commitment independent of relational satisfaction, (2) self-esteem is negatively related to the endorsement of communicative and manipulative strategies to gain affirmation and commitment from partners, and (3) sex differences exist among the degree of self-esteem and the types of communicative strategies endorsed. A survey of 367 students from a large southwestern public university provided support for a multivariate model explaining identitys influence on relational value with the use of manipulation strategies. Furthermore, this study found that low self-esteem individuals are more likely to use negative types of manipulation that exclude the partner but include rivals. When individuals perceive low quality alternatives, they have a greater tendency to use jealousy induction. In short, low self-esteem individuals are more likely to endorse manipulation, thereby changing the partners behaviors to meet their relational expectations and desires. As the partner behaves in ways that fulfill the individuals expectations, the individuals commitment, satisfaction, and overall relational value increase."
