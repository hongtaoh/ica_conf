2005-0001,A Beard and a Pasty Forehead: Collective Memory of the First Kennedy-Nixon Debate,Campaign Communications: A Look at the Old and the New,Political Communication,,,Paper,A Beard and a Pasty Forehead: Collective Memory of the First Kennedy-Nixon Debate,Campaign Communications: A Look at the Old and the New,"The Great Debates between Senator John Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon were unprecedented. The prevailing history of the decisive first debate on September 26, 1960, holds that Kennedy prevailed, in large part due to Nixons dismal appearance on the television screen. To demonstrate that the visual elements were decisive, commentators often refer to sample surveys or polls conducted after the debate. According to these accounts, television viewers who had seen the debate thought Kennedy the winner, whereas radio listeners who listened to the debate thought Nixon had prevailed. While the actual empirical evidence supporting this claim is thin, the viewer-listener story has been told so many times that is has become an accepted part of American political lore. This paper, an analysis of 567 articles appearing in the New York Times since September 1960, charts the collective memory of this seminal political event. Through a content analysis of these stories, the paper argues that the dominant account of the decisive first debate has gradually evolved from a narrative that highlighted the qualities of presidential leadership into a narrative stressing the importance of personal appearance. In the process, the 1960 presidential debates have been recast to service the broader claim that image inevitably triumphs over substance in political campaigns."
2005-0002,"Academic Stress, Supportive Communication, and Health",Dealing with Stress and Crises,Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,"Academic Stress, Supportive Communication, and Health",Dealing with Stress and Crises,"Academic stress is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and physical illness. The current study examined the capacity of supportive communication received from friends and family (emotional and informational) to buffer the influence of academic stress on health. College students (N = 739; 210 males, 516 females, 16 gender not reported) completed measures of academic stress, received supportive communication, and health (depression, anxiety, and physical illness). Results indicated that the association between academic stress and depression decreased as instrumental support increased. In addition, emotional support was negatively associated with depression across levels of academic stress. The findings are discussed with respect to alleviating negative health outcomes for individuals experiencing academic stress."
2005-0003,Acculturation in the Age of New Media,Emerging Trends in Sojourner Studies,Intercultural & Development Communication,,Intercultural Communication,Paper,Acculturation in the Age of New Media,Emerging Trends in Sojourner Studies,"Compared to the availability of the prevailing mass media environment of a host society, the availability of ethnic media is limited in most communities. That may prevent ethnic media from exercising influence. However, Internet, as a popular medium, has made all of the U.S. look like Silicon Valley. Internet can provide access to both host media and ethnic media on the same platform. If the use pattern of host internet media and ethnic internet media is similar to the traditional media use pattern in the Silicon Valley among Chinese immigrants, then it can be argued that internet acts as a hindrance to immigrants adaptation to a new culture. If the new pattern is different from the old one, then what is the new pattern and what is the influence of Internet media as a whole on cultural adaptation? This paper aims at addressing those questions."
2005-0004,A Chronicle of Tobaccos Very Active Recruitment of Gays and Lesbians,GLBT Marriage and Marketing: An Interactive Paper Session,"Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Studies",,,Paper,A Chronicle of Tobaccos Very Active Recruitment of Gays and Lesbians,GLBT Marriage and Marketing: An Interactive Paper Session,"The tobacco industry has long been interested in selling cigarettes to members of the gay community. This is problematic, as gays and lesbians are more likely to smoke compared to the general population. Given that smoking is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths per year in the U. S. alone, there is growing concern over marketing cigarettes to people who are already smoking more than most. Yet as tobacco companies continue to grapple with strict anti-smoking laws as well as the publics increasingly negative attitude toward the industry itself as well as its products, they must find new ways to protect their profits. By examining tobacco companies internal documents culled from the tobacco archives now available to the public, this paper will show that tobacco industry giants have 1) aggressively gone after gay votes in their fight against anti-tobacco legislation, 2) worked to enhance their image with the gay community by supporting gay-friendly causes and sponsoring events popular with gays and lesbians, and 3) advertised in gay media."
2005-0005,A Cognition-Emotion Integrated Model of Media Message Processing,tructural Features and Cognitive Processing,Information Systems,,,Paper,A Cognition-Emotion Integrated Model of Media Message Processing,Structural Features and Cognitive Processing,"This paper proposes that researchers studying media processes and effects should incorporate an understanding of biological systems responsible for information processing in the human brain into theories of media message processing. By considering the emotional significance of any message feature being considered, the new model highlights the hierarchical integration of emotion and cognition in the brain and calls for understanding of the basic appetitive and defensive responses engaged during early sensory processing of message features."
2005-0006,A Comparison of Five Social Psychological Models of Condom Use: Implications for Designing Prevention Messages,Theoretical and Methodological Issues in Health Message Design,Health Communication,,,Paper,A Comparison of Five Social Psychological Models of Condom Use: Implications for Designing Prevention Messages,Theoretical and Methodological Issues in Health Message Design,"This investigation explored the condom-use intentions and behaviors of U.S. college students by comparing the predictive ability of five social psychological models: the theory of reasoned action; the theory of planned behavior; the self-efficacy theory; the health belief model; and the information-motivation-behavioral skills model. Three hundred fifteen sexually active male and female undergraduate students responded to a condom-use survey based on several theoretical constructs. The predictors consist of multi-item measures, including attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, HIV prevention information, HIV prevention motivation, and HIV prevention skills. Two criterion variables tested separately for each model are intentions to use condom and condom-use behaviors.
Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that (a) all five psychological models are significant in explaining condom use with different degrees of explained variance; (b) significant predictors of all models predicted intentions better than behaviors; and (c) the two sets of parallel variables most powerful in predicting intentions and behaviors are attitudes and perceived barriers, as well as self-efficacy and HIV prevention skills. In addition, perceived severity of illnesses is a possible predictor. These findings imply that a theory combining variables from several models may be the best. It suggests the need to scrutinize other theories that incorporate different potential variables, e.g. individual difference, environment, demographics, etc. Finally, the findings suggest that health campaigns targeting college students should develop prevention messages that center on three fundamental components: attitudes toward condoms, condom self-efficacy, and the perceptions of threat."
2005-0007,A Comparison of Pro-Anorexia and Treatment Web Sites: A Look at the Health Belief and Stages of Change Models Online,Challenges of Using Interactive Communication Technologies for Health I,Health Communication,,,Paper,A Comparison of Pro-Anorexia and Treatment Web Sites: A Look at the Health Belief and Stages of Change Models Online,Challenges of Using Interactive Communication Technologies for Health I,"The purpose of this study was to identify how health educators and eating disorder victims are using the Internet to communicate about anorexia nervosa. A systematically derived sample of 55 pro-anorexia and 71 treatment sites were content analyzed for use of theoretical constructs from the Health Belief and Stages of Change Models. Coders measured benefits of and barriers to recovery, self-efficacy for treatment and anorexia, and individual tailoring. As expected, results showed pro-anorexia sites were more likely to promote self-efficacy for anorexia. However, treatment sites also did so by containing common disease tips such as: fasting, diet drugs, purging, exercise, and hiding. Self-efficacy for treatment was available on both types of sites, but pro-ana sites discussion of health information was more comprehensive than expected: nearly one-third recommended nutrition and vitamins, 15% recommended psychotherapy, and 13% recommended group therapy. Both types of sites discussed common barriers to recovery, but few sites mentioned psychological barriers, such as identity loss, anger, emptiness, and vulnerability. This study demonstrates a model that health educators can use to assess the voices of anorexics on pro-anorexia web sites in order to improve the theoretical design and persuasive content of treatment sites."
2005-0008,"A Comparison of Public Policies and Research on Cultural Diversity in Mexican, Canadian and US Television","ternational & Development Subdivision, Intercultural & Development Division Interactive Paper Session",Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,"A Comparison of Public Policies and Research on Cultural Diversity in Mexican, Canadian and US Television","International & Development Subdivision, Intercultural & Development Division Interactive Paper Session","The issue of how to preserve and promote cultural diversity in Mexico, The United States and Canada has been central in policy debates and regulations within each country. How should governments proceed then to promote and maintain cultural diversity in a region closely integrated not just through economic trade but through the mass media? This paper reviews the current international debate on communication policies related to the promotion of cultural diversity through television. It starts with a discussion about what constitutes diversity in television, and follows with a review about the real impact of former media policies in the achievement of diversity. Using the concepts of source diversity, content diversity and exposure diversity, the paper analyzes the communication policies adopted or proposed in Mexico and compares them with current policies in Canada and the US. The paper concludes that current commercial strategies and goals both at the national and international level do not stimulate cultural diversity in media contents. It questions the utility of policies designed to regulate competition and ownership in the media with the objective of maximizing the number of outlets and emphasizing audience choice between these outlets. Instead, proposals which advocate a more mixed system of mass media with different mandates and different modes of financing are considered."
2005-0009,A Comparison of Three Models to Understand Purchasing Behavior of Avatar-Related Products,Avatars and Embodied Agents,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,A Comparison of Three Models to Understand Purchasing Behavior of Avatar-Related Products,Avatars and Embodied Agents,"This study focused on which theory best predicts the purchase of avatar-related products. Also, this research attempted to reveal a few factors that may contribute to the intention of undergraduate students purchasing behavior of avatar-related products. The Theory of Reasoned Action, the Theory of Planned Behavior, and the Technology Acceptance Model were compared to figure out which theory best explains the behavioral intention. This study used path model and hierarchical regressions to test if three models of behavioral intention work in explaining avatar-related product use. One hundred and eighty three undergraduate students who have used avatar-related products within the past one year were drawn from two universities in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The result showed that the TAM was superior to both the TRA and TPB for explaining variance in behavioral intention and in terms of model fit. TAM explained 26% of variance in behavioral intention and was consistent with the data. As expected, TRA explained the least variance in behavioral intention (23%) and the data did not fit the model. In the case of TPB, although this explained the most variance (28%) of the three models, the data did not fit the model."
2005-0010,"Acquiring Political Information on the Web: Issue Publics, Domain-Specificity, and Selectivity",formation Processing: How We Come to Understand the World Around Us,Political Communication,,,Paper,"Acquiring Political Information on the Web: Issue Publics, Domain-Specificity, and Selectivity",Information Processing: How We Come to Understand the World Around Us,"Using the combined data of individual survey and Web behavior records, this study explores issue publics' domain-specificity in cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral aspects and more importantly examines the underlying process by which issue publics develop domain-specific knowledge, attitude extremity, and issue voting. Overall, the results of this study confirmed that selectivity was the underlying process by which issue publics develop domain-specificity. Driven by personal issue importance, issue publics search for information in a highly selective manner, compared to the general public. This study also showed that high levels of selectivity had an advantage in acquisition of domain-specific knowledge. Overall patterns of the results suggested that issue publics appeared to take advantage of information selection on the Web more readily than did the general public. These results suggest a potential differential knowledge gain as well as a different kind of knowledge acquisition between issue publics and the general public. Issue publics tended to use candidate issue positions as a criterion for their voting decisions more often than did the general public. Moreover, the results of this study indicated that selective information gathering affected both perceived relative proximity (i.e., differentiation of whose position is closer to ones own) and extremity in candidate evaluations (i.e., differentiated feelings toward each candidate). As whole, the findings imply that acquiring information on the Web may facilitate sharper distinctions among issue publics domain-specificity. Implications for the functioning of democracy is discussed."
2005-0011,A Critical Analysis of EU Mobile Narratives and the Ideal Citizen of the Mobile World,"Politics, E-Government, and Technology, Part 2",Communication and Technology,,,Paper,A Critical Analysis of EU Mobile Narratives and the Ideal Citizen of the Mobile World,"Politics, E-Government, and Technology, Part 2","This paper compares and contrasts corporate and policy narratives of advanced cell phone use by the citizens-consumers of the European information society. It begins an exploration of the dominant discourses of mobile media technologies and looks to information society narratives in the European Union context for some preliminary answers. I applied methods of qualitative textual analysis to select European Commission policy documents and commercial mobile texts from the web sites of Europe-based cellular giants Nokia and Siemens. How do these distinct narratives understand the impact of 3G mobile services on human agency and interaction? Who are the mobile citizens of these narratives and what services are they framed as desiring? I argue that many mobile narratives amount to political visions for a networked society of citizen-consumer-laborers. They are often narrow and one-sided visions of what mobile and pervasive ICTs should be designed to do, and how, why, and under what circumstances groups of users, such as individuals, corporations, and governments can and should use them."
2005-0012,A Critical Review of Research on Cultural Similarities and Differences in Emotional Support,"Emotions, Social Support and Coping",Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,A Critical Review of Research on Cultural Similarities and Differences in Emotional Support,"Emotions, Social Support and Coping","The current paper reviews the available research evidence concerning cross-cultural similarities and differences in the processes through which people seek, provide, and respond to emotional support. This review indicates that emotional support is both a universal and culturally defined phenomenon. Members of different cultures seem to exhibit some fundamental similarities in what they seek from close relationships, in what they perceive as effective forms of emotional support, and in what they see as appropriate courses of action to take when providing support to distressed others. There are some equally important differences in the ways in which members of different cultures seek, provide, and respond to emotional support. Following a discussion of the implications and limitations of existing research, the paper also suggests some directions for future research."
2005-0013,A Critical Study of Representing Other: The Case of Media SARS Coverage on Vietnam and China,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,A Critical Study of Representing Other: The Case of Media SARS Coverage on Vietnam and China,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"Critical school thinking line in the concept of representing the other incurs certain degree of reductionism and essentialism. In some cases, it can be misused and even be viewed as an apologist proposition for those who exercise suppressive power to create false positive image of their home countries, such as the fallacy of the western media demonising China. By comparing the frames, themes and tones used to communicate China and Vietnams image by the mainstream western-led English press in five countries (i.e., U.S., U.K., Canada, Singapore, Australia) during the SARS crisis in 2003, this study re-examines one of the essential aspects of global journalistic dilemma in covering and depicting the other. Through a combination of empirical data and contextual analysis, the study attempts to show how and why the other receives international media treatment differently. Both internal forces and external factors, interplaying and often competing, have constituted the dynamic process of national images construction as a whole. These are important issues that are constantly unnoticed and untouched by contemporary established cultural studies."
2005-0014,A Critique of Active Audience Studies: The Audience as Political Participants in Alternative Media,Watching and Being Watched,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,A Critique of Active Audience Studies: The Audience as Political Participants in Alternative Media,Watching and Being Watched,"Active audience studies emphasize on the audiences ability to engage in oppositional decodings of media texts. However, this emphasis on audience competence not only privileges an active audience engaged in alternative or oppositional readings, but it also overlooks the fact that such audience decodings have rarely been channeled into producing progressive political ends. This paper criticizes active audience theories weakness in developing a means for assessing political effectiveness of audience resistance. The author suggests that the alternative media can encourage the audience to get involved in political life by providing information for action that functions as a comprehensive counterpoint to the mainstream media stories about politics and government."
2005-0015,A Cross-cultural Adaptation and Feminist Perspective of the Lives of Chinese F2s,Women Using Technology: From Cell Phones to On-line Dating,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,A Cross-cultural Adaptation and Feminist Perspective of the Lives of Chinese F2s,Women Using Technology: From Cell Phones to On-line Dating,"Employing cross-cultural adaptation and feminism perspective, this study applies participant observation method and examines the lives of Chinese F2s in the United States through analyzing the discourse of F1-F2 issues in the virtual community Family Board of the Unknown Space. The findings suggest that F2s depend completely on their spouses; F2s have to do all household chores; both F1s and F2s feel the pressure of adapting to a new place and culture; and it is even harder for a man to be an F2."
2005-0016,A Cross-Cultural Study of Grandmothers and Their Role Among Families in Taiwan and the United States,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,Language & Social Interaction,,,Paper,A Cross-Cultural Study of Grandmothers and Their Role Among Families in Taiwan and the United States,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,"The study investigates European American and Taiwanese grandmothers folk theories of their role, discipline, and advice giving. Adopting methods that privilege local meanings, we bring grandmothers voices into the conversation about childrearing, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural nuances in folk theories. In each cultural case, 16 grandmothers of 3-year-olds participated in in-depth interviews that were customized according to local communicative norms. While grandmothers in both contexts were engaged in similar tasks and perceived their role as distinct from that of mothers, their interpretations of these tasks differed. European American grandmothers saw their role as fun-seekers, or limited supporters; they did not see themselves as disciplinarians and found advice giving problematic. Taiwanese grandmothers saw themselves primarily as caregivers and moral guides; they readily disciplined misbehaving grandchildren and advised their daughters-in-law. Results contribute to the consensus that the grandmothers role is culture-specific leading to different understandings of the family unit."
2005-0017,Active Patient Participation: A Dialectical Perspective,Top Papers in Health Communication,Health Communication,,,Paper,Active Patient Participation: A Dialectical Perspective,Top Papers in Health Communication,"Building from the work that has been conducted in the area of active patient participation in healthcare encounters, this paper applies dialectical theory to Sharf, Haidet, & Kroll’s(in press) active patient continua. Relying on dialectical theory’s assumptions of complexity and contradiction, dialectical tensions of acceptance and denial and independence and dependence are described as being embedded in the active patient continua. Data for the analysis come from patients who were participants in four different but related studies at the Houston Center for Quality of Care and Utilization Studies. The struggle between acceptance and denial and between independence and dependence is a necessary and important component to the enactment of provider-patient partnership."
2005-0018,"Activism Revisited: Broadcasting, Culture, and the Public Relations of British NGOs",and Activist Groups in Public Relations,Public Relations,,,Paper,"Activism Revisited: Broadcasting, Culture, and the Public Relations of British NGOs",Issues and Activist Groups in Public Relations,"This paper explores broadcasting and cultural advocacy by British (including Scottish and Welsh) pressure groups operating as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on national, regional (European) and global platforms. One European group (EURALVA) was catalyzed by VLV, a core British group. These groups engagement with politicians and policy makers, which went beyond formal lobbying, represented a blurring of boundaries between public relations and politics. The majority of these informal and aspiring non-governmental organizations (NGOs) acted on behalf of their respective countries viewing, listening, and digital publics. Other groups, notably those in Scotland and Wales, pursued a broader cultural agenda. The study assessed how strategic relationship building, credible research, media education, and media advocacy were used in isolation and/or in tandem to effect policy and/or programming change. This combined approach reinforced the role of public relations in participatory democracy and the growth of a public sphere developed through the consensus of diverse groups for whom a voice in media content, cultural policies, and other compelling issues was paramount."
2005-0051,Actual Self and Ideal Brand Image: An Application of Self-congruity to Brand Image Positioning,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,Information Systems,,,Paper,Actual Self and Ideal Brand Image: An Application of Self-congruity to Brand Image Positioning,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,"The overriding purpose for this paper was to investigate brand image positioning of ten existing and most popular perfume/cologne brands among a young consumer market represented by a college student sample in relation to self-congruity (e.g. actual self image vs. ideal brand image). Our findings indicate significant personality characteristics valued by young consumer market (i.e. trendy and wholesome). This market has healthy self-concept, which was made salient by having self image and ideal brand image positioned in the same optimal region of positioning. Successful brands among this market are those manage to project the congruent personality images as desired by the young consumer market. Significant managerial implications for advertising practitioners and brand managers are also included."
2005-0052,Adaptation to Expressed Liking and Disliking in Initial Interactions: Nonverbal Involvement and Pleasantness Response Patterns,"Adaptation, Liking, and Dialectics",Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Adaptation to Expressed Liking and Disliking in Initial Interactions: Nonverbal Involvement and Pleasantness Response Patterns,"Adaptation, Liking, and Dialectics","This experiment applies interaction adaptation theory (IAT) to the tasks of examining individuals' needs, expectations, and goals for initial interactions and predicting their behavioral responses to nonverbal expressions of liking and disliking. Forty-eight adults interacted with participant confederates in an eight-minute problem-solving activity. Participants entered the interactions with moderately high goals for managing the conversation and eliciting positive feedback, and moderately strong expectations for relaxation and pleasantness. Several of these preinteraction goals and expectations predicted participants' initial conversational behaviors, as IAT hypothesizes. Halfway through the interaction, confederates were instructed to communicate nonverbal messages of liking or disliking. In line with IAT, participants largely reciprocated expressions of liking and compensated for expressions of disliking."
2005-0053,Additional Channels in Dutch Television Genres,Audience Research & Researching Audience,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Additional Channels in Dutch Television Genres,Audience Research & Researching Audience,"This study's central question is to what extent television genres in the Netherlands make use of additional channels and in what way these channels are incorporated into programs in terms of interactivity and genre objectives. In addition, we examine whether the availability of additional channels in genres corresponds to audience age. Expert interviews with representatives of Dutch broadcasting organizations and secondary analyses of Audience Research data were conducted. It was found that compared to other genres a) SMS is most frequently added to reality programs, b) email and websites to the information genre, c) teletext to sports programs, and d) merchandizing to childrens' programs. We found additional channels with hardly any influence on genre objectives, but also reinforcement of those objectives and additional channels contributing to the emergence of new genres. In addition, SMS is more often added to programs attracting a younger audience, whereas other additional channels are more often implemented in programs attracting an older than average audience. It was recommended that while implementing additional channels broadcasters should think beyond what is technically possible and feasible to offer to viewers, and pay attention to what typical viewers of genres may wish and in what way they make use of various channels (if at all)."
2005-0054,A Deeper Look at the Economics of Advertiser Support for Television: The Implications of Consumption-Differentiated Viewers and Ad Addressability,Media Economics & Planning,Mass Communication,,,Paper,A Deeper Look at the Economics of Advertiser Support for Television: The Implications of Consumption-Differentiated Viewers and Ad Addressability,Media Economics & Planning,"Commercial addressing technologies are currently being trialed that will make it possible to simultaneously deliver different ads to different viewers. Because the members of the audience for a given program often consume different products, addressable ads promise to substantially increase the revenue generated by television ad time. We present models of competitive television markets with addressable and nonaddressable ads and show that addressability significantly alters strategies for profit maximization and, most likely, equilibrium mixes of programs. We also show that allowing for viewers who are differentiated in their preferences for products can lead to dramatic departures from the equilibria and audience maximization strategies described in the traditional program choice literature. Ironically, the predictions of the traditional models are likely to be more accurate for television markets with addressable ads than for the markets with non addressable ads they were supposed to describe."
2005-0055,Adolescents Online Communication and Their Closeness to Friends,Top Four Papers in Developmental Communication,Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,Adolescents Online Communication and Their Closeness to Friends,Top Four Papers in Developmental Communication,"We investigated how social anxiety and loneliness affect adolescents online communication and their closeness to friends. Drawing on a sample of 816 adolescents, we tested an Internet-effects model, which assumes that adolescents perceptions of the Internets effectiveness for developing breadth and depth of communication are significant mediators of the effects of loneliness and social anxiety on (a) online communication and (b) closeness to friends. Our model was largely supported by the data. Closeness to friends was positively predicted by online communication and adolescents perceptions of the Internets effectiveness for developing depth of communication. Social anxiety was a negative predictor of online communication. However, when socially anxious adolescents believed in the Internets effectiveness for developing breadth and depth of communication, they benefited just as much as less socially anxious adolescents from the Internets opportunities to stimulate closeness of friendships."
2005-0056,Adolscents and Communication Regarding Sex and Contraception,Applied Interpersonal Communication: Health Matters,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Adolscents and Communication Regarding Sex and Contraception,Applied Interpersonal Communication: Health Matters,"As adolescent pregnancy, childbearing and STD transmission have continued to be a pervasive problem in American society, it has become more and more critical to understand the nuances of teen sexual behavior. Policy makers, parents, teachers, and community advocates are actively searching and advocating for interventions that will assist young people in reducing the risk associated with sexual involvement. Thus, this research focused on expanding our understanding of adolscents communication regarding sex and contraception.

This study focused on 18- and 19-year old adolescents, seeking to advance our understanding of the theoretical frameworks that may predict or be associated with adolescent sexual and contraceptive communicative behavior. Identity and self esteem were used to investigate these antecedents influence on adolescent sexual and contraceptive communication. In particular, this research examine how these theoretical perspectives affect adolescents communication self efficacy, comfort discussing sex and contraception and perceived communication self efficacy regarding sex and contraception.

This study adds to the research in interpersonal communication and adolescent development by probing what theoretical perspectives may offer a framework for understanding adolescent communication related to sex and contraception; it illustrates that adolescents identity status does increase ones communication efficacy, but the results did not confirm the relationship between identity status and sex and contraceptive discussions. It remains to be seen whether identity status differences influence adolescents communication about their sexual behavior."
2005-0057,Ad Placement Matters: A Psychophysiological Re-examination of Program Context Effects on Emotional Responses and Cognitive Effort to Advertising,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,Information Systems,,,Paper,Ad Placement Matters: A Psychophysiological Re-examination of Program Context Effects on Emotional Responses and Cognitive Effort to Advertising,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,"This study aims to offer a clearer explanation of the program context effects on advertising processing by addressing theoretical and measurement weaknesses in previous research. Previous studies on program context effects are mainly based on two branches of theoretical explanationsthe excitation transfer theory and the emotional congruency theory. Each branch of study focuses on one dimension of emotionarousal or valencebut ignores the other. By employing the dimensional theory of emotion and the limited capacity model of mediated messages processing (LCMMMP), both the arousing content and valence of the program are investigated in this study. In addition, the effects of time are also investigated.
Methodologically, previous studies in this area have used either self-report data or secondary data, which is not satisfying for measuring the subtle and continuous emotional responses during program and advertising processing. Psychophysiological measurement may be a more appropriate for precisely pinpointing viewers over time media induced responses, which makes investigation of the time factor possible. In this study, physiological arousal level is accessed by measuring skin conductance responses, valence by measuring facial EMG, and cognitive effort by measuring heart rate."
2005-0058,"Advertising, Nostalgia and the Construction of Commodities as Realms of Memory",Unpacking Cultural Codes of Advertising,Popular Communication,,,Paper,"Advertising, Nostalgia and the Construction of Commodities as Realms of Memory",Unpacking Cultural Codes of Advertising,"The paper explores the use of nostalgia in advertising as a practice that shapes perceptions of the collective past. It offers the idea of the ""realm of memory"" as a means of conceptualizing the way in which advertising represents the past. The positioning of products as constructed realms of memory offers consumers an emotional and immediate connection to an assumed better past. While doing so, advertising also influences the way consumers perceive ""real"" history, ""as it was,"" through all the means that were formerly investigated through collective memory studies: selection, personification, construction through the use of various narrative patterns and more."
2005-0059,A Feminine Footprint: Reconciling Conflicting Evidence in News Media Products,Women and the News,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,A Feminine Footprint: Reconciling Conflicting Evidence in News Media Products,Women and the News,"The present article seeks to shed light on one of the most challenging questions in the study of gender and the media: Is the growing entry of women into newsrooms changing the conventional structuring of the media agenda and affecting the patterns of news production and content? For some time now, womens accelerated entry into journalism has attracted the attention of scholars in examining the diverse aspects of the news production process.

According to some arguments, media and journalistic practice, by its very nature and the nature of the work process, is professional and is non-gender. Others claim that the complex organizational apparatus that is engaged in the selection, production and presentation of the news to the public, precludes the influence of any single individual, however senior his or her position in the organization may be. Yet others believe that the increasing entry of women into journalism will radiate changes in the content of the media and the news agenda."
2005-0060,A Feminist Icon in Uncharted Territory: The Public Memory of Gloria Steinem,Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,A Feminist Icon in Uncharted Territory: The Public Memory of Gloria Steinem,Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,"This paper focuses on the public memory of Gloria Steinem as a feminist figurehead. This research is exploring an area in public memory that has traditionally been confined to events instead of people, and seeking what that means for feminism and feminist scholarship as a whole. This paper seeks to explore how the public memory of Gloria Steinem has been constructed, and how that memory is connected to the feminist movement. Drawing from past scholarly work in the area of public memory (Vivian, 2002, & Mandzuik, 2003), this paper looks at how public memory has been constructed and used. This work also explores the concept of competing personas and its effect on the feminist movement, especially in light of third wave feminism."
2005-0061,A Feminist Vision of Empowerment in Alternative Media Practices:,"Empowering Women: Activism, Resistance, Liberation",Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,A Feminist Vision of Empowerment in Alternative Media Practices:,"Empowering Women: Activism, Resistance, Liberation","Feminist scholarship in communication research often invokes empowerment when discussing issues such as discourse, experience, agency and resistance, with or without specific notes on what it really means. Yet, feminist insistence on the understanding of the complexity of power in guiding our struggles for a fair and equitable society, especially following a Foucauldian analysis, demands a comparable vision of empowerment. This essay intends to enrich the discussion by engaging in conceptualization of a feminist vision of empowerment. It argues for two components: discursive empowerment and experiential empowerment. In the context of feminist praxis, the two types of empowerment converge into an integrated, liberatory feminist struggle that truly empowers the marginalized groups in society. Two instances of visual media practice that claimed to empower women: participatory photography called Photovoice conducted in China and Guatemala respectively are analyzed against the feminist vision of empowerment. Participatory photography features the use of cameras by people who are usually the subjects of the gaze of photojournalism. These photos are then organized into books or exhibitions or websites that reach a much larger, sometimes a global audience. Marginalized groups thus can use simple cameras to tell stories of their needs, their desires, and their realities. This alternative media practice not only gives those voiceless a voice, it also makes this voice visible, in a world where seeing is believing. The paper assesses the projects potentials and limits for a feminist vision of empowerment."
2005-0062,A Fluency of Feeling: Exploring Variations in Culture Rules for Provisions of Social Support,Culture and Social Support,Intercultural & Development Communication,,Intercultural Communication,Paper,A Fluency of Feeling: Exploring Variations in Culture Rules for Provisions of Social Support,Culture and Social Support,"The present study represents an initial effort towards a theoretical model of cultural rules for social support. Specifically, cultural differences (Euro-American and Mainland Chinese) and individual differences (personal distinction and interpersonal belonging) were analyzed with regard to rule structures that govern the importance accorded to interactive support goals and the evaluation of effective social support messages. In terms of providing effective support, the link between culture and self appears to be a matter identifying with a sense of personal distinction and wider societal values of individualism and collectivism. The interaction between individual differences and culture contributes to an enhanced motivation for providing effective support. In contrast, cultural institutions in and of themselves, contribute to an understanding of effective message strategies. Limitations and future directions for cross-cultural research are discussed."
2005-0063,A Frame Analysis of the Russian Television Coverage of the Coming of the Iraq War,Public Opinion in War Time,Mass Communication,,,Paper,A Frame Analysis of the Russian Television Coverage of the Coming of the Iraq War,Public Opinion in War Time,"This paper explores how Russian mass media covered the coming of the 2003 Iraq war. The main focus of this work is what type of frames dominated the Russian television coverage of the coming of the war. This should shed some light on the pattern of political thinking and on the criteria used by the Russians when they decided to oppose the 2003 war in Iraq. There are four dominant frames identified in the works of three prominent Russian TV commentators. They are the frames of hypocrisy, low value of any partnership with the U.S., the geopolitical and global security frame, and the frame of the Russian security interests. It is suggested that the reason for the appearance of all these frames on Russian TV is the actual set of international policies conducted by the American government in the world in general and in relation to Russia in particular."

In following with Youngs idea of special representation for oppressed and disadvantaged social groups, the theory is expanded to include the ethnic newspaper. The paper draws on theories of democracy proposed by Young and Alexis de Tocqueville. To explore this theory the community of Riverdale is used as a case study. The paper concludes by asking whether a newspaper can truly be thought of as a public space, and by looking at the role of the community newspaper in an increasingly centralized democracy."
2005-0065,African and African American Communication,tercultural Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,Intercultural & Development Communication,,Intercultural Communication,Paper,African and African American Communication,Intercultural Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,"There have been noticeable differences and similarities in the communicative behaviors of Africans and African American college students on the campuses of historically black colleges and universities. The differences are due, in part, to the cultural and historical factors that have nurtured the two groups. African Americans are the derivatives of enslaved Africans who arrived in the New World in 1619. The socio-historical acculturation of a new culture in America introduced them to different languages, customs, traditions and religion. This new civilization has created a change in the attitude and subsequent behaviors of African Americans towards African immigrants who, by and large, became known as Africans in the Diaspora living in the United States in and around the 1960s.
With the introduction of the Diversity Visa lottery in the late 1990s, many immigrants mostly from Africa have immigrated in large numbers to the United States. Brenda Williams (1998) asserts that more than 20,000 {sic} visas go to Africans (p.2). As a result of this significant influx of Africans into the United States each year, there is a corresponding increase in the desire for educational advancement among African students residing domestically; as well as those coming directly from Africa with J1 Visa for educational quests. This study focuses its attention on those Africans and African American students studying at HBCUs and having daily interactions with each other and with other Africans and African American non- students alike."
2005-0066,A Fulfillable Request: Structuring the Customer's World in Airline Service Calls,"Coorientation in Action: How People Produce Asymmetries, Constraints and Compliance Through Talk",Language & Social Interaction,,,Paper,A Fulfillable Request: Structuring the Customer's World in Airline Service Calls,"Coorientation in Action: How People Produce Asymmetries, Constraints and Compliance Through Talk","This paper examines how agents avoid a possible rejection of a callers request in airline service calls. When a caller makes a request for a reservation, agents initiate a series of question-answer insertion sequences of dealing with flight information including date, itinerary, time, and number of passengers, and direct such specifications until a caller gets down to a request for a specific flight. In working through such specifications, agents construct their talk by embedding a restriction on the flight availability at a particular level of specification. For example, when a caller asks what times flights are available before answering the agents insertion question about the flight time desired, agents respond by embedding a restriction on the number of seats, for example, We have one seat for twelve thirty five and one seat for one twenty five. In so doing, they not only preempt a caller from specifying the request in that particular detail -- the number of seats in this example -- but also constrain the ways in which the caller can proceed to making or specifying the request. That is, by constraining their talk to what is available and thus to what will be accepted when a caller makes a request accordingly, agents restrict what a caller can affirmatively bid for. Thereby, agents constrain the caller to request what they can fulfill in the subsequent trajectory of the request sequence. Thus, agents structure the caller into making a fulfillable request and avoid having to reject the request directly."

Self-Portrayals of Political Parties in Their Press Releases and the Media,Determining Media Content,"Mass media have become so important that nowadays that they are the most impor-tant source of political information for the greatest part of the electorate. The way the media present politics has the potential to determine what people know and, to some extend, how people think. It is thus comprehensible that political parties try to exert an influence on their presentation by the mass media. Our study wants to demonstrate how (un)successful the German political parties were in having their issues covered during the campaign for the general election in 2002. In order to do this we coded all relevant press releases put out by the five major parties (n=1.015) in the six months prior to the election and compared their contents and rhetoric structure with the sub-sequent media coverage (n=6.699). Our findings suggest that the effect of political PR was moderate. The parties who were most active were not necessarily the parties which were covered most, the emphasis placed on either policy issues or politics statements was not recognized by the media, the correlations between the agendas of the press releases and the media varied, and the journalists refrained from using destructive rhetoric devices as frequently as the public relations officers."

2005-0069,Agenda Building: Some News About News Initiatives,Determining Media Content,Political Communication,,,Paper,Agenda Building: Some News About News Initiatives,Determining Media Content,"The role of reporters and sources in the building of the agenda is neither too dynamic, as described by the reciprocal models (exchange and role relationship), nor rigid as claimed by the one-sided models (hegemony and adversarial), but rather a combination of the two. According to the process model suggested and examined here, the relations between both parties are indeed dynamic, but they take place within a quite rigid scenario. Most of the news stories are formed in a relay-race pattern; the reporters begin by waiting for the source's baton but instantly thereafter they take off and sprint. Seventy percent of the stories which were published in the three leading Israeli dailies began at the initiative of sources, but continued with the reporters initiating information-gathering contacts at the same rate. The study uses an innovative methodology of face-to-face reconstruction interviews in a way that overcame the hurdle of source confidentiality."

2005-0071,A Generative Grammar of Communication Theories,Misunderstanding Argument and War,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,A Generative Grammar of Communication Theories,Misunderstanding Argument and War,"This article is a continuation of a study presented at the ICA convention in 2004, critically examining ways in which communication theories have been conceptualized, and proposing a change of classification grounds. We consider that current patterns of association for communication theories are based on either superficial or false analogies, and we have imagined a metatheoretical model that brings awareness to things known but not recognized. We name our classificatory framework a grammar, as we analyze functions of existing and potential structuration processes, not elements of particular belief systems. We conceive our grammar as generative, as it points not toward phenomena but toward possibilities of phenomena. This article discusses a series of arguments for the formulation of a generative grammar of communication theories, gives an overview of the components of this approach, and provides details about a generative morphology and syntax of communication theories (which will be completed with a semantics and a pragmatics)."

The research examines Northern and Southern newspaper coverage of the hysteria gripping other slave holding states in the aftermath of Nat Turner's Revolt. It addresses how those reports reflected, what media scholar Roger Fowler calls, a hysterical style of the press and contributed to a ""moral panic."""
2005-0073,A Lesson in Canadian Cable Broadband Policy,"Think Global, Act Local: Searching Far and Wide for Policy Success",Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,A Lesson in Canadian Cable Broadband Policy,"Think Global, Act Local: Searching Far and Wide for Policy Success","The United States government wishes to have a universally available high-speed Internet infrastructure by 2007. However, there exist many competing ideas about how this rollout might best be achieved. This paper deals specifically with two of these: the market versus the open access approach. Market proponents argue that the government should take a hands-off approach to regulation and let the marketplace determine how broadband deployment should occur. Open access proponents maintain the government should use regulation to assure that the broadband infrastructure remains true to the end-to-end architecture upon which the Internet was built. This debate is particularly heated when it concerns Internet provided over the cable broadband platform.

This paper explores the U.S. government’s problem in more detail, and then takes a closer look at Canadian cable broadband policy. It is determined that Canada’s hybrid approach to cable broadband regulation has both allowed for the deployment of broadband infrastructure while also assuring that competing high-speed retial-level providers maintain a presence in the market. Further, given the legislation governing telecommunications in both the United States in Canada, an argument is made for the fungibility (or transferability) of Canadian policy to the United States’ problem."

Additionally, research to date has often used inadequate measures of interpersonal communication styles. In this research, a multi-phase lexical approach was used to uncover the main communication styles. In the first three phases, adjectives were selected based on their ability to describe a communication style. In the fourth and final phase, 200 respondents provided self-rating on 749 communication adjectives. The adjectives were submitted to a Principal Component Analysis, which provided evidence of seven main communication style dimensions. This paper describes the lexical research process and the content and interrelations of the seven main communication style dimensions."

It does so by examining the strengths and shortcomings of the framing literature when it comes to the puzzling challenge of discussing al Jazeera, the 24-hour Arabic satellite news outlet. Framing research has implicit or explicit assumptions concerning the way political power affects the framing process. Framing scholarship as generally established by Western scholars and idiosyncratic to the American media and the American power structure, overlooks the cultural and sociopolitical context of functioning of international media organizations. More important, scholarship on media frames and power do not take into account new technology, the relative freedom from domestic regulation and decentralized flow of information characteristic of Al Jazeera and similar entities.
Al Jazeera is deemed to be significantly anti-hegemonic. This paper demonstrates why this thrust can be understood through deficiencies in framing scholarship. In the traditional Western framing research media have been seen as contributing to the sustenance and reinforcement of existing power structure, that is hegemony (Gitlin, 1980). Hegemony has been conceived in terms of the dominance of a national political power structure. I argue that al Jazeera has challenged hegemony, and is considered to have been an anti-hegemonic force in the Arab world - as a satellite channel freed from domestic media regulations and national power structures."

Specifically, we examined whether synchronous communication channel use can influence subsequent emotions, communication satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. We also built up a causal model to access the associations among these variables.
A longitudinal study was conducted with 66 participants completing pre-post test surveys and daily communication log across a week. Based on results from cross- lag regressions and structural equation modeling, the use of synchronous channels did not influence any of the outcome variables (i.e., emotions, communication satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction); however, the subjects preference for using synchronous channels over asynchronous channels directly affected the level of happiness and anger, and indirectly affected communication and relationship satisfaction through its impact on the preceding variables. Possible empirical and theoretical explanations for the findings were also discussed."

across 18 different channels, the frequency and context of altruistic actions were content analyzed. Different from previous content analytic research in the prosocial arena, we focused squarely on altruistic actions. Because the definition of altruism is hotly debated, we crafted a series of measures to tap four different conceptualizations of this construct. The results reveal that the way altruism is conceived significantly alters the amount, and to a lesser extent, the context of such acts. Independent of definition, child-oriented basic cable channels outscore other outlets in the saturation of altruistic acts on television."

In this paper we explore the production of ambiguity as an output of managerial conversation. We hypothesize that ambiguity is an inevitable consequence of being simultaneously different and unified. Our attention is focused on the discursive mechanisms that go into producing ambiguity. We illustrate by drawing on the filmed reproduction of a managerial encounter centered, reflexively, on its own modes of accommodating diversity and unity. We examine the conversational mechanisms by means of which contradiction is accommodated. Finally, the paper concludes with some observations on the value of ambiguity as an integrative mode of organizing."

But the focus of this research has been almost exclusively on positive and negative thoughts in response to the message. In this paper we present a self-reported measure that assesses the strength of the arguments embedded in anti-drug PSAs directed at adolescents.

Empirical evidence for the reliability and validity of this scale is provided."
2005-0080,Amelie: A False Dialogue with Emancipation,Deconstructing Identity in Film,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Amelie: A False Dialogue with Emancipation,Deconstructing Identity in Film,"For over a decade, Gramscis theory of hegemony has rewardingly informed scholars analyses of popular culture. In my paper, I adopt it as main theoretical framework in interpreting the internationally acclaimed French movie, Amelie. My goal is to reveal what mechanisms of hegemony the movie uses and how they work to make acceptable a patriarchal definition of femininity. I argue that the hegemonic construction of femininity in Amelie can offer a convincing explanation of the films success. This movie revolves around its main female character: the stereotypical virgin woman who plans to get the man and who finds self-fulfillment only in helping others and in love. In this framework of traditional femininity, Amelie is hegemonically granted the agency to gaze at others, to escape sexualized masculine gazes, to transform peoples lives, and to further the narrative thread of the story, all conventionally masculine privileges. These elements of agency have also made the film delightful to viewers with progressive views on gender. They find pleasure in watching Amelie take action and trespassing the role of the passive sexualized object that women usually occupy. I argue that these moments of getting out of the gender box only offer an escape into a bigger and more unyielding patriarchal box; Amelie is constructed like a Russian doll. In this interpretation, Amelie becomes a product of mass culture that strengthens patriarchy more successfully than blatantly sexist products could."

Social Representations of Immigration and Ethics in Jesica Santillans Failed Transplant,Media Representations,"Jesica Santillan's ""botched transplant"" generated significant media coverage in February and March of 2003. Social representation provides the theoretical framework for the analysis of national and local television and print coverage of the story. The analysis focuses on two major issues that arise out of the coverage, immigration and ethics. Jesica's case becomes a microcosm of discourse that displays shifting and competing portrayals of who has the right to pursue the American Dream. Representations also arise surrounding the process of organ donation, alternately feeding our desire for the miracles of modern medicine to playing into the publics' fears and doubts about the medical profession. These representations have strong implications for how individuals make decisions about organ donation."

Previous meta-analyses (Allen & Burrell, 2002; Lau, Sigelman, Heldman, & Babbitt, 1999) found little or no net benefit to negative versus positive ads. However, this finding does not reveal whether ads have effects (both or neither could be persuasive). A meta-analysis revealed that political spots increased issue knowledge, influenced perceptions of the candidates character, altered attitudes, increased campaign interest, and affected candidate preference; there was no effect for agenda-setting or vote likelihood (turnout). One moderator variable was detected: The effect size for learning was larger for studies of students than non-students; however, the effect size for both sub-groups was significant. Ads also had larger effects on attitudes for non-students than students."
2005-0084,Am I Punk? Communication Of Punk Identity In Online Message Boards,(Sub)cultural Identities in Popular Communication,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Am I Punk? Communication Of Punk Identity In Online Message Boards,(Sub)cultural Identities in Popular Communication,"American teenagers today spend more time with the Internet than any other form of media (Morrissey, 2003) creating a shift in the primary medium through which teen culture is created, shared, and debated. This study investigates the communication of teen culture, specifically punk culture, through inductive analysis of Internet message board posts. Among teens that self-identify as punk, a recurrent theme of in-group/out-group comparison emerged, with three indicators of punk identity: music, style, and brands. The existence of criteria for group belonging and the use of taste and material possessions to express group belonging adhere to tenets of Social Comparison Theory (Festinger, 1954), Social Identity Theory (Tajfel, 1978), and the Theory of Extended Self (Belk 1988). The data illustrate that even in online environments, where no objective measure of identity exists adolescents seek out signifiers of in-group membership. Among punk adolescents, music, style, and brands served as the indicators against which levels of belonging are gauged. Within the online punk culture music and style identify in-group members through a preference for underground punk bands and a who cares what others think mentality to style. Yet, ironically, it appears that brands identify those belonging to the out-group, the teenies and preps, as opposed to identifying members as punk. Findings suggest two distinct issues: 1) the extension of Social Comparison Theory, Social Identity Theory, and the Theory of Extended Self to the virtual environment and 2) counter-cultural approaches to punk culture cannot account for the great diversity within the culture."

However, a lot of gaming is social in nature, for example in the case of multiplayer games, or on-line gaming on the Internet. We studied gaming at a LAN event where people link their computers to a Local Area Network in order to play against each other. Thus far, this kind of gaming in a social context has not received much attention from researchers. Our study aimed to reveal why the participants liked LAN gaming, and, more specifically, why they preferred the violent games that are commonplace at LAN events. We deliberately choose to interview both male and female participants, although women are a minority at LAN events. We conducted open interviews with six male and six female LAN gamers. The interviews were interpreted using a grounded theory framework. Our interpretation showed the participants were motivated by both competitive and social motives. They were also attracted to the violent content of the games, often labeling it as a kind of dark humor. Our conclusion that there were hardly any differences between male and female gamers warrants further research about the relevance of gender with respect to the reception of video games."

In this essay, I premise that public relations engages in a public dialogue, and I assert that public relations practices should play a leading role in developing ethical relationships between an organization and its public. Additionally, this study discusses the characteristics of this dialogue in relation to issues of power and how dialogue develops differently depending on different power relations. For these ends, I explore communication constituencies which are competing and engaging in the process and their exchanging relationships to point out problems in current public relations practices and studies. Finally, I offer a postmodern perspective of public relations. The postmodern interpretation of public relations offers a critical approach to public relations practices and suggests ethical practices by guiding the practitioners to perform ethically in the process of public dialogue."

Theories of deliberative democracy may help explain why young people are consistently less interested in political participation and also provide a heuristic model for improvement. Using structural equation modeling, this study tests whether the relationship between civic education and political participation is direct or mediated by discursive variables and to detect how such a mediating process might operate. The data come from a survey of 362 school children, grades 5-12, in a northeastern urban school district at Buffalo, NY. Findings show that the relationship between civic education and political participation can be better understood as being mediated by discursive variables rather than direct. Findings also reveal that discursivity can be related to political participation. In addition, all research variables were related more strongly to communication variables such as political discussion than to the Internet variables."

It aimed to investigate the characteristics of and to provide a comparison of real Filipino (married couples) and reel (Filipino couples in romance novels) couples. The study found out that the structure and linguistic (e.g., grammatical, syntactic and semantic style) of the dialogues between real and reel couples differed  real couples talk is oralin nature  e.g., with shorter words in a sentence, while reel couples in the novels talk the way the writers wanted them to express -- in more narrative, lengthier, repetitive style for emphasis and reinforcement of their thoughts and ideas in the readers minds

Using Miller, et al.s communication styles framework, a general trend has been found that style 1, followed by style 3 then by style 2 is what characterizes talk between reel and real couples. This somewhat indicates that talk in romance novels parallel the style of talk in real-life situations.

In terms of the content of the talk, the study found that both real and reel couples talked about topic messages more than relationship-messages (relationship-messages were least of all the message types for both real and reel couples). This brings to mind that perhaps both in real and reel life, there is more to intimate talk than talking about intimate or very private matters.

In spite of the surge of the number of mothers in the workforce, research has demonstrated that even in situations where both the mother and father work, it is mostly the mother who is responsible for being the primary care-giver and household laborer on a daily basis. How then do the media portray this issue of work/home divide and the solutions to it? In this project, I examined a selected group of major newspaper stories over the time span of one year, regarding the work/home divide. I interrogated how men and women are present or absent as solutions to the problem of the work/home divide. In other words, I examined whether the current public discourse revolving around the balancing of work and home conceptualizes men and fathers as central to, or peripheral to the problem. Informed by a critical interpretation of current discourses regarding the relationship between family roles and gender, I examined how current debates and arguments about the work/home divide construct the roles of the father and the mother. The study found that the woman and her individual choices are at the center of the discourse of the work/home divide whereas other solutions such as organizational change, change in governmental policy and especially the involvement of men, are systematically backgrounded."

The media provide information about democratic change, champion social and political issues, and investigative reporting can expose corruption of political leaders. NGOs also contribute to civil society by advocating for the under-represented, serving marginalized publics, and agenda setting. The purpose of this paper is to explore the ways in which Croatian citizens perceive the media and NGOs in their contributions to civil society. The results of a longitudinal study (2000, 2002) suggest that the media and NGOs have a civil society role and that certain media and NGOs are perceived to be more civil society-oriented than others. Implications for this research are discussed."

This paper explores the CPJs campaign against one of the more prominent threats facing Latin American journalists: criminal defamation. It shows that organized domestic and international advocacy groups can and do make improvements on behalf of journalists and press freedom. The CPJs activities raise issues and place them on the agenda, help individual journalists, and influence discourse, policy, institutional procedures, and state behavior. The effectiveness of the campaigns is conditioned upon the involvement of local press groups, the target audiences, the issues, and the credibility of the CPJ. This case study helps fill a significant gap in the research on transnational advocacy and its influence; at the same time it extends existing theoretical models to include advocacy groups work with individuals."

A model was tested with a sample of 329 undergraduate participants. Results indicated that the link between Internet self-efficacy and perceived usefulness of IM was very strong. Subsequently, attitude toward using IM was impacted by perceived usefulness of IM. Also, peer groups subjective norm about IM accurately predicted intention to use IM. However, intention did not predict IM use for users, and attitude toward using IM did not predict intention to use IM for either group. Finally, a post hoc search for an alternative model that fit the data was undertaken."

How does it affect identity, if at all? Are opportunity and circumstance in the health care profession oriented around race, or does personal agency have greater influence? How do the complexities of race, gender, and profession create and maintain perceptions of personal identity in the work place? Ignoring racial issues in the work place will not make them go away. I suggest we find a dialogue with which to communicate these issues in the work place and reach a better understanding of one another."

However, the pragmatic attitude about the concept should be incorporated with the understanding of the conditions of the public sphere in the society since the clarification of the concept requires a systematic comprehension of our own society (Habermas, 1962, p.5). Current study, thus, aims to understand the social conditions and the culture of the public sphere in U.S. through the analysis of the online public forums in twenty-five local online newspapers. In addition to the identification of three aspects of the online forum, we explore to describe the forms and uses of the online forums in the local online newspapers across U.S. Findings of the study show that the forms and uses of the online forums in the local newspapers might be shaped by the institutional relations of the companies with their mother-corporations. In addition, the analysis also indicates that the forms and uses of the forum might be characterized as closed structures of the forums constraining user participation."

A pre-post-test survey of 106 students enrolled in a media ethics course in 2001, 2003 and 2004 found significant changes in how students ranked values such as Fair, Independent, Aboveboard and Avoiding harm at the beginning of the course compared with at the end. The study also found significant decreases in students degrees of idealism and relativism after taking the course, though degrees of both remained high overall."

Participants (N = 288) responded to an open-ended web-based survey question asking them to describe how legally recognized same-sex marriage was influencing their view of their own romantic relationship or romantic relationships in general. Results indicate that legally recognized same-sex marriage impacted participants' understanding of romantic relationships by making existing relationships seem more real and by serving as a tool through which participants realized their desires for ideal potential partner and relationship characteristics. The results suggest that legally recognized same-sex marriage is seen as both beneficial and challenging for same-sex couples."

Through the analysis this paper finds that screen quota systems can be economically most effective among the four on one condition. The condition requires the quotas to be set at a rate which can assure audiences full right of choice so that domestic film markets can be placed in context of sufficient competition with foreign films. The analysis also suggests that broadcasting quotas backed by screen quotas or vice versa can be even more effective.

This paper then investigates the validity of this analysis through a study of the Korean case. The investigation particularly focuses on the Korean screen quota system in terms of its effectiveness in creating the following effects: (i) a decrease in the level of uncertainty involving domestic film distribution and exhibition; (ii) subsequent encouragement of private investment for domestic film production and marketing; (iii) the enhancement of domestic film quality and diversity; (iv) the rapid augmentation of the domestic film market size as a whole, resulting in a concomitant expansion of the domestic market for foreign films; (v) an increase in export of the domestic films and augmentation of the overseas market for domestic films; (vi) an accelerated increase in investment for domestic film production and marketing. The synergy effect of the broadcasting quota system is also considered."

Past literature operationalizes cooperative-competitive relationships in normative ways and overlooks organizational perceptions based on historical relationships in a system. The proposed measure includes questions that reflect various underlying characteristics of cooperation-competition such as trust/deceit, supportiveness/lack of supportiveness, usefulness/lack of information, and shared/competing goals. The results are based on an inter-organizational system of cooperative competitors. Results of an exploratory factor analysis identify two dimensions, cooperation and competition. The discussion addresses the theoretical and pragmatic utility of the survey in organizational networks research."

It does so by extending Valentes (2003) network approach to diffusion of innovations by including media characters in the social network. The resulting equation accounts for both endogenous factors in the resulting network as well as exogenous media characterizations. The approach is multi-theoretical and multi-level, and is grounded in entertainment theories of affective disposition (Horton & Wohl, 1956; Kincaid, 1988, 2002; Rubin & Perse, 1987; Zillman, 1991), Rogers (2003) diffusion of innovations research as well as Banduras (2002, 2003) social cognitive theory. The application of this research to entertainment-education programs is referenced via a Tanzanian media program, Twende na Wakati. The paper closes with a call for multiple methods of study design and data collection, with content analysis to supplement behavior change and network data."

This study examines the effect of anxiety on type of persuasive message processing route. It was predicted that as levels of anxiety increased so would systematic processing. Increased systematic processing was predicted to be related to increased memory performance. Fifty-eight students from communication courses at a large Midwestern university participated voluntarily; they read a persuasive message and in order to determine systematic processing, listed their thoughts about, and completed a memory measure for the message. Their anxiety levels were assessed during different points of the study using the state portion of Spielbergers STAI. Results from this study show that anxiety did not relate significantly to systematic processing. The Pearson correlation between anxiety and systematic thoughts was negative, and non-significant, r = -.176, p = .187. It was also postulated that as systematic thoughts increased, so too would memory performance as measured by hits. The Pearson correlation coefficient between hits and systematic thoughts was both negative and non-significant, r = -.119, n.s. Although non-significant, results indicate that since anxiety does not function in this study as the Negative State Relief Model suggests, it deserves further study in relation to message processing routes, as well as consideration as to whether it is a negative or positive state."

As a part of larger study, the reciprocation of the strategy and tactics between negotiators were examined. One hundred and seventy pairs of participants (N=340) negotiated based on a simple negotiation scenario involving conflict of interest. Videotaped negotiation sessions were coded based on five strategies suggested by Dual Concern Theory (Pruitt & Carnevale, 1993; Rubin, Pruitt, & Kim, 1994) and nine tactics (e.g. Weingart, et al., 1990). Significant positive interdependence between negotiators strategic choices was observed for three of general strategies and eight of specific tactics. Implications and limitations in interpreting this study was discussed."

This exploratory study examined multinational brands visual strategies in Web advertising by comparing their Korean and U.S. local sites. A content analysis of a sample of 31 brands was conducted based on a theoretical linkage between Halls (1973) information context value and Moriartys (1987) typology of visual functions.
The findings reveal significant between-country differences in the type of visual functions, the use of photographs and illustrations, and the frequency of product portrayals in the visual, implying that the observed between-country differences are attributable to the differences in cultural values between Korea and the U.S., particularly high vs. low information context. The authors speculate that if the aim of multinational advertisers is to confer specific values to their products and advertising to attract consumers worldwide, it can be achieved most effectively at the executional level and if done within value framework that exists in the cultural contexts of foreign markets."

Historical background information is briefly introduced to facilitate the readers understanding about the origin of traditional Korean governments attitude toward the regulation of eumlanmul, or sexually explicit materials. Based on the understanding of the peculiarity of Korean history, the legal concept such as eumlan and the relevant Korean laws regulating sexually explicit materials are discussed.
In addition, the classifications and types of indecent information in Korea are introduced along with the Internet content rating criteria by Information Communication Ethics Committee (ICEC). Based on the knowledge provided in the previous sections, three problems inherent in the current Internet content regulation are critically discussed and alternative regulation approaches as policy recommendations are suggested."

Moreover, scholars from both research traditions have acknowledged the powerful role that childrens cognitive and moral development can play in their responses to such media content. This content analysis seeks to merge that body of theory with recent theoretical developments regarding the enjoyment of select types of dramatic narratives. One recent theory of the enjoyment of crime drama proposed that the degree to which the punishment depicted in a program mirrored a viewers own sense of fairness, the greater the enjoyment of the narrative. In addition, research has also shown that young viewers, because of their markedly different age-specific stages of moral development, prefer outcomes where aggressors are subject to expiatory punishment as opposed to equitable punishment. This content analysis examines the conflict-resolution themes in childrens television and measure the degree of retaliatory equity present in these programs. The results indicate that in childrens television in general, and especially in educational television, the resolution of these conflict-resolution sequences is rarely equitable. The implications of these findings for these programs educational and entertainment potential are discussed."
2005-0118,An Integrative Approach to Message Judgment: Priming and Prospect Theory,Covering Issues of Risk,Mass Communication,,,Paper,An Integrative Approach to Message Judgment: Priming and Prospect Theory,Covering Issues of Risk,"The paper aims at placing prospect theory in the context of health care communication and examines its relationship with mass communication theory. More specifically, prospect theory is an organizing construct that informs priming and elaboration likelihood model of persuasion. This research attempts to introduce a more rigorous psychological perspective to shed light on message design by integrating psychological and persuasion theories. Consistent with the prediction, benefit primed subjects found a gain framed PSA more convincing and interesting. The cost prime group found a cost framed PSA more persuasive, demonstrating the connections of semantic matching with PSA evaluations. These findings were compatible with the assimilation effects in priming studies and the framing postulate of the prospect theory. All in all, the results suggest that a PSA on physical activity, which is positively framed, may also incorporate negatively framed information to attract people's attention. These results suggest that emphasizing the benefits of exercise - rather than solely emphasizing mortality and morbidity statistics - could be a promising route for future health promotion efforts."

Questioning Common Perceptions of Online Communication By Investigating Email Usernames,Identity and Identification Dynamics Online,"This paper presents a study of anonymity and identity as played out in email usernames. Using a web-based survey, we asked a series of forced-choice and open-ended questions designed to find out how people obtained their most frequently and second most frequently used email addresses, how identified or anonymous they felt using each, and what kind of interactions and interactional partners they would have with each address. This paper is based on data from the 138 people (out of 217 total responses) who indicated having at least two email addresses. Data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. We found that, in general, email addresses tend to be perceived as being highly identifiable, although the level of anonymity/identifiability did change with respect to several of our variables."

This study investigates the role of these types of anonymity on the production of abstract and stereotypical language. An examination of 64 messageboard communications made by participants assigned to four anonymity conditions (visually and personally anonymous, visually anonymous but personally identifiable, visually identifiable but personally anonymous, visually and personally identifiable) revealed that only participants who were visually identifiable exhibited the group norm to a significant degree. These results are inconsistent with predictions derived from SIDE theory. Possible limitations and alternative explanations are discussed."

Critical Experiences vis-à-vis the Dictatorship of the Market,Retheorising Communication,"Along the lines of the alter-globalization hope that has sprung forth in the social forums of Porto Alegre and Bombay, the present article analyzes the underlying communicative experiences in four phenomena or specific situations: the Zapatista movement, the social reaction after the March 11th terrorist attacks in Madrid (2004), the incidents in Venezuela in 2002, and the proliferation of alternative sites on the internet. The author tries to demonstrate that in today's society Another Model of Communication (AMC) is possible and that it may also be effective in its objectives. It is a model that radically questions the functions of each and every one of the elements that are part of the communication process as we know it today. The article maintains that taking control of the media is not necessary in order to implement this model. It even states that it would not be desirable for this to happen."
2005-0122,Antecedents of Television Use for Mood Management by Adolescents,The Gratifying Media,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Antecedents of Television Use for Mood Management by Adolescents,The Gratifying Media,"According to Uses and Gratifications theory, individuals try to satisfy various needs by means of media use. However, it has been argued that the empirical application of the Uses and Gratifications approach is often problematic because of the inclusion of the concept of need in the theoretical framework and that the research focus should shift to social and psychological factors as origins of behaviour. In this paper we try to identify a few of these social and psychological factors which might explain motives for use of a particular medium by a certain audience segment. Specifically, we hypothesize that adolescents television use for mood management is predicted by factors related to school and family. To test this hypothesis, structural equation models were fitted to survey data obtained from 1888 high school students. Results support the hypothesis that tensions generated within the social contexts of home and school life are directly and indirectly related to the use of television for mood management. Implications for future research are discussed."

Analyzing survey data collected form student and adult groups, this study finds that the both groups tend to support more extreme forms of media restrictions for propaganda than for information and entertainment content. Further, our regression analyses indicate that message desirability and First Amendment support significantly predict censorship support, while self-other perception gap does not. Although general patterns for censorship support appear to be similar in both groups, close examination reveals that students and adults are different in terms of factors they consider for censorship support. Complex processes related to the development of opinions regarding policy options and future directions on the third-person effect research are discussed."

This study extends the research on organization-public relationship in public relations by incorporating the Anxiety and Uncertainty Management Theory (AUM). Specifically, this paper focuses on whether relationship cultivation strategies in public relations overlap with the axioms in AUM, and whether these strategies lead to more effective communication in multinational organizations and, in turn, to desired relational outcomes for the employees with the organization. This study also examines whether relationship cultivation strategies and relationship outcomes are affected by managing anxiety and uncertainty of employees toward organizations. Seventy-five international students were participants in this study (additional data are being collected). The study found support for all hypotheses except for one. An increase in access to organizations decision-making, positivity, openness and disclosure of organizations decision-making, shared network with organizational members, and sharing tasks were all positively related to the attributional confidence of organizational members and were negatively related to their anxiety. The influence of these strategies was greater on uncertainty than on anxiety. The strategy of assurance of legitimacy was not found to contribute to reducing anxiety. The management of anxiety and uncertainty played an important role in achieving effective communication which, in turn, was positively associated with relationship outcomes such as control mutuality, trust, relational satisfaction, and commitment."

The emphasis is on community and activism dimensions of the members interactions as a social movement. The treatment of the concepts of community and activism will largely address their epistemological aspects. The phenomenon within this computer mediated fan community suggests a richness of human self involvement with the programs text and a dogged grassroots campaign to save the show from cancellation.

Four factors were discovered among teens self-reported data about their motives for listening: entertainment, escape, social interaction, and habit/pass time. Ironically, findings also suggest that teens availability and time spent with other media have a very small impact on their radio use. Thus, application of the uses and gratifications approach to analyzing the U.S.s largest-ever generation of teens enabled us to move beyond a single-variable descriptive framework of radio listening motivations. This research offers a baseline analysis of interrelationships among listening motivations, age, gender, ethnicity, and amount of time spent listening  for subsequent analyses of radio listening behaviors and attitudes."

Furthermore, those who work on BCC projects using popular media as a vehicle  entertainment-education (EE) projects  are well acquainted with the commonplaces of behavioral science and behavioral research. And yet, the task of integrating behavioral science and research into the essentially creative process of EE has proven difficult. However committed to research and theory developers of BCC/EE projects may be, most would readily acknowledge that, in practical terms, this commitment is not systematically translated into the scripts of stories that are designed to help people change risky behaviors. This is largely due to a lack of tools that bridge the divide between the artistic world of storytelling and the demands of a structured, science-based, public health intervention.

In this paper, the presenter sets out both the challenges faced in developing theoretically sound and research-sensitive BCC/EE interventions and their response to those challenges. The Pathways to Change tools the presenter describes address several key junctures in intervention design and implementation in areas such as capacity building, product development, and monitoring and evaluation. Although aspects of this approach are applicable to any behavior change intervention, this explication of the Pathways to Change tools should be considered a case study: an account of how one project has approached the integration of behavioral science with narrative forms such as serial drama."

How Motivation Type Affects Processing of Risky Information,Why and How We Communication: The Role of Motivation,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,Approach or Avoid? How Motivation Type Affects Processing of Risky Information,Why and How We Communication: The Role of Motivation,"The goal of this experiment is to investigate how people with different Motivational Types process substance abuse public service announcements (PSAs) and pictures of risky products. Recent research by Lang and colleagues proposed and validated MAM, the motivational activation measure, which measures positivity offset and negativity bias. Lang developed measures of positivity offset (PO) and negativity bias (NB) and demonstrated that they are normally distributed, correlate significantly with personality variables (e.g. sensation seeking), substance use, and physiological indicators of appetitive and aversive activation. She further argued that by crossing PO and NB one might characterize individuals on the basis of their motivational activation or motivation type. She suggested that those high in PO and low in NB could be called risk takers, those low in PO and high in NB would be risk avoiders. Those high in both are called coactives and those low in both are called inactives (Lang, Shin, & Lee, 2004). Those low in one might have high PO and high NB, high PO and low NB, low PO and high NB, and low PO and low NB.
This study uses MAM to sort participants into their motivational types and then looks for differences in how these groups process messages about risky behavior and products."

The framing analysis of media coverage of the crisis and organization materials confirmed the assumptions of conflict theory and the contingency theory variables influencing the organizations conflict strategy. Nevertheless, the study found that a third party, the investigative media, played a key role in the evolution of a high-profile public health crisis that challenged strategic conflict management."
2005-0133,A Qualitative Analysis of Smoking Behavior in Kentucky,Health Communication Poster Session,Health Communication,,,Paper,A Qualitative Analysis of Smoking Behavior in Kentucky,Health Communication Poster Session,"Smoking is culturally, economically, and politically rooted in the tobacco-growing state of Kentucky. This study attempts to understand smoking behavior in Kentucky by considering the interaction between individual and contextual factors. The ecological perspective is employed to guide this study. Shorter one-on-one interviews with ten smokers have been implemented in Kentucky. Interview results noted that the smoking norm in Kentucky, family use of cigarettes, peer influence, business manipulation, and personal habits and nicotine addiction are factors which participants identified to pertain to their smoking behavior. Given that smoking in Kentucky is a phenomenon influenced by the interaction between individual and contextual factors, this study therefore suggests that people better not blame for any individuals smoking behavior by portraying it as a lifestyle choice. Instead, public health practitioners and researchers need to consider the impact of social context (e.g., social, political and economic factors) on smokers behavior when they develop any interventions to help smokers change their smoking behavior. Most importantly, future studies on smoking need to develop more explicit theories drawing from the perspectives of humanities, human ecology, or political economy."

Two hundred and forty nine Arabs in the Portland metropolitan area were surveyed to determine the motives for watching Arabic satellite channels and to map out their general media viewership. News programs and Al Jazeera news channel are the genre of choice for the majority of Arab Americans who have access to Arabic satellite channels.

All of the 307 total participants were students in undergraduate communication courses at four universities, two of which were located in each region: a small university in western North Dakota, a mid-sized university in eastern North Dakota, a mid-sized university in northeastern New Jersey, and a large university in New York City. The Rathus Assertiveness Schedule, (RAS; Rathus, 1973) was the instrument used to conduct this study. Results indicated that there is a significant difference in the self-reported assertiveness between the two regions. Participants from the New York Metropolitan region reported engaging in considerably more assertive communication than did the respondents from the Upper Midwest, with mean assertiveness scores of 1.64 and 13.89, respectively. Also, it was determined that there is a significant difference in self-reported assertiveness by gender, but only in the Upper Midwest where males reported higher levels of assertive communication than females."

We hypothesized that indirectness has (a) a negative association with the perceived negativity of irritations, intimacy, and self uncertainty; (b) a positive association with relationship uncertainty; (c) a positive association with partner uncertainty that is mediated by relationship uncertainty; and (d) a negative association with a partners interference that is mediated by the perceived negativity of irritations. We conducted a web-based survey in which individuals in romantic associations reported on their relationships and recent irritations. Structural equation modeling, which evaluated all of the predictor variables simultaneously, indicated support for all of our hypotheses. Results also replicated Solomon and Knoblochs test of the relational turbulence model. We discuss the implications for understanding both communicative indirectness and turbulence within developing dating relationships."

Experiment 1 (N = 32) shows positive effects of physical embodiment on the feeling of an agents social presence, the evaluation of the agent, the assessment of public opinion on the agent, and the evaluation of the interaction with the agent. A path analysis reveals that the feeling of the agents social presence mediates the participants evaluation of the social agent. Experiment 2 (N = 32) shows that physical embodiment with restricted tactile interaction causes null or even negative effects in human-agent interaction. In addition, Experiment 2 indicates that lonely people feel higher social presence of social agents, and provide more positive social responses to social agents than non-lonely people. The importance of physical embodiment and tactile communication in human-agent interaction and diverse role of social robots, especially for the lonely population, are discussed."

We reviewed two lines of research that aim to further develop the theory: (1) the effort to integrate transactive memory theory and public goods theory, and (2) the effort to develop task-expertise-people match in organizations. Empirical research is summarized around six themes: (a) preliminary support of the theory, (b) the role of communication, (c) expertise distribution and recognition, (d) the impacts of training on transactive memories, (e) transactive processes and finally (f) social relations and transactive memories. Problems with extant TM theorization and empirical measurement and research are examined and discussed. The paper ends with a discussion on several areas of research worthy of future attention, including reformulation of the theory, empirical measurement, distinguishing connective and communal TM systems, and TM system optimization.

Choosing Partners in the Online Dating Market,"Top Eight Papers in Communication and Technology, Part 1","This study examines the use of the marketplace metaphor in online dating environments, in which participants ""sell"" themselves and ""shop"" for romantic partners. We explore implications of this metaphor for how participants assess the attractiveness and honesty of potential romantic partners and determine their own ""worth"" in this venue. Thirty-four individuals active on a large online dating site participated in in-depth telephone interviews about their experiences and perceptions. Qualitative data analysis revealed that the marketplace perspective is salient for participants and that it influenced their decision-making strategies, assessment of others and their own desirability. We draw upon research in interpersonal communication, computer-mediated communication, and economic theory to understand the ways in which economic principles such as supply and demand apply to the online dating context and discuss implications for relationship initiation and online dating site design."

Extraversion, one trait from the Big Five personality model was examined here. The study surveyed 198 users and measured both online extraversion and offline extraversion. Online extraversion was significantly higher than offline extraversion. A structural model was built to explain the difference. Current data supported the hypotheses that online extraversion can be explained by offline extraversion, and online social support. Additionally, offline extraversion acted through online social self-efficacy. Online social self-efficacy also acted through online social outcome expectations to affect perceptions of online social support. Internet self-efficacy acted through online social self-efficacy and online social outcome expectations to affect online social support, which finally affected online extraversion."

One feature common to most reality television programs is direct address, where characters on the program gaze directly into the camera and, in essence, speak directly to the viewer at home. Previous research has shown that the use of this feature in other programming genres has the ability to affect how viewers rate a program's content. Moreover, research has also shown that this feature has the potential to foster stronger parasocial bonds between viewers and the characters on screen. Using both self-report and psychophysiological measures, this study examines the effect of this feature on viewers' attention and emotional response to this feature."

Since the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement with the tobacco companies, millions of tobacco company dollars have been provided to state and national anti-tobacco campaigns. The Minnesota-based anti-tobacco campaign Target Market uses the concepts of teen rebellion and resentment to combat the tobacco industry messages and influence, and gives teens a new target for those feelings  the tobacco companies. Eighteen ads which comprised the entire Target Market television ad campaign from 2000-2002 were analyzed. The descriptive findings from this analysis provide insights into the central themes, credibility of spokespersons, emotional appeals, and arguments presented during the campaign. Results of this study are vitally important because smoking among teenagers is at the highest level ever."

It describes the GLAAD's anti-Eminem campaign, analyzes the motivations behind that campaign's emphasis on the supposed links between homophobic lyrics and actual violence, and argues that the lack of community participation in the campaign is evidence that the organizations of the gay and lesbian movement are increasingly concerned with their own media positioning at the expense of the creation of informed public debate about issues of concern to sexual minorities."

Pluralistic ignorance has been offered as an explanation for binge drinking, sexual behavior, and reactions to emergency situations. Study 1 (N = 234) showed that, on average, students were personally less comfortable with the amount of drinking near campus than the average undergraduate, but that the size of this discrepancy decreased as student prototypicality increased. Further, and importantly, the same pattern was found on perceptions of the typicality of drinking for self and other undergraduates, as well as self-reported drinking behavior. Study 2 (N = 39) showed that people report personal levels of drinking in excess of some campus sub-groups. Study 3 (N = 91) manipulated the ingroup norm (party vs. academic) and asked participants to indicate how many standard drinks they consume per week. The more prototypical male participants considered themselves, the more they reported drinking in the party condition, and the less they reported in the academic condition. The data are consistent with self-categorization theory, and difficult to reconcile with the pluralistic ignorance hypothesis."

Perhaps the most interesting result of the ubiquity of the practice is that what formerly might have provoked a blanket negative reaction now draws a range of responses. Through surveys and short interviews, I explore how individuals in various positions within the music industry, including independent label owners and musicians, as well as serious fans conceive of song licensing and how they distinguish appropriate from inappropriate uses of popular music in television commercials."

A content analysis of 1,558 stories was conducted to examine the coverage of the War on Iraq and the Asian conflicts involving Pakistan and Indias tussle over Kashmir, the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, the Muslim separatist movement in the southern Philippine province of Mindanao, and the Aceh and Maluku civil wars in Indonesia. Based on Galtungs (1986, 1998) war/peace journalism framework, the results show that the Asian newspapers used a war journalism frame in covering regional conflicts but deployed a peace journalism frame in covering the War on Iraq. Hard news stories were dominated by war journalism framing, while features and opinion pieces were dominated by peace journalism framing. Foreign-sourced stories from wire services contained more war journalism frames and fewer peace journalism frames than locally-produced stories written by the newspapers own correspondents."

The present study provides such assessments. Participants (N = 253) were native-born Chinese attending a major Chinese university enrolling students from all major cities and provinces of the country. These participants responded to a detailed, Chinese-language questionnaire that assessed (a) the value placed on emotional support skills, (b) goals typically pursued in emotional support situations, and (c) evaluations of different coping strategies for providing emotional support, and (d) perceptions of the sensitivity of different comforting messages. Results indicated that whereas Chinese women rated emotional support skills as more important than Chinese men, women and men differed only occasionally in their evaluations of the perceived appropriateness of different support goals and the perceived effectiveness of different support strategies and messages. These results are compared to those obtained in previous research with samples of Americans and sojourning Chinese."

In the past, academic scholarship concerning the role of telecenters has treated these facilities as tools to rebalance the marginalization of the less advantaged. For example, telecenters have been studied as methods to help balance the digital divide between the citizens of developing and developed countries. Though telecenter scholars agree that ICT facilities have the potential to empower technologically disadvantaged communities, there is a shift in the academic discussion that indicates a need for more qualitative research during the preliminary stages of telecenter development. In an effort to perform the type of needs assessment telecenter research scholars are starting to address, this project attempts to examine the current role of ICT in the lives of people living in a developing country. Specifically, this study begins to investigate what role ICT play in the lives of citizens living in Belize, a young country located on the northwest flanks of the Caribbean. By taking a qualitative approach, this study will support the argument that performing qualitative needs assessments will better produce insightful, and personalized data about the existing uses and future needs of ICT in the community. Additionally, by examining what role ICT play in Belizean life, this study will contribute to the scholarly conversation about how telecenters will best be utilized in the future social and economic development of Third World countries."

Specifically, the findings reveal two major gaps and tensions in foundation and grantee understandings of foundation communication, focusing on perceptions of appropriate (a) uses of foundation voices, and (b) models of foundation-grantee communication. First, foundation directors describe their organizations as having limited or nonexistent public voices, while grantees expect foundations to actively use their voices to advocate for and improve the conditions of nonprofit interests. Second, foundations are described as employing monologic (one way public information) models of communication, while grantees and some foundation directors articulate a need for dialogic (two way) models of communication. Implications for the communicative study of legitimacy and foundation communication based on these findings are discussed."

Such culturally sanctioned issues and practices, over which women have little or no control, increase womens vulnerability to HIV infection and need to be addressed and discouraged in the PSAs. I assess the effectiveness of televised PSAs based on the theoretical constructs of Wittes (1992) Extended Parallel Process Model. Through a survey of 200 adults and through focus group discussions with adults in the capital city of Harare, I ascertain the impact of PSAs on the Zimbabwean audience.
Results show no coverage of sociocultural issues that play a role in HIV transmission. Results however, show a high level of exposure to PSAs among the sample. In terms of PSA effectiveness, the analyzed PSAs do not induce the recommended levels of threat and efficacy, are not well targeted, and do not realistically depict HIV/AIDS. Despite this however, there is a positive and significant relationship between exposure to PSAs and intention to practice safe sex. This suggests that with improved message production, mass mediated messages can be a powerful ally in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Besides offering suggestions for future research, implications of the results for the design of more effective PSAs are explored."

Credibility was measured on a semantic differential scale, with two constituent factors: trustworthiness and expertise. Data were analyzed using a 2 (country) x 3 (excuses) x 2 (format) factorial ANOVA.
The results of the study reveal that nationality is the most significant predictor of evaluations of trustworthiness and expertise. Spanish subjects found excuses offered by a fictitious corporation less credible than American subjects. Results of the study indicate that issuing an excuse in an advertisement or within the context of a news story makes no difference in corporate credibility. This finding implies that organizations wishing to have complete control of their message may wish to choose advertising as a vehicle for delivering their advocacy message."

Exploring the Role of the Ethnic Press,"Race, Ethnicity, & Media","New York City has witnessed an explosion of new immigrant groups within the past 30 years, and with it has come a rebirth of the nations ethnic and immigrant newspapers. This study uses a case study comparison to explore the role of four ethnic and immigrant newspapers through content analysis and online interviews with the newspapers publishers. The findings suggest that the ethnic and immigrant newspapers may do more to help define and unify ethnic and immigrant groups than to help them ""adapt"" to a new culture, as previous research has suggested."

A Standard Model framework focusing on stages of reception, processing, and response was used to create, implement, and evaluate the intervention. Participants were interviewed by phone during three waves: baseline, following year 1 of the intervention, and following year two of the intervention. Results indicate a gain in reception over the course of the intervention. Increases in attitudes, control beliefs, intentions, and self-reported behavior were found between baseline and the first year of the intervention, and were maintained (though not increased) during the second year of the intervention. Strengths and weaknesses of the intervention are viewed through the scope of the Standard Model."
2005-0164,A Straight Twist on Queer Reality: A Critical Discussion of Bravos Boy Meets Boy,Role Call: Queer Media Representations,"Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Studies",,,Paper,A Straight Twist on Queer Reality: A Critical Discussion of Bravos Boy Meets Boy,Role Call: Queer Media Representations,"When Bravo first announced its upcoming program, Boy Meets Boy, which aired during the summer of 2003, a flurry of anticipation poured forth from media commentators, gay activists and curious spectators-to-be. Heralded as television's first gay dating reality show, this six-week program was a cross between Joe Millionaire and The Bachelor. Yet, unlike other dating shows that focus on sexuality, the promos for Boy Meets Boy focused on a twist in the plot  some of the suitors were straight.
This paper takes a critical approach to examining stereotypical portrayals of gay characters on the popular television show, Boy Meets Boy. I argue that this attempt at blurring the line between straight and gay social identities and moving toward a greater social acceptance actually reinforces two prominent stereotypes of gay men - the gay as butt of joke/comic relief and the de-sexualized gay. Using interviews and observations from two local discussion groups and a national on-line discussion group, a qualitative dialogue of the show in terms of stereotyping and visibility was created.
Both the local discussion groups and the on-line discussion board focused mainly on the twist; comments from the local groups were more negatively-sided than those the board. Based on this collection of responses, I conclude that although Boy Meets Boy has many redeeming qualities and may have been created with the best of intentions, the show inevitably came off to some as reinforcing stereotypes."

The results indicate that this network is very sparse; 42 nations had no conflict, and 36 only one bilateral disagreement. The network is centered by Yugoslavia (Serbia), Russia, the United States, Iraq and China. Most conflicts are regional. The paper evaluates both the liberal and realist (including Huntingtons Clash of Civilizations Theory) perspectives as predictors of conflict. The results indicate that while both paradigms significantly predict conflict, neither is a very good predictor. A multiple regression model including permanent UN Security Council membership, physical proximity, whether or not a nation was a democracy, bilateral telecommunication and trade (imports and exports), and political alliances accounted for only 4.3% of the variance in the structure of international conflict, in spite of the fact that each variable was significantly related to conflict. The need for further research is discussed."
2005-0166,A Structuralist's Lament: Questioning the Dialogue Between Young Americans and Politics,Community and Civic Life,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,A Structuralist's Lament: Questioning the Dialogue Between Young Americans and Politics,Community and Civic Life,"This paper examines low youth civic engagement in American politics. Investigating the language of young Americans about politics and political involvement, this paper suggests that the problems with low voter turnout and political engagement is not because politics isnt cool. Rather, this paper suggests that young people seek a clearer dialogue with politics, a more coeherent understanding of the structure behind political systems in the country. Drawing from focus groups comprised of young people from around the country, this paper does a rhetorical analysis of their words. Three categories emerge: efficacy, images of incomplete journeys, and predictability. Each of these categories can be answered, this paper suggests, by a more direct portrayal of the structuralism inherent in politics. Young people, instead of asking their politicians to look more like them, are asking their politicians to make more sense. Because there is a break in communication between the structure of politics and the understanding of youth, there is no drive to engage in politics. Instead, youth volunteer for civic organizations with the expectations that results, as they understand them, will be immediate. The paper ends with a call for a more clear and concise dialogue between the political powers-that-be and young Americans."

This study, part of a systematic program of research, seeks to clarify the Thai communication behaviors associated with intercultural communication effectiveness. The fundamental interaction consciousness Thais exhibit, a condition compatible with rhetorical sensitivity, makes Thailand a laboratory for intercultural communication study. This study clarifies previous findings with respect to rhetorical sensitivity and willingness to communicate. The relatively low initial Thai willingness to communicate may be characteristic of rhetorical reflection employed early in a relationship to collect information upon which to build rhetorical sensitivity. Therefore, the study involves two hypotheses: Thais will display higher rhetorical reflector traits in short-term relationships than in long-term relationships; and, Thais will display higher rhetorical sensitivity in long-term relationships than in short-term relationships. Undergraduate students from Mahidol and Bangkok Universities in Thailand (N=400) generated data using the THAIRHETSEN instrument. The results do not support the first hypothesis, but support the second hypothesis. Post hoc investigation of U.S. American rhetorical sensitivity behavior displays a tendency for the development of noble self behavior as a relationship history evolves. The paper concludes with a description of the studys limitations and presents suggestions for additional research."

This study attempts to comprehend the reality and the ways of the press suppression by examining various historical records such as press laws, cases and statistical data during this period. This study found that the approval of national newspapers or the alleged expansion of press freedom, as part of so-called 'Cultural Rule', was controlled completely by press laws or internal guidelines. In fact, the ways Japanese ruling authorities manipulated the colonial press was not essentially different from those of the 1910's, when Sword Rule' prevailed. The increasing number of press law clauses and arrests of journalists, suggests that the pressure on the media rather got worse than before. Consequently, the 'Cultural Rule' that Japanese ruling authorities claimed to stand for, was nothing but a deceptive policy, which served the purpose of the long-term stabilization of the colonial system by appeasing pubic anger and oppressing the national independence movements. Unlike previous studies on the topic, this study is characterized by an attempt to analyze the Japanese press control through an examination of concrete press law clauses, cases, and their practical application, such as the number of arrests."

RIAS was used to micro-analyze physicians and patients talk patterns. It was found that physicians and patients talk patterns were highly asymmetrical. Physicians asked almost all the questions (25.47%), mostly close-ended whereas patients asked very few questions (3.21%). Patients initiated a fair amount of psychosocial exchange (25.48%) which was not reciprocated by physicians (4.26%). Physicians spent about a quarter of their time on facilitation remarks (24.74%) which, unfortunately were negatively correlated (r =-.44) with patient overall satisfaction. Physician close-ended questions were negatively correlated with patient overall satisfaction (r = -.50), with patient affective satisfaction (r = -.50), with patient expertise satisfaction (r = -.43) and with patient communication satisfaction (r = -.44). Contrary to previous research done in the United States and Europe, Canadian physicians psychosocial talk was not significantly correlated with patient satisfaction. It can be argued that increasing physicians psychosocial talk may not be the key toward patient satisfaction. As long as physicians do not exert tight control over the process and content of the conversation by constant close-ended questions and facilitation remarks, leaving some room for patients to say what they need to say, patients may not be dissatisfied. Male and female patients did not talk differently with male physicians but male physicians facilitated female patients more than male patients."

As a replication of Kingsley and Park (2004), the current study tests the prediction ability of Equity Theory for inequity in workplace friendships. In addition to the replication, the study tests two basic tenets of Equity Theory: peoples equity restoration attempts in inequitable situations and the role of emotion in peoples responses to inequitable situations. Also, it tests the theory in a non-U. S. culture.
Korean participants reported a greater level of anger in the underreward situation than in the overreward situation, while Americans reported a greater level of anger in the overreward situation than in the underreward situation. Further, Koreans were more likely to ask their partners to change their behavior in underreward than in overreward situations, while Americans were more likely to do so in overreward than in underreward situations. Koreans were more likely to change their own behaviors in overreward than in underreward situations, while Americans were more likely to do so in underreward than in overreward situations. Also, Koreans were more likely to decrease their liking for their partner in underreward than in overreward situations, while Americans were more likely to do so in overreward than in underreward situations. Duty of the overrewarded versus the underrewarded party to restore equity is suggested as an explanation for the interaction between nation and type of inequity."

This study identified three factors-environmental, relational, and strategic public relations factors to affect national image of other countries in a target country's news media. It tested how these three factors are related to the prominence and valence of 157 countries in US newspaper and television news coverage (New York Times, Washington Post, ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN) during 2002. This study found that three factors were significant predictors on total newspaper articles, newspaper prominence, and total television stories. Specifically, national traits and political significance were positively related to most prominence measures, while deviance, economic significance, and cultural significance had mixed findings. Communication constraints had no significant relationship with prominence. Strategic public relations turned out to be a significant predictor on newspaper prominence, but not on newspaper total articles controlling for environmental and relational factors. Deviance was negatively related to news valence. In contrast, strategic public relations had no significant relationship with valence."

By exploring the rhetorical effects of Korean child prostitutes in western geography of imagination and the nationalist stance of Korean societies, I argue that both western and Korean males willingly put a paternalistic burden on their shoulders and reinforce their inheritance of power and knowledge. On the one hand, I will examine how young third-world women function in a process of western knowledge production. On the other hand, I will investigate the process of how young Korean women are re-domesticated through nationalist responses to the knowledge production in the West. From the outside, they seem hostile and opposite to each other. By making female bodies an object to domesticate and sustaining the power to get hold of them, however, they are in compliance with each other."

Two hundred thirty three adult sibling dyads were recruited. In general, results showed that having at least one sibling in a dyad with a secure attachment style is beneficial for interdependence, breadth/depth of interactions, commitment, and predictability between the siblings. Furthermore, having a sibling with a dismissive attachment style tends to be detrimental to the same variables."

First, through a positional analysis of discourse and events, the relationships between the values that inform our democratic practices and the assumptions behind our goals for national security are brought into conversation. Then, a shift to McPhails non-argumentative rhetoric, as it would theoretically inform Laclau and Mouffes democratic imaginary, is presented as a socially transformative alternative to our current national discourse. Finally, the results of such a transformative shift are exemplified by the proposals of visionary biophysicist and energy resource consultant Amory Lovins. These proposals offer us multilateral, nonviolent modes of formulating counterterrorism policies which fulfill our needs for domestic and global security, without sacrificing civil liberties or human rights."
2005-0175,Attribution and Interpersonal Control Strategies in Couples Including One Depressed Individual,Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Attribution and Interpersonal Control Strategies in Couples Including One Depressed Individual,Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,"This investigation explores the ways partners in relationship with a depressed individual interpret the depressive behavior and how this interpretation is related to their types of attempts to control depression and to relationship satisfaction and cohesiveness. Within the context of Inconsistent Nurturing as Control theory (Le Poire, 1994) and attribution for control within the relationship (internal or external), the current investigation describes the paradoxical nature of the power structure in the romantic relationship with a depressed individual, and how the power structure limits the types of control strategies the non-depressed partner can use. Couples including one depressed individual (N=148 individuals) are interviewed and compared to a control group of non-depressed couples (N =68 individuals). Results indicate that individuals with higher external attribution for control feel their partners behavior is unpredictable and not influenced by what they say or use fewer strategies to curtail depression and instead use more strategies that reinforce depression and punish alternative behavior. In couples including one depressed individual, poorer mental health and internal attribution for control is associated with more cohesiveness but less relational satisfaction. Greater mental health and external attribution in couples including one depressed individual predicts less cohesiveness but more relational satisfaction. This pattern does not hold for control group couples, who reported more cohesiveness and relational satisfaction as they reported more internal attribution for control; control group couples reported less cohesiveness and relational satisfaction as they reported more external attribution for control. Implications for control dynamics and communication strategies are discussed."

The HHI, an objective measurement for market concentration, showed that the wireless service market would become highly concentrated nationwide (HHI > 2,100 with 555 points increase) possibly giving market power to the newly combined firm. However, less definite assessment can be made for other criteria, such as the decreasing number of wireless service providers and its greater impact in rural areas. Further investigation is needed for the relationship between the decreasing number of competitors and the presence of meaningful economic competition"

This paper explores the diversity policy considerations that have been raised in connection with the LPM introduction and examines whether the LPM represents a legitimate threat to source and content diversity, or whether the diversity principle has been largely co-opted in support of the economic and strategic considerations of certain industry stakeholders. This paper also addresses the broader question of whether the audience measurement industry should be subjected to more rigorous government oversight."

This is arguably an important component of the values defining the political culture of the United States. The paper examines coverage of three instances of human rights disasters to demonstrate how the mass media provide flexible rationales for and against US intervention in human rights disasters and thereby reinforce an important component of post-cold war support for US primacy.

It focuses on three main questions; (1) to which cultural identity did the girl primarily orient herself (2) with what communication style did she interact in the Korean community;(3) how did she adapt her communication style to the Korean culture? The main subject was a 17-year old Korean American girl living in a southern coastal city in the United States. In-depth interviews of both the informant and her mother revealed bicultural orientations. In other words, the 17-year old girl considers herself as both an American who is familiar with Korean culture and a Korean who is familiar with American culture. Her discourse, however, shows the dominance of an American identity. Additional studies are needed to further our understanding of how such an identity is constructed in everyday interactions."

Media Exposure and Political Trust in 21 Countries,Social Capital and Political Trust,"The low levels of electoral turnout during the last European elections have raised a debate around the increasing disengaged attitudes that citizens have been showing towards the political process in general. Explanations from political communication suggest some contrasting arguments around this issue that has been configured as a constant in the academic debate; the relationship between the mass media and political commitment. On one hand, we find authors that accuse the media and especially the negative presentation of politics of causing citizens disaffection. On the other hand, some recent analyses state that political information in the media  regardless of their tone  lead to an informed and engaged public. Taking the cited framework as the main reference, this article compares the connection between trust in parliamentary national institutions, as one of the dimensions of political disaffection, and the media in 21 European countries categorized in three groups: The western and northern countries, known as stable democracies with high levels of trust, the southern countries, known as rather disaffected and the young democracies in eastern Europe."

The findings suggest that the majority of media included in the study constructed her as Other by emphasizing her wealth, personal style, and worldliness. Evidence of Backlash against feminism was also present in much of the coverage, which likely served to further marginalize her in the minds of the audience."
2005-0182,Bad or Good Information? Quality Newspapers as Benchmark For the Assessment of Media Performance,tudies of Media in a Variety of National Settings,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Bad or Good Information? Quality Newspapers as Benchmark For the Assessment of Media Performance,Studies of Media in a Variety of National Settings,"To inform themselves about politics, people watch television, read the newspapers or listen to the radio. Since media may influence political processes, both scientists and politicians call for responsible and top quality media coverage. In contrast to media coverage in television, radio broadcasting is barely researched. To minimize the shortfall in research, this paper focuses on the performance of the national radio channel Deutschlandfunk. The study concentrates not only on the analysis of information quality in Deutschlandfunk but also on methodological aspects: usability of media coverage in the four German quality newspapers as a benchmark for information quality. The comparison between the so called German quality newspapers (national newspapers with high standards in quality) and other media types is a sub-form of Inter-media-comparisons. In German research, it is very common to use the quality newspapers (Frankfurter Rundschau, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung und Die Welt) as a benchmark.
The radio channel Deutschlandfunk is regulated by public law and therefore bound to objective and well-balanced information. The main finding of this study is, that the Deutschlandfunk did not meet its obligations since the channel did not inform its audience well-balanced. On the methodological aspect the study shows that the quality newspaper benchmark is a useful approach when assessing media performance. All types of media can be assessed in relation to the same benchmark. This enables the comparison of media quality between different types of media."

In order to cater for the needs of its audiences in the different regions of the world, the service provides a regional slant to its news, thus, localizing the news for the region. This study compares BBC Televisions world news about Africa broadcast to the American and African audiences, to determine which African stories are broadcast to the American audience and the factors that affect the selection of such stories. The findings however show that the BBC broadcasts fewer stories about Africa to both the African and American audiences. In addition to that, it was observed that there is a tendency for the target audience and the political system of an African country to influence the valence of an African news story."

Employing computer-assisted text analysis, this study suggested that most of the highly frequent concepts from the mission statements were related to corporate social responsibility, which could be clustered into two levels of responsibility: economic/legal and ethical/philanthropic responsibility (Carroll, 1991; 1999). This study also revealed that fair business practice was the most prominently presented category of corporate social responsibility in the mission statements from the Fortune 100 companies web sites. Theoretic and pragmatic implications of the findings were discussed."

Using psychological scales measuring femininity and masculinity embedded in social contexts can provide a rich vector of data that can help us understand only differences between men and women, but among women, for example. According to this perspective, gender roles manifest differently in different contexts for some women, and contribute to their self-conceptions, associations, and behaviour. With data on the salience of gendered traits across various contexts, social scientists can increase understanding of the role of gender in their quantitative explorations of issues like gender differences in message comprehension, knowledge acquisition, and information-seeking."
2005-0186,Beyond Cognition: Influence of Presidential Campaign News on Voters' Perception and Judgment,Cognitive Effects of the Mass Media,Political Communication,,,Paper,Beyond Cognition: Influence of Presidential Campaign News on Voters' Perception and Judgment,Cognitive Effects of the Mass Media,"This study examines the influence of news coverage of presidential campaigns on voters perception and decision-making about the campaigns and their presidential candidates. From the perspective of the large media effects model, this study looked at what campaign issues salient in news stories were also important to voters (agenda setting effect) and how the descriptions about presidential candidates in the news affected voters criteria for candidate choice (attribute priming effect). For these purposes, this study conducted comprehensive content analyses of network television newscasts and survey data analyses of the National Election Studies to compare news content and public opinion regarding the 1992 and 2000 presidential elections. This study found remarkably strong correlations between campaign issues in the news and voters national agendas, and between the news descriptions of the presidential candidates and voters criteria for candidate selection. The results imply that news coverage of presidential campaigns have significant influence on voters perception about nationally important issues and their image and judgments about their presidential candidates. In addition, those media effects were found to be stronger particularly for new and winning candidates, which provides an underlying psychological explanation about media influence."
2005-0201,Beyond Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Internalized Extrinsic Motivation in the Promotion of Learning Among Primary School Students,Top Four Papers in Instructional Communication,Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,Beyond Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Internalized Extrinsic Motivation in the Promotion of Learning Among Primary School Students,Top Four Papers in Instructional Communication,"Motivating is essentially a communicative process. Researchers have previously attributed learning to either intrinsic or extrinsic motivations and provided teachers with many guidelines in promoting learning in school. However it is still widely documented that while children are highly interested in learning and intrinsically motivated when they enter primary school, their motivation in learning declined steadily from the 3rd grade to the 8th grade.

This paper critically examines the existing dialogue among theorists on the respective merits of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and identifies a set of causes of students declining interests in learning. More importantly, this paper points out the previously neglected concept of internalized motivation and proposes a longitudinal experiment to explore the effect of internalized motivation on learning."

Past research suggests both a positive and null effect between video game play and aggression. The current research explores how gaming environment (VR, standard console, and watching), game type (fighting, shooting, and racing), and competitor (person and CPU agent) influence levels of presence, arousal, and short-term hostility measured as aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, and aggressive feelings. In addition to game environment influencing perceived presence, results indicate the interaction between game environment and game type significantly influences aggressive behavior and thoughts and arousal. Finally, competitor and game environment interact to influence aggressive feelings."
2005-0203,Beyond the False Dichotomy of the Modern and Postmodern: Strategies for Indigenous Critical Communication Studies in Korea,Communication and Media Studies in Asia,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Beyond the False Dichotomy of the Modern and Postmodern: Strategies for Indigenous Critical Communication Studies in Korea,Communication and Media Studies in Asia,"The failure to indigenize imported social theories in Korea affords precious theoretical insights for the future of critical communication studies. Since Korean society has evolved out of a mixture of the pre-modern, postcolonial, modern and postmodern elements, attempts to rigidly graft modern and postmodern theories onto Korean society have ensured that both theories remain unfinished projects in Korea. This paper argues that contributions from both camps are still feasible and imperative modes of indigenizing social inquiry in Korea. Theorizing the social still requires comprehensive structural analyses and constructive ideals of progress, as well as insights into subject formation that grant social agency to individuals. As the Korean example illustrates well, critical communication studies must transcend the false dichotomies of modern vs. postmodern to answer specific concerns and problems facing a given society today."
2005-0204,Big Brother: a Multimedia Television Format ; Influence of Persons and Emotions in Content on Attention,Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Big Brother: a Multimedia Television Format ; Influence of Persons and Emotions in Content on Attention,Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,The multimedia format Big Brother spread across the world within a few years. The popularity of the format lies in the business model it is based on. Ad revenues of both TV and internet serve as financial base for the broadcasters. However broadcasters have little insight in how TV content can stimulate the web visits of a internet site. The main question of this paper is how TV content affects viewers zapping and surfing behaviour. For this purpose TV content data were combined with data from the people meter and data of the internet use. The results of the research indicate that the combination of emotions and persons in a real life format as Big Brother directly effects the zapping behaviour. And also how TV content is a crucial driver for the Big Brother web site use.
2005-0205,Boundaries in Genetic Research: Toward a Dialogic Interactive Bioethics,Conference Theme Competitive Interactive Papers: Questioning the Dialogue,Theme Sessions,,,Paper,Boundaries in Genetic Research: Toward a Dialogic Interactive Bioethics,Conference Theme Competitive Interactive Papers: Questioning the Dialogue,"The findings of the Human Genome Project and other initiatives within genomics have produced useful knowledge about human origins, interrelatedness, and population variations. However, these findings are also challenging historical and traditional ways that various ethnic and racial groups define themselves and their histories, thus leading to resistance among some groups to these genetic research projects. It is not yet known how these projects will precisely impact various ethnic groups; however, it is clear that a number of ethics issues are increasingly salient. The objective of this paper is to establish a need for a dialogic bioethics perspective. This argument is supported by the presentation of data from a random sample survey concerning the relationship between racial/ethnic self-identification, religious identification, attitudes toward science and attitudes toward genomics. It was found that people who self identify into different racial and ethnic groups differ significantly in their attitudes toward genomics. Religious identification had no relation to attitudes toward genomics, however, attitudes toward science did impact attitudes toward genomics. These findings can be used to further develop a perspective to guide empirical research projects surrounding communication and ethics problems found in the advancement of genetic research. Furthermore, these findings help support an argument for a program of interactive bioethics from a dialogic perspective. While maintaining a distinct focus on dialogue as a guiding principle, this paper spans scholarship in political communication, cultural and intercultural communication, and health communication. It is also relevant to scholars and practitioners outside of communication such as in genomics."

Following the analysis of 1990-era slasher movies by Sapolsky, Molitor, and Luque (2003), this study considers nine mean girl movies released between 1989 and 1999. The gender distribution of victimization by lethal attacks is identical to that of slashers, but the pattern in display of victims fear is nearly reversed: where slashers show females in fear more, mean girl movies spend look longer at males in fear. Mean girl movies represent a development of slasher themes of male sexual predation and female empowerment in self defense. Mean girl movies also root this conflict more fully in the day-to-day lives of ordinary girls: high school, dating, and competition. As such, this recent Hollywood cycles offers a vivid depiction of girl empowered and boys reduced to jokes."
2005-0207,Brazilian Wireless Telephony - The Eclipse of Competition,Governing Media Industries,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Brazilian Wireless Telephony - The Eclipse of Competition,Governing Media Industries,"In 2003, as Brazilian mobile telephone usage overtook fixed line usage for the first time, wireless telephony demonstrated that it could carry the burden of boosting Brazils teledensity. Reforms in the wireless sector focused on maximizing foreign direct investment at privatization. Although introducing competition to wireline services was a stated goal of reformers, avoiding the creation of a domestic monopolist was a more important goal. Despite careful attention paid by reformers to the sector, conditions for effective competition have not emerged. This paper considers the post-privatization dynamics of Brazils market for mobile cellular telephony, which is already the largest in Latin America and the Caribbean, and likely to grow further. It provides an historical account of the consolidation of the national Brazilian wireless sector into a market oligopoly, and presents factors contributing to market consolidation."

Our studies manipulated vulnerability to a health risk and argument quality in an action recommendation. The main dependent measures were attitudes, intentions, behavior, and cognitive responses. The findings support our main hypothesis. In Experiment 1, participants who felt vulnerable to a health risk processed the action recommendation with a systematic positive bias, resulting in increased persuasion regardless of argument quality. Experiment 2 showed that the induction of a positive mood attenuated this bias, resulting in more objective systematic processing."

Data were collected from adolescent females and adult females across four counties in Michigan. A total of 10 focus groups (N=91) were conducted ranging 6 to 14 participants per group. Data was analyzed using a coding scheme based on the Health Belief Model and knowledge categories. Participants responses to focus group questions (N= 5,174) revealed beliefs about severity, susceptibility, self efficacy, and response efficacy as well as knowledge statements pertaining to breast cancer, nutrition, activity, environment, and the role of government and industry. Chi-square analyses were conducted to examine the distribution of statements across categories between adult females and adolescent females. Specifically, adolescent females reported more beliefs about efficacy issues and the susceptibility of others to breast cancer than mothers. Mothers made more statements regarding breast cancer knowledge, environmental factors, and the role of government and industry as it relates to breast cancer. Representative qualitative comments also are selected as examples of themes that resonated within each category. Formative research is part of a larger process for developing health campaign messages and implications for message design are discussed."

Soap operas, television dramas, movies, and even comedies integrate health issues in a variety of ways to enrich plots, and sometimes with educational objectives (Brodie, et al., 2001; Howe, Owen-Smith & Richardson, 2002). For some programs, like doctor shows such as ER, health issues are naturally and frequently integrated into scripts (Brodie, et al., 2001; Turow, 1996). For other programs, health issues often come in the form of plots that have significant effects on a main character. This study is an audience analysis of discussion about Sex and the Citys breast cancer storyline on HBOs online message board. In the shows final season one of the four main characters, Samantha, was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer, which sparked numerous threads of conversation on the bulletin boards. Such audience analysis can help programmers and health communicators understand viewer response to health-related stories, the meaning these stories have for viewers beyond the on-screen narrative, and how they talk about it with each other."

Using telephone survey data from 240 Caucasian and 206 African American women, this study examines the relationships among anxiety about breast cancer, use of media, and perceptions of health information. The findings show that negative perceptions of breast cancer information led to greater anxiety about the disease for both groups of women; attention to television, radio, and magazines were significantly related to breast cancer anxiety for African American women, but not for Caucasian women; the effects of the media on breast cancer anxiety were mediated by negative perceptions of the health information for African American women. Also reviewed in the literature were factors of knowledge, health locus of control, spirituality and their relationships with anxiety about breast cancer, and characteristics of African Americans in processing health-related information."

These developments in their turn produced predictions of profound cultural and social change. This paper addresses the key issue of how British people are using, and likely to use, these new technologies and applications in their everyday lives. Data drawn from a large-scale British panel study which ran from 1996 to 2003 strongly suggest that the impact of the new has been less dramatic than predicted, and is an essentially evolutionary process than a revolutionary change. The medium of television survives well, despite fierce competition, reflecting the established roles of the medium and its content, and the affordances it can offer users."

Through an analysis of three congressional hearings on the topic, we show the way in which interested moral entrepreneurs use culturally-bound assumptions coupled with rhetorical strategies of building a moral panic to justify the need for extra regulation. We work in the ideas of moral risk and moral public dialogue to illustrate the emergence of a moral panic through interactive strategies of legitimation and contestation. We analyze how incidents of moral panic are characterized by statements that seek to rhetorically establish social consensus about the existence of a ubiquitous, endemic condition of symbolic pollution caused by typified perpetrators, condition that represents a moral risk for a category of typified victims. We also show several strategies of resistance to a moral panic construction. In the end, we draw several policy observations relevant for the future of indecency regulation."

If understood broadly, advocacy campaigns are applicable beyond engaging the news media to push for policy change, the so-called liberal advocacy campaigns. In the developing world, many NGOs have embraced advocacy as the path to more effective and strategic social change, incurring serious challenges on the authenticity of their advocacy claims. This paper prioritizes its analytical and critical dynamism on this pursuit the authentic voice of the grassroots, and proposes some well-developed participatory campaigns tools that might bring truly participatory and empowering advocacy campaigns in the future. It argues that theories and practices of advocacy have to adapt to the specific power structure with which development communication practitioners find themselves confronting. This paper has some considerable limitations. It mainly explores on the theoretical level the possibilities and problems of using advocacy in development initiatives in Southern countries. The paper itself is an advocacy for serious scholarly consideration on advocacy campaigns in the discipline of communication. Therefore, its targets are more institutional and structural, rather than tangible or case-specific; its discourse conceptual, rather than empirical."

Decomposing the Hostile Media Effect,Mass Communication Top Faculty Papers,"This field experiment examined theoretical and conceptual questions surrounding the hostile media effect  the perceptual bias in which partisans on a controversial issue tend to see news coverage of that issue as biased in favor of the other side. Using groups of partisans on opposite sides of the debate over genetically modified animals, we designed a test of the relative influence of author (journalist versus college student) and reach (mass media versus classroom composition) on perceptions of bias. We found main effects for both theoretical factors with no significant covariates or interactions. In addition, partisanship, a concept barely explored in this research arena, was composed of two dimensions  ego involvement and relevance. These two dimensions played distinctive roles in perceptions of hostile media content: low relevance drove differing perceptions of bias in the author conditions, while high ego involvement explained differing perceptions of bias in the reach conditions."

While a few studies have explored the effects of major news events (e.g., Ronald Reagans colon cancer surgery) on health information seeking, scholars have paid less attention to the effects of routine health-related news coverage on the general public. This study examines the relationship between cancer-related news coverage and information seeking using the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a national survey of adults aged 18 years and older. We developed a Lexis-Nexis search term to identify cancer-focused Associated Press (AP) news stories released between October 20th, 2002 and April 12th, 2003. Logistic regression models assessed the relationship between the number of cancer-focused AP news stories in the past week and the likelihood of cancer-related information seeking in the past week. We observed no overall effect of cancer-focused news coverage on cancer information seeking. However, among respondents who report paying attention to health-related news stories, we observed a significant effect of cancer-focused news coverage on information seeking. Results suggest that a notable segment of the population actively respond to periods of elevated cancer-focused news coverage by seeking additional information about cancer. However, findings also suggest that cancer information seeking does not vary by intensity of cancer-focused news coverage for the majority of the population. Implications for dissemination of prevention messages are discussed."
2005-0218,"Cancer Scanning and Seeking Behavior is Associated with Knowledge, Lifestyle Choices and Screening Behavior",formation Seeking and Uncertainty Management,Health Communication,,,Paper,"Cancer Scanning and Seeking Behavior is Associated with Knowledge, Lifestyle Choices and Screening Behavior",Information Seeking and Uncertainty Management,"Much previous research on cancer information gathering has focused on active seeking, missing that information which is gathered through routine media use or conversation (hereafter referred to as scanning). It is hypothesized that both scanning and active seeking influence decisions related to knowledge, prevention and screening.
This study uses data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) to describe cancer-related scanning and seeking behavior (SSB) and assess its relationship with knowledge, lifestyle behavior and screening. Based on questions about scanning (operationalized as amount of attention paid to health topics) and about searching for cancer information in the past year, a typology was created. Forty-one percent of respondents were low scan-no seekers; 31% high scan-no seekers; 10% low scan-seekers and 19% high scan-seekers.
When controlling for socio-demographic characteristics with multiple regression, both scanning and seeking were positively associated with knowledge about cancer (B=.175, p<.001; B=.092, p<.001) and lifestyle choices that may prevent cancer (B=.095, p<.001; B=.058, p<.001).
Logistic regression results revealed a significant association between both scanning and seeking and prostate cancer screening (OR=3.32, CI=1.99-5.53; OR=12.94, CI=4.4-38.0), as well as colonoscopy (OR= 1.32, CI=1.18-1.48; OR=1.57, CI=1.30-1.89). Scanning alone was associated with obtaining mammograms (OR=1.57, CI=1.34-1.85).
These results suggest that individuals who scan and/or seek cancer information are those who acquire knowledge, adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors and get screened for cancer. Causal claims about these associations await further research."

The findings suggest that the research on the effects of personality manifestations in computers may be considered as an important venue for better understanding of how the concept of social presence could be extended beyond the effect of social facilitation or mere presence effect. Second, the results suggest that computer agents which manifest cooperative personality may have positive effects not only on users performance but also on enhancing the user-interface relationship by fostering trust in the technology. Last but not least, the current study has important practical implications for developers and designers of education technologies. When computers and agent-based technologies are becoming more and more prominent as educational tools for both children and adults, the present findings suggest that casting of personality should be carefully studied and implemented with respect to designing educational software and applications."

The purpose of this framing study was to analyze how the traditional media covered the role of the Internet in the surfacing and early primary periods of the 2004 presidential campaign. It illuminated the amount and nature of the media attention lavished on Howard Deans short-lived bid for the White House and compared it to coverage of Internet campaigning by the other Democratic contenders and the Republican incumbent, President George W. Bush. Findings indicate online campaigning was rarely framed as an opportunity for individual voters to participate in a meaningful way. Instead, the media framed it as just another tactic used by those jockeying for position in the horse race."

Results from an Experiment in Abuja, Nigeria",Communication to Overcome Stigma,Health Communication,,,Paper,"Can Viewing an Entertainment-Education film change HIV-Related Risk and Stigma Perceptions? Results from an Experiment in Abuja, Nigeria",Communication to Overcome Stigma,"HIV-related stigma is believed to result in negative social consequences for people with the disease and to be a deterrent to HIV serostatus testing. The ability of communicators to change peoples stigma perceptions and subsequently impact decisions to test, however, is not well understood. Based on the entertainment-education approach, this paper presents the results of a field experiment conducted in Abuja, Nigeria testing a mediated intervention designed to reduce HIV-related stigma and risk perceptions. The results indicate that the intervention was effective relative to a control in impacting perceptions of the severity of HIV and some stigma related attitudes, particularly for male participants; and that risk and stigma perceptions significantly impact intentions to test for HIV."
2005-0222,Capture the Effect of Interactivity: Examining the Influence of Third Variables on the Processing of Interactivity,Theoretical Issues in the Study of Interactivity,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,Capture the Effect of Interactivity: Examining the Influence of Third Variables on the Processing of Interactivity,Theoretical Issues in the Study of Interactivity,"The purpose of this study is to examine the competing models of interactivity. Interactivity is conceptualized as intrinsic media attributes which afford message-sending and message-receiving through the same medium. Operationally, interactivity is manipulated along two dimensions: the number of keywords (responsiveness) and the number of hyperlinks. Regarding this, the study has three goals: first, it will investigate whether the influence of interactivity is converted to media effects through the mechanism of perceived interactivity. Second, it will explore whether the relationship between interactivity and perceived interactivity is moderated by personality traits, such as self-efficacy and need for cognition. Finally, it will develop an Internet self-efficacy scale. There is currently no widely accepted Internet self-efficacy scale. As such, this research will be helpful for researchers to clarify inconsistent empirical results concerning the relationship between interactivity and media effects. The study employs audience tracking software to record the duration of a web page viewed, the amount of hyperlinks clicked, and the address of a web page visited, which serve as behavioral indicators of interactivity."
2005-0223,Caring About Health Care: A Search for the Issue Public,Conceptual and Methodological Issues in Public Opinion,Political Communication,,,Paper,Caring About Health Care: A Search for the Issue Public,Conceptual and Methodological Issues in Public Opinion,"Questions surround the conceptualization and empirical identification of issue publics. Theoretical questions also surround the extent to which issue public membership stems from either (a) general stratification of the population along a general political attentiveness dimension, or (b) from more issue-specific origins, principally personal importance of the issue. This research examines in detail the structure of the issue public for health care reform, drawing from extensive, nationally representative survey data tapping both general attentiveness to news and public affairs, specific interests in health care issues, and motivations (e.g., personal health and financial conditions) to follow health care reform issues. We furthermore adopt a multi-dimensional approach to defining the contours of the issue public for health care policy, separately studying its cognitive, affective, and behavioral underpinnings. Results indicate only weak interconnections across these dimensions, and somewhat different structural patterns underlying each. While high scores on all three dimensions are related to general attentiveness and engagement in public affairs, the cognitive (health care knowledge) dimension has little to do with issue-specific interests and motivations and follows clear lines of general socio-economic stratification. In contrast, both the affective and behavioral dimensions (health issue opinionation and participation in health-related political activities, respectively) do appear substantially related to the perceived personal and national importance of health care, serious personal health conditions, and difficulties affording health care. Theoretical, conceptual and methodological implications of these findings are discussed."

Female undergraduates and particularly those majoring in public relations are shown to have the aptitudes and most of the requisite attitudes needed to become public relations managers. In addition, women were more interested in symmetrical communication than men, offering more versatility and sophistication for the field. However, they appear disinclined to take on the managerial role, envisioning a less-focused career than men envision and opting for technician over managerial positions."

Drawing on a survey among 490 adolescents, we found a nonlinear age effect, indicating that early adolescents (12- to 14-year-olds) were most prone to talk with strangers on the Internet. In contrast to earlier research, introversion was not related to adolescents tendency to talk with strangers. The motives of entertainment, meeting new people, and social compensation increased adolescents' online communication with strangers. Adolescents online communication with strangers did not enhance their probability to establish online romantic relationships."

To this end, a random sample of 161 parents of 5- to 17- year olds in Ingham County, Michigan was surveyed about their childs fear responses to the war and patterns of exposure. Using developmental theory and research, age-related hypotheses were advanced. The results show that 13- to 17- year olds reportedly watched more news coverage of the war and experienced greater fear/concern than did 5- to 8- year olds. Also consistent with predictions, younger children were reportedly more scared by concrete, visual dangers depicted in the news whereas older children were reportedly more scared by abstract, verbally communicated threats. Despite multiple controls, news viewing of the War on Iraq was a significant and positive predictor of childrens heightened safety concerns but not behavioral manifestations of upset."

Results demonstrated the association between binge drinking and chilling effects, although this link was only seen in friendships. Chilling effects were found to be related to low partner commitment levels, chilling effects due to regrettable incidents following binge drinking were stronger in platonic than romantic relationships, and males and females did not differ in their chilling responses."
2005-0254,Civic Participation in Contemporary Consumer Culture: Roles of Media and Personality,Extending Media Effects Theories,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Civic Participation in Contemporary Consumer Culture: Roles of Media and Personality,Extending Media Effects Theories,"Scholars in various fields have criticized the the commercialized content of the media by suggesting that media driven consumer culture diminishes civic-mindedness. Nonetheless, some scholars argue that consumer and civic culture are not separate entities, but instead are inextricably linked with positive interrelationships. Despite a history of discussion surrounding these relationships, they are only beginning to be empirically investigated. Thus, this study examines the influences of media on indicators of consumer and civic culture. Further, the interrelationships of civic participation with consumption activities are considered. In so doing, the role of opinion leadership is included, due to the possibility that individuals who have leadership traits are likely to be leaders in media use, consumption, and participation.
To explore these issues, this study performed a secondary analysis of the 2000 DDB Life Style Survey data with a sample of 3,122 adults. A series of hierarchical regressions and correlations were used to test study hypotheses. The results showed that the use of informational media motivates status-conscious consumption, socially conscious consumption, and civic participation. More importantly, the endogenous core of civic participation and consumption activities were all positively interrelated. Underlying these relationships is opinion leadership, which indirectly influences both citizen and consumer activities mediated through media use. In addition, the results indicate that opinion leadership is the common factor behind the positive dynamic between consumer and citizen activism."
2005-0255,"Class, Consumption, and Reading Formations of Harry Potter in Urban China",Communication and Media Studies in Asia,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,"Class, Consumption, and Reading Formations of Harry Potter in Urban China",Communication and Media Studies in Asia,"This paper explores the critical reception of the Harry Potter books and associated products by Chinese youth in selected urban centers in China (specifically Shanghai and Hong Kong). The critically acclaimed childrens fantasy fiction is taken as a significant prism reflecting, if not crystallizing, wider cultural and social debates about youths reading culture in the current state of global cultural interactions. Specifically, our paper aims to examine the dynamic but hitherto unexplored correlations among three issues: (a) local reading of a globally popular text, (b) the acquisition by Chinese youth of symbolic cultural resources drawn from the narratives, worldviews, and creative imaginations found in translated popular literature and film, and (c) the formation of an emerging Chinese urban middle-class culture. Research over the last decade has suggested the increasing importance of transnational cultural consumption for the development of a cosmopolitan outlook defined as an intellectual, aesthetic, and social stance of openness toward divergent cultural experiences. By employing multiple qualitative research methods, we empirically detail the specific contexts, forces, and processes through which the reception of Harry Potter shapes the changing values, aesthetic tastes, literary experiences, wider social networking practices, cosmopolitan outlook, and ultimately social class identities among youth in Hong Kong and Shanghai, two (rival) cities with separate but mirrored histories of modernization."
2005-0256,Click and Mortar Strategies Viewed from the Web: A Content Analysis of Online/Offline Integration,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Click and Mortar Strategies Viewed from the Web: A Content Analysis of Online/Offline Integration,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,"E-commerce researchers have argued that retailers are increasingly using a click and mortar strategy, whereby online and offline channels are becoming more integrated. Despite case study evidence for the benefit of this approach, an analysis of the Web sites of nearly 1000 retailers having both an online and offline presence reveals that real integration across channels is relatively uncommon. Most sites pursue mainly low intensity, informational integration such as simply listing retail store locations or hours. Few offer complex integration capabilities such as the ability to search local store inventories, or to pick up or return online purchases in a local outlet. Regression analyses reveal that retail sector and firm resources help to explain this discrepancy. Some product types require more physical presence than others, and true integration appears to require a degree of investment and IT sophistication not available to small retailers."

The study also examined differences and similarities in media content characteristics with special reference to media content, advertising practices and privacy policy, and the extent of theoretical applications in the four children's web sites studied.
Based on analyses of top four mainstream children's web sites based in the United States -- Children's Television Workshop , Disney Online , Nickelodeon Online , and PBS Online , this study concluded that the media content of children's web sites was characterized by: (a) surfeit of information for every growth stage for children and parents, (b) abounding array of attractive graphics, (c) a combination of multimedia features and interactive content, and (d) a thriving electronic community of ideas and information. The segmented presentation of media content tailored for pre-schoolers, older children and parents reflected direct applications of Erik Erikson's theory of development stages of children and teenagers, David Elkind's observed phenomenon of 'patchwork-identity' and the heterogeneous lifestyle of young people."

In a web-based field experiment, 366 German and American participants browsed through online news. The displayed articles were associated with different levels of newsworthiness (number of topic-related articles), credibility (sources' credibility established in a pretest), and recency (time span since report's upload). While newsworthiness perceptions did not increase with number of related articles in linear fashion, perceived high newsworthiness resulted in longer news exposure times. A complex interaction revealed that impacts of credibility on news consumption depended on cultural setting and frequency of online news reading. Recency only influenced American news readers."

Although it is understood that communication about Internet information occurs in medical encounters, research has been limited about the actual occurrence of talk between clinicians and patients about health information that the patient has found on the Internet. We conducted a study to examine patients experiences talking to their clinicians about Internet health information.

The study sample (n=920) was recruited from Internet health message boards to participate in an online survey. Participants in the study sample reported that they had researched their or their loved ones health on the Internet within the last year and had talked with a clinician about that information. Participants completed a 30-item survey, including questions focusing on participants recent, recalled encounters with a clinician.

There was no difference between male and female clinicians use of legitimation behaviors or between male and female patients perceptions of such behaviors. A small correlation was found behind patient/clinician familiarity and legitimation behaviors. Legitimation was significantly associated with patient satisfaction ratings. Interestingly, patient satisfaction ratings were relatively low. A second patient outcome, change in concern, was also associated with the degree to which the patient felt legitimated by the clinician.

An understanding of the occurrence of clinician-patient talk about Internet health information and its relationship to patient outcomes is important for practicing clinicians as well as medical educators who seek to better understand, and thus improve, the communicative nature of the medical encounter."

To make this technology more palatable to the general public, cloning institutions employ specific rhetorical strategies to offset the negative images associated with this controversial field of science. Recognizing these rhetorical constraints associated with the process of cloning, one institution, Genetic Savings and Clone Inc. (GSC), has carefully crafted its website so its intended audience will accept its message and use the services this company has to offer. GSC, a North American company clones family pets for customers willing to pay a fee of $50,000. GSC manages to subvert controversy with deliberate use of rhetorical strategies that conceals the negative aspects of cloning to the customer. To illuminate these strategies, Bormanns (1972) Fantasy-Theme Analysis method is employed to analyze the social structures in place allowing GSC to persuade customers to clone their pets. Our analysis concluded that GSC employs a pragmatic rhetorical strategy in which GSC transforms themselves into an expert doctor with technology as partner and the customers are rhetorically repositioned as a patient willing to transplant guilt to the doctor. Finally, our essay examines future implications for pet owners, and businesses selling controversial products are discussed. This paper is Questioning the Dialogue by pinpointing what rhetorical strategy GSC uses that permits audiences to purchase cloning services without concerns or guilt for cloning controversy."

Access to the Internet is associated with socioeconomic status. However, whether access to Internet-based health information reduces disparities in health care is unknown. Even less is known about these issues in clinical oncology interactions, where being informed is especially critical to decision making. This study (a) analyzes relationships between patients’ reports of post-diagnosis use of the Internet for cancer information and relational features of communication with oncologists (e.g., closeness, control, language as coded from videotapes), patients’ use of other sources of information about cancer (e.g., print, electronic, and interpersonal sources), patients’ self-assessments of their specialized knowledge (e.g., behavioral science, medicine, natural sciences); and (b) investigates the role of patients’ socioeconomic status in mediating those relationships."

The purpose of this paper is to analyze feedback given by students of a communication theory class, which uses an integrated approach to help students learn the concepts of communication theory. This analysis will seek to determine how this integrated approach helps students understand communication theory, if at all it does help them. This paper draws upon the scholarship of teaching and learning, and collaborative learning, to analyze the emergent situation in the class room. The students make active use of Blackboard  an eLearning tool to facilitate interaction amongst themselves as well as the instructors. The paper focuses on the impact of such technologies to supplement pedagogical techniques in making them more constructive and effective."

They observe crop yields in farms substantially lower than those in research stations. They dont know why farmers adopt/reject particular technologies. What is the right approach? is repeatedly raised.

This paper investigates how rice farmers in a Philippine village utilize communication to engage in dialogue, i.e., exchange, negotiate and form meanings on farming (including innovations). In doing so, it examines collective definitions on farming, mechanisms for and participants in the dialogue, communication elements/messages, and farming knowledge/ practices. Based on findings, the paper calls on those engaged in technology transfer to: view communication also as meaning negotiation, rethink how (not assume that) information becomes knowledge, recognize local knowledge (not accept unquestioningly scientific knowledge), manage local communication resources (not introduce modern channels), and contextualize audiences within their communities (not as isolated individuals)."

Respondents reported coping with their emotions (sadness, anger) primarily by seeking information, but also by seeking support. Information seeking was associated with a stronger connection to the event (interest in space, identification with the crew), as well as higher levels of both sadness and anger. Information seeking was also associated with higher levels of both TV news exposure and Internet use. In contrast, support seeking was associated with more identification with the crew and more anger, and was associated with greater use of the Internet, but not more TV news exposure. In addition, the two media sources were associated with different emotional reactions: TV news exposure was associated with more sadness, whereas Internet use was associated with more anger. Interpretations of the results and suggestions for future research are discussed."

The influence by the media instances to creativity and the relationship between media exposure and media instances in a creative task were investigated.
In the study, participants were asked to create a movie scenario format story , after which they listed the instances, examples, or events they thought about during story development. Two experts in film production judged the stories in terms of originality and quality. The instance sources were content-analyzed and divided into media source instance and non-media source instances. Participants' media exposure was also measured with emphasis on genre specific viewing.
The results showed that first, participants retrieved media exemplars during creating a story. Second, media exemplars contributed to originality and quality. Finally, the direct effect of media exposure to creativity and the indirect effect of media exposure to creativity, which includes the mediating variable of media instance generation were analyzed. No direct or indirect effect was found. The results were discussed in accessibility construct and creative tasks."

This paper continues the intellectual trajectory of such scholarship, but takes cultural debates over skin color into the international context of South Asia. Using a qualitative methodological approach that combines feminist and semiotic approaches to media texts, the authors study representations of gender and light skin and dark skin color in the popular illustrated Amar Chitra Katha comic books that are produced in India and marked to Indian children all over the world. The analysis of these children's print media reveals a disturbing hierarchy in the ways in which these comic books represent light- and dark-skinned male and female characters, figures and animals. The illustrations associate men's dark skin with anger, hostility, physical aggression, and failure while women are either symbolically annihilated or represented as demonic, promiscuous, and subordinate. The study points to the value of taking academic discussions of the politics of gender and skin color outside of the Western context to Asian communities that may be perceived as homogenous."

Conflicts receiving a majority of the attention, nationally and internationally, include those between Christians and Muslims in Maluku and those between indigenous Dayaks and migrant Madurese in Kalimantan. The paper begins with a description of these conflicts, and a review of selected explanations employed by observers to account for the violence. The second section includes an examination of the traditional explanations of factors thought to contribute to the eruption and exacerbation of these conflicts. Finally, a survey of relevant contemporary political theories offering frameworks for the analysis of Indonesia’s conflicts is considered."

This study specifically investigated the ways individuals grant forgiveness. Consistent with Kelley (1998), three types of forgiveness granting behaviors emerged: direct, indirect, and conditional. Results revealed forgiveness behavior use differed for friends (n = 133) and dating partners (n = 135), such that friends employed more indirect behaviors whereas dating partners employed more direct and conditional behaviors. Results also revealed that while behavior use was related to offender blameworthiness, it was unrelated to offense severity. A secondary focus of this study was post-forgiveness rumination, or the negative resentment that lingers after individuals grant forgiveness. Over 20% of the sample experienced moderate to high post-forgiveness rumination and individuals were most likely to ruminate following particularly severe and blameworthy transgressions. Post-forgiveness rumination was unrelated to forgiveness behaviors. Post hoc analyses suggest men and women tend to communicate forgiveness differently."

Some researchers have seriously questioned the validity of major instruments measuring self-construal across cultural groups. To address the validity issue, this study developed quantitative measures from ethnographic data. In five scenarios mapping self-close other boundaries, 171 Anglo-Canadians and 224 Mainland Chinese were asked to make a decision and offer a reason for the decision. Two intriguing findings emerged from the data. (1) In comparison with Anglo-Canadians, Mainland-Chinese were more likely to share material belongings with close-others and less likely to share their thoughts/opinions. The first part of this finding provides unequivocal support for the theories of Self-Construal and Individualism-Collectivism whereas the latter part challenges an important assumption of these theories, which contends that collectivists should be more likely than individualists to share everything they own (including opinions) with close others. This unconventional finding proposes the division of material and thoughts/opinions sharing of self-other boundary in future cross-cultural self-construal research. (2) There were significant differences in the reasons Canadians and Chinese offered for what they would or would not do in a specific situation. In conclusion, this article contributes to the field in that it reports pioneering research, via both qualitative and quantitative means, on sharing material belongings and opinions/thoughts in samples from individualistic and collectivistic cultures. The findings of this study illustrate, specify, and challenge the universal utility of the theories of self-construal and I-C."

Therefore, we use insights from the field of political communication and especially election campaign research to formulate our hypotheses. By conducting an automatic content-analysis on two Dutch newspapers for the period 1991-2003, using various wordlists and relating the outcomes to yearly changes membership figures for 137 organizations, we conclude that news makes a difference. The visibility of the organization as well as of its issue contribute to positive changes in membership. Though being very cautious, the results furthermore seem to point to positive effects of indicators of support and indicators of failures occurring in the same article as the organization does. Our results confirm the desirability to continue developing methods for automatic content analysis, but also point to the fact that a lot of progress is still to be made."

Organizations at times have less than 15 percent of its employees from the home culture (Ray, 1998). This research has drawn from a problem arising due to the changing nature of organizations. Thus necessitating a need for understanding the dynamics and the effect culture has in organizations, especially in managerial efficiency. The urgency to study the changing nature of organizations is caused by increasing difficulties in the workplace due to cultural differences. The globalization of markets is also having an impact on the work environment. The scope of the present study will fall under the area of study of Intercultural and Organizational Communication. The attempt is to better understand the process of adaptation of a foreigner partaking in the fast expanding global market of jobs. Particularly, the focus will be on the interaction between individuals personal culture and the organizational culture they encounter in the work place."

The method of historical analysis and extended literature review was used to generate in-depth information on the research topic. The policies regarding rural development in general and the specific communication modes employed to facilitate their implementation in particular were examined and analyzed at each historical stage. Government statistics, news reports and academic research findings served as main sources of data for the historical analysis. The findings show that Chinas rural communication is characterized by an integration of mass media and interpersonal communication with the highlighting of mass media communication in national integration and a combination of indigenous media and face to face contacts to meet the local needs. Chinas experiences suggest that the frame of reference must be taken into account when communication and development are addressed. It is impossible to gain an in-depth understanding of the role of communication in the process of rural development without referring to the political, social, economic and cultural structures of China. We have observed a persistent continuity of the Communist ideology in the past fifty years, though its operational definitions vary with the perceptions of the major tasks confronting the country under different leadership."

By studying this relationship and womens need for certain types of communication while exercising, scholars may be able to improve participation rates in social exercise settings. The psychological effects of communicated support on womens social physique anxiety were of particular interest.

Exercisers from Curves for Women, a womens-only gym, and Bally Total Fitness, a more traditional gym that caters to both sexes were examined. Survey data indicated a significant difference in perceived self-esteem support between womens-only gyms and traditional unisex gyms. The analysis also revealed that women with high social physique anxiety perceived themselves to have little social support. This was key in determining how to ease levels of social physique anxiety, which some scholars (Lantz, 1991; Crawford & Eklund, 1994) see as a barrier to exercise for women. The results also revealed that the amount of social support one perceived is related to the level of cohesion reported. As perceived support increases, cohesion increases, and social physique decreases. Curves for Women was found to offer more self-esteem support to its members than Bally Total Fitness. Communication in the form of social support may be a significant key to improving exercise participation and overall health. Understanding these factors related to exercise engagement may improve effort for promoting physical activity."

This study presents and analyzes a case of a communication program that possibly answers some key questions between theory and praxis for participatory communication for social change. This paper discusses the relevance of this case study by situating it within the current theoretical mix in the field and its limitations.

Considering that we are living in a time of strong economic and cultural globalisation, in a time of rupture in the modernization process of world society (Appadurai 1996) - with mass migration and huge developments in the electronic media at the core of the development -, how can we then reconceive the role of media and communication in development? With lifestyles in transition and identities in crisis, what becomes the role of media and communication in enhancing sustainable development?

This papers taps into the current debates about rethinking communication for development, proposing a stronger attention on the emerging concept of communication for social change. This concept represents a reaffirmation of some principles known from the field of participatory communication in the past, but first and foremost: it recognizes the fact that to pursue sustainable solutions to the development challenges of the 21st century, be it HIV/AIDS or diabetes, environmental degradation or even terrorism, we must address  and communicate about - the root causes of these problems. Poverty and social inequality are key issues, but linked to those are also the issues of securing voice and visibility to marginalized causes and people as well as recognizing popular culture and cultural diversity. For media and communication to be articulating social change, this paper argues, they must inherently touch and challenge issues of human rights, power relations, the public sphere and popular culture."

The cells are occupied by disputants with differing strategic interaction rules. After interacting with neighboring cells, each disputant decides to either retain the original strategy or adopt that of a neighbor, depending on the relative success of the strategies, thus allowing us to observe how cooperation evolves based on the initial distribution of strategies and the make up of the population. In this paper, we use a network approach to answer questions about strategy evolution in the game of Chicken. We identify the nodes of a network with cells of an automaton and consider two nodes to be adjacent if they are neighboring cells in the automaton. Once we think of the strategies as evolving in a network, instead of in the classic spatial automaton, we can determine structural influences of strategy evolution."
2005-0301,Communication Patterns and Civic Life on the Internet in Korea,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,Political Communication,,,Paper,Communication Patterns and Civic Life on the Internet in Korea,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,"This study investigated the two relationships between communication patterns and civic virtues, and between civic virtues and political participation on the Internet. Unlike real world communication, the Internet space can reduce the influence of hierarchical communication structure and social prejudices on sex, income, or education. The anonymity on the Internet encourages freedom of expression and thoughts.
Through questionnaire survey conducted to Korean university students, the paper looked at the level of human expression and reception on the Internet. This study considered online writing as the human expression of speaking, and online reading as the human reception of listening. Based on the level of expression and reception on the Internet, this paper divided survey respondents into four groups.
The result of the survey showed that two groups with higher level of writing displayed more individuality, i.e. willingness to express. On the other hand, two other groups with higher level of reading manifested more civility, i.e. readiness to hear other people's opinions. However, the participation level on the Internet was higher in balanced two groups of writing and reading than other unbalanced groups.
The survey concluded that writing and reading on Internet is equally important to civic virtues. While writing, the expressive function of communication, is related with individual aspect, reading, the receptive function of communication, is related with communal aspect. People who exercised both writing and reading were more likely to be highly participating citizens on Internet."

It is proposed that consumers engage in online privacy management (OPM) through their decisions to reveal or conceal information about themselves in interactions with online retailers. Rates of withholding information, deception, and information seeking are framed as OPM strategies and data from 213 participants visiting an ecommerce website are used to test a series of research questions based on CPM logic. Key factors proposed to provide insight into decisions to disclose or withhold information include gender, past online and ecommerce experience, generalized concern about online privacy issues, type of information requested by a web site, and the impact of the specific language used in online retailers privacy policies. Findings suggest that online consumers erect boundaries around personal information and form rules to decide when to reveal information based on risk-benefit calculations and situational demands, consistent with CPM theory. Overall, results of this study provide important knowledge about privacy in online commercial transactions, serve as a sound basis for more directed theory construction in this arena, and have important practical and policy implications."
2005-0303,"Communication Styles, Social Networks, and Learning Performance in a CSCL Community",Online Learning,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,"Communication Styles, Social Networks, and Learning Performance in a CSCL Community",Online Learning,"The aim of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between communication styles, social networks, and learning performance in a CSCL Community. Using social network analysis and longitudinal survey data, we analyzed how 31 distributed learners had created collaborative learning social networks in a CSCL community where civil engineering students from two universities had collaborated on the design of aerospace systems using online collaboration tools. The results indicated that communication styles significantly influenced the way those students created and sustained collaborative learning social networks. We also found that the resultant social network properties were significantly affected learners performance. The study suggests that both individual differences (communication styles) and social networks are critical elements in a distributed learning environment. We also propose that adding personality theory to structural analysis contributes to an enhanced picture of how distributed learners build their social and intellectual capitals in the context of a CSCL community."

In the pilot study, a measure of intersubjectivity is developed and tested by gathering data from students (N=42) recruited to play a communication-intensive board game in seven teams of two to four people over the course of three sessions of play. Factor analysis of data from 392 dyadic exchanges produced an intersubjectivity scale comprising seven of nine original items with a reliability of .92 explaining 55% of the variation across cases. The intersubjectivity scales encompassed items relating to goal compatibility, attitude similarity, and trust, as well as attributions of competence, responsibility, openness, and knowledge. Degree and duration of communication were observed to increase intersubjectivity, which was also higher within teams than between them. The results also indicate the possibility that some kind of movement away from a communicative toward a strategic perspective occurred as the game proceeded. The demonstration that such a phenomenon is potentially accessible to empirical observation is the most interesting result to emerge from the initial analysis of these data."

For this purpose, this study collected front pages of print newspapers and home pages of online counterparts from 112 US newspapers published in 104 cities. Then, how prominently these newspapers covered 2004 Democratic Primary elections was examined by measuring the proportion of the space of Primary-related stories over the space of a front page or a home page and the number of Primary-related photos presented on the front page or home page. For the political characteristics of communities, 13 secondary data were gathered and grouped into three construct variables such as political interest, political affiliation, and political organization.
Correlation, hierarchical multiple regression, and contextual analyses found that the political characteristics of communities influenced the community newspapers coverage of the Democrat Primaries. Interestingly, this community influence on newspaper content was greater for print versions than online counterparts. The boundary-transcending capacity of online newspapers might have led them to be less vulnerable to the community influence on media than the print newspapers."

The article analyzes data from participant observation, and in-depth interviews with employees of TV ROC and residents of Rocinha. The objective is to investigate to what extent the station achieves empowerment and participation in the community. The study finds that TV ROC is useful; it is the communitys space; it serves as a mirror, and as an eye and mind opener; it contributes to ease social tensions; can be utilized for educational purposes. According to employees, the station induces social change by allowing residents to learn media skills and make a living out of their own programs. However, community members indicate that TV ROC might be increasing the social disparities within Rocinha by not paying enough attention to the residents who live in its most needy areas. Finally, the issues that TV ROC seems to be best at are those of identity, putting local faces on the television screens of those who live in Rocinha."

Additionally, the effects of media literacy training on prejudice reduction were also examined. In this experiment, participants saw a literacy or control video before reading the relevant news booklet after which they completed a questionnaire that included Likert-type scales and feeling thermometer measures of affective responses. The findings reveal that feelings of contempt and pity were expressed towards Blacks and Indians respectively. Also, reading stereotypical news stories were likely to increase pity feelings towards Indians. Moreover, participants who read stories depicting Indians reported greater contempt and lesser warmth towards Blacks in the literacy as compared to the control condition. These results are interpreted in terms of media priming, exemplification, and comparative stereotyping."

Who is exactly a journalist is defined in many ways or, worse, not defined at all. This has large methodological consequences as it makes the comparison of journalists around a globe a puzzling enterprise  and a cliffhanger for those who like challenges. This paper aims to pro-vide a common conceptual reference point for the comparative study of journalism by suggesting abstract-level definitions of journalism as well as its organizations, programs and roles on the ground of post-Parsonian systems theory. Furthermore, it develops a taxonomy for the identification of territorial, essentialist, life-style-specific, value-centered and organizational journalism cultures."

In addition to direct effects on attitudes, which were directly examined, two models were examined. The first model, based on past work in this area, treated perceptions of topic importance and source credibility competence as separate forced. When this model failed to fit al the predicted paths, a second model was constructed in which the chief difference was treating topic importance and competence as an interaction term. This model fit the data quite well. In such a model, attitudes could be predicted from a combination of evidence use, message believability, and source credibility ratings on the character dimension. Believability, in turn, was predicted from perceived message clarity and source character. Character was predicted from the use of evidence, perceived message clarity, and the interaction of topic importance with source competence. Message clarity was predicted from the interaction of topic importance with source competence. Thus, results suggested that evidence and credibility effects were somewhat complicated and influenced the ways the message was perceived as comprehensible and credible."

In this paper, we consider the influence of the degree of competitiveness of such organizational cultures on knowledge sharing, a crucial process in knowledge management. First, we distinguish two central processes of knowledge sharing: knowledge donating and knowledge collecting. Then, we discuss motivational factors related to knowledge sharing, or variables related to individuals willingness to share their knowledge with others: relational uncertainty, social identification and affective commitment. Next, we discuss the dimensions of a competitive organizational culture (individualism, masculinity and low uncertainty avoidance), and how these dimensions influence such motivational factors. We present a theoretical model that was tested in a survey study among six different organizations. The results generally support our theoretical arguments: individualism, masculinity and low uncertainty avoidance are relevant dimensions of a competitive culture, and these dimensions exert a generally negative influence on both knowledge donating and knowledge collecting. This influence is both indirect (mediated by the motivational factors) and direct. The distinction between intra- and interdepartmental knowledge sharing appears to be relevant: where knowledge sharing within ones department is primarily influenced by the motivational factors, knowledge sharing with other departments is directly influenced by the dimensions of a competitive culture. Also, knowledge sharing appears to start at the intra-departmental level, and gradually extends to the interdepartmental level."

However, the changing face of medicine and the advent of the managed care revolution has negatively impacted this collective image. The place of physicians within the continually raging debate over the costs and consequences of health care is an uncertain one. This paper offers a rhetorical analysis of news reporting surrounding physicians and managed care to unpack the possible lessons or equipment for living provided about health care practitioners in public discourse. Particular attention is paid to the construction of physician ethos in these accounts. Two broad narrative strains emerged in this group of articles a) a patient-focused narrative emphasizing the absence of doctors as patients struggle against managed care companies, and b) a physician-focused narrative, which portrays physicians as frustrated agents in the health care debate. Implications of these representations and the ways in which they compromise physician credibility are discussed."

Rhythm, tempo, timing, formal features of television, formats of visual and auditory features are some of terms used to describe pacing. Pacing is often discussed in terms of its speed levels  slow, moderate and fast. How fast is considered fast in pacing is also explicated in the study.
This study also identified some of factors that influence pacing. Genres of television programs and films, story plots, audience, and complexity of content are found to influence levels of pacing. When pacing is studied as an independent variable, different levels of pacing influence viewers attention, comprehension, memory, and affective measures such as credibility, persuasiveness, a sense of reality, conflict and excitements."

There is a general perception that political chat is fragmented and incoherent. This study aims to better understand how focused political chat is in comparison with three other chat topics, cancer support, entertainment, and auto racing. Dynamic Topic Analysis and Content Analysis were applied to two hours of chat devoted to each of four topics: politics, cancer, entertainment and sports/auto racing. Findings demonstrate that topic matters to how coherent the talk is, with talk in the politically-oriented chat room being more coherent than in the other rooms. This research suggests that chat technology may not be inherently bad for reasoned political discourse."

Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on any conflict and competition that might occur and the underlying assumption is that conflict, competition, and self-serving behaviors are minimal. This research is an attempt to look at everyday practices in the Hong Kong organizational world to examine these assumptions within the context of real organizations. Forty-two Hong Kong residents were interviewed about their interpersonal relationships in the workplace. The accounts my informants provided diverged greatly from the classical Confucian collectivist assumptions. While some harmony and cooperative behaviors were reported, the overwhelming number of informants spoke of conflict and competition as common workplace behaviors. In addition, when behavioral explanations for harmony and conflict avoidance were proffered, rather than indicating they engaged in these behaviors because of any particular value placed on harmony or for the good of the group, informants indicated that conflict avoidance and harmony were practiced for instrumental reasons."

This paper examines one particular discourse of workplace spirituality  the discourse of evangelical Christianity  and suggests that it may create, rather than resolve several tensions for women in the workplace. Using narrative analysis of stories presented in Flowers (2001) book, Women, Faith and Work: How Ten Successful Professionals Blend Belief and Business, I examine how three professional woman negotiate their identity in the face of competing discourses about the meaning of woman, faith, and work. This analysis suggests that each of the women elevates the discourse of faith over other competing discourses in order to maintain a coherent identity, or at least an illusion of a coherent identity, a choice which both enables and constrains their self-understanding and actions."

One is a voiceover reading of excerpts from an Italian nuns seventeenth-century ecclesiastic trial. The trial of Sister Benedetta is introduced into the film via the book Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy, author Judith C. Browns analysis of surviving archival documents. The chosen quotes of the nuns physical contact with another nun add humorous and erotic flavor to the Damned If You Dont lesbian context. Contemporary American audiences who interpret the nuns physical exchange as sexually lesbian would be aligned with Browns framework in Immodest Acts. The bodily bonds between the two seventeenth-century women, however, cannot be transparently understood from a modern perspective. Some scholars contest Browns analysis, arguing that in the Renaissance convent the nuns actions had a very different meaning. This paper explores debates about the cultural and historical shift of meaning of the corporeal connection between the two religious women and addresses the significance of such a shift for the contemporary spectator of Damned If You Dont and for modern conceptions of sexual identity. I analyze the difference of the gaze between the film, the book, and trial documents in how they present Sister Benedettas life events. Not producing historical truths, but rather focusing and framing history, the filmic and scholastic lenses disclose motivations and assumptions. This paper attempts to unearth some of the politics shaping the gazes that have attended to Sister Benedetta."

In the first section, this essay examines the rhetoric of the United Nations as it appears in a document issued by the International Telecommunication Union on December 12th, 2003 regarding the principles of an all-inclusive Information Society. Through the application of Fishers (1984) narrative paradigm and of Charlands (1987) notion of constitutive rhetoric, this examination gestures towards the emergence of an arbitrary global subject, which understands its position in a universal condition mediated by the benefits of technology. In the second section, this essay engages in the effort to track the constitution of this subject between the agency of its subjectivity and the policies of the institutions that interpellate it. Put more simply, this section poses the question of where is the appropriate place that we can search for the effects of constitutive rhetoric in the global condition."

Bush championed two of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. The president argued the cuts would stimulate the economy and make life better for average men, women, and children. Critics of the policies countered they would drive up the deficit and disproportionately benefit the wealthy. The latter is more true than the former, yet large majorities of Americans supported Bush's tax cuts--even though they would ultimately mean tax increases and program cuts disproportionately hurting themselves. Explaining this phenomenon is the prime purpose of this paper. It analyzes media coverage of the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts in hopes of providing a partial answer. Its specific goals were to determine which social class interests were represented in the coverage and if it may have contributed to the seemingly illogical public support for the plan. It finds that coverage provided little substantive insight into the distributive or redistributive effects of the tax cut and in subtle ways favored not only Bush's framing of the policy, but suppressed Americans' ability to conceptualize their political self-interests in class terms."

Four themes were identified as helping build an in-group identity. Out-group identity and how these individuals perceived their disabilities were also explored. Evidence indicated that these individuals did not have a strong perception of ""different-ness"" from the non-disabled community. Studying interactions of this population can help care providers better understand impediments to successful community placement."

But the money received from advertisers for airing commercials (about $50B in 2002) is only a small portion of the theoretical value of time for the average consumer to watch these commercials (about $800B). This gap shows a break in the dialog that should be explained. Overview of academic literature indicates that viewers attend only 20-30% of commercials, but other reasons are needed to explain the remainder of the gap. This time economics approach helps to bridge between the languages of dollars and minutes, and clarifies consumer behavior that is difficult to measure today. It could also help assessing the prospects of newer structures of interaction, where consumers are paying directly for programming through technologies such as Video on Demand and Digital Video Recorders."

The recommendations acted as a trigger for an enthusiastic debate on the different methods of allocating spectrum. Most analyses, however, only compare the different options or base their arguments in political or economic theory. This paper strengthens policy analysis by using a framework developed in the social studies of technology, focusing on, and analyzing the reasons for its recommendations from the Task Forces perspective. By using this inside-out approach and focusing on the policymaker, we arrive at an explanation for the privileging of the exclusive-use model of spectrum allocation over the spectrum-as-commons approach."

Evidence suggests that as a medium, the Internet does not compete with other news media but supplements them. Moreover, theories about omnivorousness from cultural sociology may help us understand how political information is consumed. To test these theories, I analyze the consumption of political information by comparing several news media with survey data from election periods in 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002. For many political communication scholars, this data from the Pew Internet and American Life and Pew Center for the People and The Press will be the best available comparative data about political communication and new media use over multiple election cycles. The data reveals an important group of American citizens who consume political information from multiple media and are politically engaged in multiple ways, primarily through new media. To explain the role of new media in contemporary political information, I analyze the habits of political omnivores, a small but growing portion of the population who use multiple media for gathering information about political news, issue and candidate campaigns, and election procedures."

Japan is perhaps one of the most Westernized non-Western nations. Or at least, it is the most modernized and the first First-World nation among the non-Western nations in the history. To obtain this status, after the long national seclusion (the late-1500-1854), Japanese started vigorously introducing Western culture and ideology to modernize and Westernize the nation. By this rapid Westernization, Japanese attempted to obtain an equal status to the Western powers and to distinguish themselves from other non-white people. This process included a reconceptualization of their racial identity, and white Westerners became a new racial reference for Japanese to become. This is what Dower (1986) succinctly names Caucasianization of Japan and Japanese. The paper is a historical analysis on this process of Caucasianization, its function, and how it fulfilled Japans circumstantial needs. The analysis employs both primary and secondary materials from the sixteenth to twentieth centuries."

Content analysis of general publications, such as newspapers or television news or entertainment programs, can give practitioners insight into persuasion or public attitudes toward a health behavior, and can help in designing an intervention. This method can enable public health researchers to broadly investigate changes in the public's thinking or approach to a problem. It is a way to mine publications for information on the attitudes of target populations. It also allows comparisons over time. This paper describes a content analysis of management and labor publications, which was part of a policy evaluation of Washington states proposed ergonomics rule. It also discusses the special role of trade publications in framing issues, keeping them before the public, and influencing the policy agenda."

The study provides more analytic approaches to assess how consumers converge on a health website and assesses consumer preference variables from a users perspective. Results show that content quality strongly predicts both consumer affective evaluation and overall satisfaction. Usability predicts consumer affective evaluation, but not overall satisfaction. Among the demographics, education is a significant predictor of affective evaluation, but in a negative direction."
2005-0329,Contested Notions of Identity in International Public Relations,Public Relations Top Paper Session,Public Relations,,,Paper,Contested Notions of Identity in International Public Relations,Public Relations Top Paper Session,"The Open Universitys circuit of culture model, which comprises a melding of critical/cultural and postmodern perspectives, encompasses five central discursive moments: regulation, production, consumption, representation, and identity. This study examines the World Health Organizations smallpox eradication campaign through the moment of identity to inform our understanding of international public relations practice and theory. The authors gathered data from a wide variety and in-depth collection of materials, allowing a number of emic perspectives to emerge. The model informs theory by recasting identity as a central, discursive concept within public relations that problematizes not only the organizational identity of WHO and the target publics of the campaign but even the identity of the issue itself. Just what was smallpox? How did its multiple, often conflicting identities inform the public relations aspects of the campaign? And how can the insights from the campaign extend and develop international public relations theory?"

Will this convergent tablet PC enhance the users memory? Or it will disorient readers as it often does on the Web? (McDonald & Stevenson, 1996)

The purpose of the proposed study is to explore how users process a Newsbook presented on a tablet PC, by comparing their cognitive responses to the same news content presented in print. Theoretically, the tablet PC based E-newsbooks can provide an opportunity to empirically test whether attribute-based media convergence (e.g., linearity, interactivity) may enhance mediated information processing. Methodologically and practically, by adopting actual stimuli while controlling other confounding variables, this study will generate ecologically valid study findings, which can be applied to news product development."

Along with CA, students with high or low pre-academic achievement (PAA) was also considered. The sample consisted of 155 undergraduate students at a large private university in a metropolitan city and 9 CL sessions (3 hours for each session) underwent. The data indicated that 1) the students PAA and communication CA had an interaction effect on class satisfaction. As for their academic performance, lower PAA students improved more than higher PAA students. The degree of academic improvement was also found to be influenced by the students CA level. In contrast to class satisfaction, there was no interaction effect of PAA and CA on academic improvement. The result implies that in implementing cooperative learning, more attention should be given to students' communication level as well as pre-achievement level."

This study serves to identify the use of information management within the experience of the justice system using focus groups composed of the family members of homicide victims. In an effort to manage uncertainty levels surrounding the events of the murder and dealing with the justice system, individuals are able to decide how to manage information. Through controlling the communication of information, which includes direct and indirect requests and active avoidance, individuals are able to manage their uncertainty-related anxieties. The analysis of these transcripts revealed a seemingly strong connection between information management and coping. These findings have implications for family members of homicide victims as well as for members of the justice system."

A total of 190 participants read 1 of 4 scenarios depicting either a positive/negative expectancy violation situation. They were asked to evaluate the violation described in terms of its valence, severity, and unexpectedness. Additionally, participants were asked to what extent they would aggressively and explicitly respond to the situation. Results indicated that severity of violations varied depending on both valence and commitment/intimacy level. Also, across both positive and negative expectancy violation conditions, highly committed/intimate respondents reported greater explicitness, but less aggressiveness in their response to the situation compared to less committed/intimate respondents."

This perspective takes into account the varying degree of managerial revolution take place within media organizations and the degree of structural pluralism of communities the media serve. The corporate media structure theory suggests that, contrary to popular belief, the corporate media are more capable of challenging powerful elites and induce social change than small-scale entrepreneurial counterparts. This paper discusses several hypotheses that may be derived for testing the utility of the corporate media structure theory as it explains the role of mass media as a social subsystem that helps pro-environmental policy reforms."

It uncovered that telecom liberalization of China can be characterized as corporatization, while that of Korea is a strategic movement for positioning itself as a leading country in telecom and IT sectors after the initial reluctant stance faced with the threats of WTO, especially the US. For China, the particular operational and organizational arrangement initiatives and the outcomes that follow through corporatization are in line with the Chinese governments political agenda of avoiding a fundamental change to state ownership and its economic reform program to inject vitality into state-owned enterprises. By contrast, the Korean government combined its strategic leadership and investment in infrastructure with the private sectors accumulated capabilities and resources, actively embracing the privatization of the telecommunications sector."

Right after coming out from this encounter, the plastic surgeon reported hat he had a very difficult time with the patient. What made this moment communicatively difficult and how these challenges were manifested in interaction is the analytical focus of this essay. Drawing upon a 60-minute videotaped encounter between the doctor and the patient as well as a 60-minute videotaped session with the cosmetic surgeon about this moment, the paper describes five communication challenges that the plastic surgeon faced in the interactional moment. They include: (a) grasping the patients reasons for the visit, (b) seeing what the patient sees, (c) being face-attentive when the body does not lie, (d) handling self-deprecating remarks, and (e) managing patient-initiated requests."

Their existence as naturalized reflections of an external reality, their status as reliable evidence, their transparency and universal readability, their fascination for viewers and their impact on public perceptions are all frequently presumed rather than investigated. Despite a tradition of scholarship that demonstrates the problematic complexities of pictorial communication, especially as utilized within the formats of news reports, an intuitive belief in the power of the camera to reflect, reveal and expose fundamentally persists. Recently published photographs of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq seem to confirm the direct effect of pictures in driving news agendas and shaping public perceptions. For many, the leaked photographs themselves seem to constitute the story. Yet, research on the genealogy of the Abu Ghraib pictures, and the waning attention paid to them in the months after May 2004, suggest that these photos appeared when they did largely because conditions favorable to an alternative frame for interpreting the invasion of Iraq had already developed, and that the lasting implications of the photographs themselves will depend upon the prevalent interpretive news frames in which they are viewed."

The foundational steps of formative research involved identifying general informational needs associated with key breast cancer events or experiences followed by differentiating individual characteristics that distinguish between informational needs. The next steps included creating a tailoring framework and then mapping CHESS existing content to these differentiating characteristics and treatment stages, and developing decision rules to trigger tailored content to users based on data they input into the system. Finally, low fidelity prototyping sessions were conducted to determine the most appropriate format for users to update variables informing CHESS tailoring, to identify the optimal degree of subtlety appropriate to deliver tailored content, and to learn how tailoring methods affect general navigation and usability. The objective of this case study is to help other eHealth developers learn from the insights weve gained from our extensive regimen of formative research focused on how to develop an online tailored information system for women with breast cancer."

Its coverage by national media is intensive. This study aimed to determine if media in this country is generating a pseudo-environment of excessive violence with its crime coverage. Could this coverage possibly be translated into fear by the population? A content analysis of crime stories of in one of the countrys most influential newspapers (O Estado de S.Paulo) was conducted for March 2002 and December 2001 and compared to a public opinion poll on safety concerns and statistics of crime in the city of São Paulo to see if this crime coverage produces an agenda-setting effect. The analysis found evidence that violent crime stories were more likely to be reported than property crime stories. The percentages of violent crimes reported in the newspaper did not match the official crime statistics, with a correlation indicator rho of 0.25, a weak correlation. This study revealed that, although there is intense coverage of crime and its issues, this coverage is concentrated in areas of the city of São Paulo, and nation in general, with more money and that the press may be focusing on crimes that affect the population with higher income."

This study critically examines the representation of sexual minorities (gays and lesbians) in Chinese media. Drawing on broadsheet and tabloid media coverage of sexual minorities in 2004, this study found that, though increasing visibility on mainstream media, sexual minorities are still exaggerated, marginalized, excluded, and silenced. The images of sexual minorities portrayed by Chinese media are often linked to disease, crimes, and sex, while real love can never be found. Under such dominant gaze of mainstream media, sexual minorities have been constructed as troubled, dirty, dangerous, and deviant sexual others. Increasingly visible presence of sexual minorities in Chinese media, does not translate into necessarily social acceptance and respect, rather, to a large extent, it reinforces the otherness of sexual minorities, and further alienates this silent group on the margin."

A survey of public relations and/or public affairs managers from Taiwans top-500 companies was undertaken to examine actual experiences of handling crises. The results showed that five crisis communicative strategies emerged from the factor analysis, i.e., denial, diversion, excuse, justification, and concession. Moreover, these five CCS can be placed in a two-dimension (continuum) matrix, i.e., defense-accommodation and specification-ambiguity. The paper concludes with a discussion of practical applications, theoretical contribution, and cultural implication of the results."

Drawing upon two surveys performed in 2000 and 2004 and employing factor analysis and regression, this paper argues that many disadvantaged populations have in fact been served through the federal and state public access programs designed to address the digital divide. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that these sites of public and community access, recent targets of budget cuts and calls for termination, remain important to the connectivity of many historically underserved groups. Their success demonstrates that policy makers in the 1990s, building on a critical view of the stratifying impacts of new technology diffusion, accurately used their social analysis and research like the NTIA Falling Through the Net surveys to design interventions that were quite effective, as reflected in survey data about use of public access."

Following reviews of (1) the considerable and well-known literature on the cultural imperialism thesis and its shortcomings and (2) the development and assumptions of cultural globalization/pluralism, I will argue that the cultural globalization perspectivelike the cultural imperialism thesis--is an inadequate framework because it does not incorporate issues of power. The paper formulates critical transculturalism in comparative perspective, according to the following criteria: theoretical conception of culture and global culture, site and scope of agency, process and outcome of the relation between structure and agency, media and empirical focus, and the role of the state in international communication."

In particular, focusing on the Chineses consumption of Korean dramas, films, cds and books, this study examined whether the Chineses beliefs about Korea and emotions and attitudes towards the Korean are affected. A research model was developed to account for the cognitive and affective processes leading to the formation of attitude, where the impacts of interpersonal interactions with Koreans and other intervening variables were also controlled for. A total of 2017 respondents were interviewed in Beijing and Shanghai. The results showed that the consumption of Korean media products as well as interpersonal interactions with Koreans led to a characteristic formation of stereotypical beliefs and emotions about Koreans. Attitudes towards the Korean were found to be affected by the consumption of media products. The implications of the findings were discussed in terms of increasing mass mediated cross-cultural experiences in the Northeast Asian region."

Cultivation theory offered no insight as to which processes account for cultivation effects or whether the effects extend to the viewers behavior. Our study focused on exposure to lifestyle programs, the construction of consumer reality (OGuinn & Shrum, 1997) and consumer behavior. Extending entertainment studies and emotion psychology, emotional involvement and perceived realism were expected to play significant roles in the cultivation process. Furthermore, social identity was included. A random sample of commuters (N = 200) completed a questionnaire related to twelve different lifestyle programs. The variables under study were operationalized in an indirect manner with Likert-type scales. Results confirmed hypotheses. Heavy viewers had a more materialistic worldview and also bought products and performed activities recommended in lifestyle television more often than light viewers. Furthermore, perceived realism and emotional involvement significantly contributed to these effects. Finally, social identity significantly contributed to emotional involvement. Implications for the study of cultivation effects are discussed."

Characters, Personality, and Relationships",Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,Cultivation of Relationship Expectations through Accessibility,"What's Entertaining? Characters, Personality, and Relationships","Cultivation theory hypothesizes that media effects occur through increased accessibility of constructs activated in the media. We examined the effect of exposure to relationship-themed media on the accessibility of constructs related to relationships. Self-reported use of relationship-themed media predicted idealized expectations of marriage, relationship idealism, and chronic accessibility of relationship constructs. Short-term exposure to relationship-themed movies was associated with increased accessibility of relationship-themed constructs. Spreading activation was not evidenced: Relationship-related themes that were not specifically portrayed in the movies were not more accessible than in the control condition."

There has also been a lack of cohesive theoretical basis for much of the research. One explanation of this phenomenon is that sojourner studies have been largely driven by more practical (as opposed to theoretical) considerations of helping people adjust effectively to short-term cultural transitions (Kim, 2002). In spite of the variations in theory and methodology used in adaptation studies, one unifying theme has clearly emerged: all individuals who undergo cultural transitions  whether entering the country for the first time, returning to their home land, or regularly alternating places of residence  experience difficulties adjusting to the newly- entered environment.
While other predictors of adaptation differ and may not be applicable for all travelers, some form of identity change has been found necessary and inevitable for any individual adapting to a new environment, regardless of the persons country of origin (Anderson, 1994; Kim, 1988a; Sussman, 2001). This literature review explores sojourner adaptation research and shows that examining cross-cultural transition experiences of long- and short-term travelers, as well as international transients, is best done through the lens of cultural identity change. This paper will also show viable directions for future research in the field."

In addition to the efficacy of doctoral training, the forms and quality of it have been questioned. This study on cultural relational dialectics in doctoral dissertation advising relationships offers a new point of view to the discussion on the quality of doctoral education. The study focuses on the natives point of view. In addition to the relational dialectics approach, also the framework provided by the ethnography of communication is applied. The main data consists of six audio-taped and transcribed interviews of the Finnish advisors and advisees. In the data-analysis four relational dialectics were identified: autonomy  dependency, fact orientation  personal relating, asymmetry  symmetry, and judgment  decency. The dialectics were described in the particular manifestations in which the tension get recreated and/or enacted. The cultural models in doctoral training are discussed."

I see Cubas example as one that forces us to look at cultural freedom as a contingent set of practices and discourses. This approach challenges liberal ideas to freedom by forcing us to explore freedoms relation to cultural policy and state power. Using Foucaults ideas on power, I perform a brief genealogy of cultural freedom where I examine freedoms discursive constitution and its relationship to cultural policy and institutional practices in Cuba from 1959 to 1975. During this period the Cuban leadership instituted policy for film, literature, news, and the general production of culture within the Revolution. Also during this period, Cuba experienced the conflicting forces of censorship, cultural repression, and a cultural renewal that open the field of culture to greater production. This dialectic of powers productivity puts into question essentialist ideas of freedom and suggest the existence of an ongoing link between freedom, discourse, and practice."

Thus, there is no existing program for systematically gathering data that goes beyond simple indices of social welfare to reflect cultural states in which meaning is embedded. This paper is a first step in a theoretical reexamination of Gerbners original formulation of cultural indicators, as well as a roadmap for future work. We present a basic review of the main historical, theoretical, and applied aspects of established economic, social, and environmental indicators in order to develop a conceptual framework for integrating empirical measures of meaning with indices of social and economic conditions. Furthermore, we use the topic of violence and crime to demonstrate how an integrated framework combining social and cultural indicators may be applied to measure social welfare."

As filmmakers, photographers, authors, activists, the women work in, through and toward a differential form of consciousness as elaborated by Chela Sandoval (2000). They are located at the interstices, the border, of different social orders, and this location enables the creators to offer third ways, ways of seeing that pierce through debilitating binaries. Both the form and content of their work exhibits a metis or mestizaje mode of perceiving and acting (Anzaldua, 1987; Lionnet, 1995), a mode of survival but also a means to liberation. As Maria Lugones (1996) reminds us, If something or someone is neither/nor, but kind of both, not quite eitherit threatens by its very ambiguity the orderliness of the system, the schematized reality. It is the refusal to fall into the binaries of master narratives, and the insistence on metissage, that can enable dissident cultural workers to contribute to the creation of a new social realms, new social relations."

In this project, 2,558 participants in China, the Philippines, Malaysia (Chinese and Malay Malaysians) and the U.S. completed the Cultural Schema Questionnaire. Four objectives were investigated: (a) Determine whether the cultural schema scales of the Cultural Schema Questionnaire was valid, (b) investigate whether the cognitive reactions of local-employee groups toward Japanese behaviors are likely to vary across 5 local groups, (c) investigate whether Japanese samples' reactions to local employee groups vary across 5 Japanese groups, and (d) investigate whether subjects' cognitions are influenced by their cultural schemas and therefore cognitive reactions toward the other cultural members' behaviors are affected by the cultural schemas of their own and those of the other cultural group."

A theoretical framework provides a cultural basis for the development of advertising messages. Two cultural dimensions  individualism-collectivism and femininity-masculinity  are used to explain appearances and portrayals of people in commercial print messages from 43 countries. The method for investigation is a content analysis of advertisements from general interest magazines that are widely read in each nation. The study found that in masculine countries, men in advertisements are more likely to be portrayed in occupations and work like-situations than in feminine countries. Other findings failed to reach statistical significance, but show relationships in the direction proposed and provide indications for how culture affects advertising content."

However, there appears to be a schism between the cultural and social goals laid out for Canadian content in the 1991 Broadcasting Act and the largely industrial designs spelled out in Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulation. Where the Act calls for Canadian content to aid in supporting national identity and cultural sovereignty, CRTC regulation regards it as a fiscal resource for an economically viable production sector. This paper will examine these apparent contradictions and analyze the manner in which the Commission has endeavored to bridge the gap between these seemingly disparate goals for Canadian content. The CRTC has introduced a series of policies pertaining to specific categories of programming that are designed to increase the availability of Canadian content in popular genres of programming during peak viewing hours. This analysis shows that, while CRTC Canadian content regulations fall short of addressing the cultural mandates for the definition of Canadian content directly, they do aspire to fulfill them through the creation of a quota-oriented content framework. Furthermore, this paper argues that these regulations have balanced the varying and sometimes incompatible demands that the Act places on Canadian content and the Canadian broadcasting system as a whole."
2005-0370,Culture and Its Discontents: A Theory of Autonomy for Communication Studies,Retheorising Communication,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Culture and Its Discontents: A Theory of Autonomy for Communication Studies,Retheorising Communication,"Over the last century, changes in the production, distribution and consumption of the mass media have coincided with a heightened anxiety about their form as commodities. This paper looks specifically at a subset of the media referred to as cultural goods, which has been used as an umbrella term that can include television, film, music and other audio and visual recordings. It is applied to the creative works of a society, which have a role in maintaining or transmitting the identity, values and the structure of the community in which they were created. Despite the fact that they have a cultural function, it is argued that there is nothing exceptional about cultural goods that should compel one to treat them differently from any other commodity. So, for example, they should be subject to the same trade regulations and policies that govern any mass-produced item, be it cars, computers or toys. Against this position has stood a tradition of critical commentary that has resisted the tendency to treat culture as a commodity like any other. This paper explores an important aspect of this critical commentary: It is an examination of the manner in which culture has been imagined as possessing a value or function outside the logic of the commodity, which can be summed up in the complex of ideas surrounding the articulation of cultures autonomy."

By investigating a Chinese student organization on a U.S. campus and analyzing the qualitative data collected via multiple methods, this paper concluded that (a) culture shock is contextually based and its dimensions differ across time and space; (b) student organizations can play instrumental roles in helping students to cope with culture shock and gain intercultural competence by providing social support; and (c) communicating with same culture members can help intercultural adjustment. Implications for international students orientation, study abroad programs, and community-based help programs for international students were discussed."

This research used a multifaceted approach to assess lay perceptions of genetic discrimination and genetically based racial discrimination (N = 644). Two tools for use in strategic planning efforts associated with communicating about human genetics and health, the Genetic Discrimination Instrument (GDI) and the Genetically Based Racism Instrument (GBRI), were derived. The GDI emerged as having five dimensions associated with lay perceptions of genetic discrimination. The GBRI was found to be uni-dimensional. Scale validation activities supported the tools concurrent and discriminant validity characteristics. Significant differences between Blacks (n = 309) and Whites (n = 277) on the Criminal Control, Social Reproduction and Organizational Rights factors, as well as the GBRI were found. We recommend application of these screening tools prior to national dissemination of messages associated with genes and disease susceptibility, including school and university-based curricula."

Western governments and non-governmental organizations since the early 1990s have promoted democratic journalism as a force for liberalizing authoritarian regimes and containing Islamic fundamentalism in Central Asia. Since the early 1990s, professional journalists and journalism educators from the West have conducted trainings for journalism professionals, journalism academics, and journalism students throughout the former Communist Bloc, emphasizing traditional American news values, reporting techniques, and journalism ethics. By incorporating examples from media history of the struggle to establish and maintain press freedom in the United States and in nations with similar press systems, they can illustrate that the road to a free press in any nation is serpentine. This paper discusses how some experienced American journalist-educators convey relevant precedents from U.S. colonial history, the early decades of independence, post-World War II, evolving libel law, and ethics into professional journalism trainings they lead in Central Asia."

The ability of terrorists to conduct cyberwarfare is largely unknown, but the potential for the disruption of life worries many policymakers. In searching for precedent to anticipate the potential impact of a cyberwar, it is important to identify modes of conflict that are useful against asymmetrically matched opponents and conflict that strikes at the economy. I suggest that an effective model for looking at cyberwarfare is that of maritime guerre de course or commerce warfare. Moreover, the maritime paradigm provides a useful dialog with which to examine possible future trends in cyberwarfare beyond effects including the impact of technological innovation, sociological and historical trends, and tactics."

Such claims, and the investigations that rest upon them, necessarily focus on the temporal aspects of communication. That is, process, pattern, and cyclicity are apparent only over time. However, what go unexaminedif referenced (see VanLear [1996])are the communicative aspects of temporality. In the following pages, each of these suppositions is developed in light of the other through examining the entrainment processes that characterize organizational temporality. Consistent with VanLears (1996) five basic assumptions of a process model of communication and employing Monge and Kalmans (1996) set of key terms to assist in the development of related frameworks, the present project extends a model of organizational temporality introduced elsewhere (XXXX & XXXX, 2003) vis-à-vis a typology of activity cycles that characterize work processes."
2005-0376,"Cynicism, Participation, and the Media",cial Capital and Political Trust,Political Communication,,,Paper,"Cynicism, Participation, and the Media",Social Capital and Political Trust,"There is a long track record of efforts to get citizens in the United States to become more civically engaged and responsive to problems in their communities, region and nation (Sirianni & Friedland 2001, Kurpius 2003, Putnam 2000, Patterson 1993, Merritt 1998, Rosen 2001). A common belief is that cynical citizens are more likely to sit on the sidelines complaining about the problem but seeing no solution and certainly not participating in any effort to find solutions. Often the media are blamed for the cynical mood of citizens (Jamieson and Cappella 1994). From this perspective, cynicism is considered to be the evil eating away at the core (or diffuse) trust Americans have in their public institutions and officials to solve public problems (Nye, 1997).
This study attempts to clarify this important area of research using a survey of 1,200 randomly selected Louisiana residents to improve our understanding of media attentiveness and use, political trust, and civic participation. We improve on the previous literature in the following ways. First, we look specifically at the impact of the media on participation in local community organizations in addition to more traditional measures of voter turnout. Second, we look more specifically at how media use impacts respondent evaluations of self-identified most important problems, including whether the problem is improving or worsening and whether the respondent has confidence that state government officials will effectively address the problem."

This practice of trading music was an early predecessor of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading, a revolutionary use of Internet technology with far-reaching social and economic implications. P2P is generally regarded as the cause of a pitched legal battle between the music industry and consumers, but it has become just another means by which Deadheads have extended their practice of permitted trading. This paper examines Deadhead bootleg trading as described on several fans websites. Bootleg trading highlights the interplay between media producers and consumers in negotiating the meaning of media products and the functioning of subcultures in the face of marginalization by the mainstream. In contrast to the recording industrys efforts to label trading as piracy, bootlegging also highlights the social value of decentralized music distribution."

While the public finds their own meaning through looking at photographs, and can be empathetic to the lives that are lost, they are insulated from the messengers that shoulder cameras and document the horrific ordeals. Viewers are unaware if its a man or woman behind the lens, oblivious to choices taking place for these professionals who have to decide how, or even if they should, frame the gory faces of war. We fail to consider that photojournalists act as our ethical witnesses, responsible for some of the death we see, or dont see.

As a female photographer and documentary filmmaker, I believe that the opportunities for women photojournalists to see the frontlines and capture death are critical components to creating a discourse on womens visual representations of war. Although both male and female photographers offer sensitive and provocative imagery, with the influx of woman in combat zones, and their participation in shaping political agendas, it is important to explore the new moral philosophies that are influencing war photography today. Does more women at work on the frontlines mean there are more ethical decisions being made? How is the boys club mentality of photojournalism being altered? Essentially, does gender matter when one is expected to capture death?"

With data collected in the context of the 2002 German televised debates we demonstrate that evaluations of the candidates' debate performances are highly instable. The reason is that voters compare their own perceptions to the views represented in their social networks and the interpretations provided by the mass media. To avoid dissonances, they adjust their opinions in accordance with the other information channels. While interpersonal communication is more important for the adjustment process after the first debate, mass communication had a greater impact in the context of the second debate."

The public sphere is conceptualised as a space where citizens interact through their acts of public communication. Such public communications are an important source of the Europe-building process, because they potentially provide public inputs to the elite-led processes of European political institutional integration. Our empirical findings show that British public debates are internalised within the nation-state rather than creating links to supra- or trans-national European polities. In addition, we find relatively low levels of civil society engagement compared to that of political elites, and a high level of political competition between the two major political parties, Labour and Conservative. Overall, we argue that elite ambivalence to Britains position within the European Union has created this climate of uncertainty and political competition over Europe."

At issue is whether various forms of CMC enable or deter successful deception. Synchronous (real-time) CMC was hypothesized to foster more involvement and mutuality during communication, more credibility for team members, and hence less detection of deception when it was present. Team performance was hypothesized to suffer under deception due to deceivers capitalizing on synchronous communication to build their credibility. Two-person teams conducted a decision-making task in real time (synchronous) or over the course of several days (asynchronous). In half of the pairs, one party was asked to be deceptive. Participants in the synchronous mode were perceived as showing more involvement and mutuality, and viewed their partners in a more favorable light, than participants in the asynchronous mode. Deceivers portrayed themselves as more credible than truthtellers. Participants in the deceptive condition made poorer decisions than participants in the truthful condition. Implications for CMC and future study are discussed."

Reillys article generated a great deal of controversy surrounding the administration and the athletic department at the University of Colorado (CU) and among the public at-large. Through narrative analysis, we explore the concurrent and competing narratives of various actors in this story. We work towards understanding how various public statements and media articles (re)create multiple narratives including that of athletics, the CU football program, and the societal culture of rape. In doing so, we draw special attention to the unique role of communication and rhetorical scholars in (de)constructing public discourse surrounding these narratives."

Univision Communications Inc. & Hispanic Broadcasting Corp.,The Effect of Media Ownership on Localism and Diversity: Measuring the Impact,"In September 2003, one of the most impactful media mergers in history was approved, placing up to 80% of the Spanish language broadcast market in some cities under one corporate umbrella. Most of America never noticed, because this merger did not affect the majority; it affected the largest minority in the United States today, the Hispanic community. Of this group, up to 65% prefer Spanish-language media, the majority of which will now come from one corporation, Univision. In approving this consolidation, the FCC ignored product market findings by the Department of Justice as well as its own policy precedent, which has repeatedly made exceptions and provisions for Spanish programming, all in the interest of promoting content and ownership diversity. In this paper, product market tests and multiple ownership rules are applied to United States v. Univision Inc. and Hispanic Broadcasting Corp., with the conclusion that a separate product market should exist for Spanish language media."
2005-0385,Defining Deliberation: Key Determinants and Distinct Dimensions,Deliberation: The Power of Talk,Political Communication,,,Paper,Defining Deliberation: Key Determinants and Distinct Dimensions,Deliberation: The Power of Talk,"This study explicates the concept of deliberation both theoretically and empirically. We argue that deliberation is a concept that involves the willingness to listen to others, to express opinions, and to speak out when facing contradictory viewpoints. We demonstrate that different key determinants influence different dimensions of public deliberation. Drawing on national survey data and a carefully constructed theoretical model, we generated a structural equation model that examined three dimensions of deliberation and their different sets of antecedents. Specifically, the findings suggest that individual predisposition, heterogeneity of discussion network, media use, and strength of opinion have different effects on respondents willingness to speak out in a public forum, willingness to express a conflicting view in a public forum, and willingness to listen to conflicting viewpoint. Additionally, this study sets the stage for a research agenda that focuses on specific features of public deliberation instead of the dichotomous conceptualization of mere participation in political conversation found throughout much of the research on this concept."

No doubt an in-depth analysis of Koreas experience with libel law vs. press freedom will serve as a referential point on what a consolidating democracy with little libertarian culture may do in balancing reputation with press freedom.
The first part of this Article focuses on various special press statutes and on libel laws of Korea. The Articles next part discusses several leading libel cases of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of Korea. The last section of this Article offers the authors critical analysis of the Korean governments legislative and judicial experimentation in balancing the freedom of the press with reputational interest."

The research is directed towards respondents with two different media and cultural experiences. The first are interviewees who are simply familiar with American prime time and the second are those who are acquainted with both the American and the Indian content. The research questions address specifics of representations associated with the American and the Indian media: the roles women play on prime time, whether the viewers can associate with the characters, possible difference between prime time representations and reality as well as possible overlaps between ways of reading media's constructions of femininity in these culturally different stage sets. Findings in the study acknowledge more similarities in analyzing gender reproductions between viewers familiar with American and Indian media, rather than distinct perceptions of gender images in the respective cultural settings. Most of the overlaps in observing gender representations on prime time have evolved from the viewer's unconscious narration of media experiences rather than categorically referring to the similarities."

We test a model of adolescent development by applying the perspective of deliberative democracy to civic learning. We also explore the differential effects of curriculum components to identify the most consequential learning experiences. Data are derived from a panel study of student-parent dyads interviewed after the 2002 intervention and again one year later. Kids Votings immediate effects were systematic across multiple dimensions of media use and cognition, discussion, and opinions and behavior. One year later, curriculum effects persisted in news attention, issue salience, encouraging parents to pay attention to news, multiple dimensions of discussion, and partisan identification. In a majority of the indicators, the curriculum influence was actually stronger one year later, suggesting that Kids Voting prepares adolescents for long-term receptivity to political stimulation."

However public relations is more than the public relations industry. This paper returns to the definition of democracy, placing it firmly within an historical context, from ancient Athenian processes to todays mass society and considers the role that public relations can play in the context of democratic dialogue. Positioning public relations and democracy within the one theoretical framework, we suggest public relations is more than a tool for business and government. We seek to continue the discussion about the nature of the public sphere, arguing that a range of public spheres, both strong and weak or dominant and counter-dominant, are essential to the balance of democracy. Finally this paper looks at how the use of public relations processes within the third sector and by individual and collective citizen-hackers shows that new movements and technologies are levelling the playing field and creating new forms of democratic discourse, debate and decision-making."

Affirmative Action and Definitions of Blackness,"Race, Gender, and Ideology","Law professor Maria Consuelo OBrien Hyltons parents are a Black Cuban woman and a White Australian man. When Northwestern began considering her for a position at the law school, Black and Latino student groups protested her candidacy and claimed she would not represent or meet their needs. The Hylton case made its way into major newspapers headlines and sparked heated debate. In particular, reporters and commentators gravitated towards the perceived irony of Blacks calling other Blacks inauthentic. This, I argue, fit in with two recurrent themes that were strong in mid-1990s mainstream media: judging which (if any) black people deserve affirmative action, and an interest in conflicts within the Black public sphere."

Most contemporary approaches to exploring organizational relationships are useful for capturing the state of a focal organizational relationship at a single point in time or over a limited period at best. Such approaches have limited utility for research involving multiple relationships over an extended timeframe. While organizational relationships are almost exclusively studied and understood using the perceptions of the parties in the relationships, this study describes organization-activist relationships using observable relationship processes, that is, information flows. Organizations and activists signal the state of their relationships in their information flows, specifically public statements about their shared issues of concern that are reported by the news media. It is from these published relationship-signaling statements that the state of these relationships at multiple intervals is interpreted and measured using a conflict continuum. This paper reports the findings of the analysis of relationship-signaling statements made by Australias major banks and their activist publics and published by the media from 1981 to 2001. It involved the content analysis of more than 6, 500 newspaper articles. The findings of this study call into question the value of advice that encourages organizations to deal with issues by seeking to avoid engaging with their activist publics and by downplaying issues in the media."

Eleven aspiring musicians between the ages of 15 and 21 were interviewed to determine why they were pursuing music and fame as a career and to explore the motives behind their desire. The data were analysed using techniques developed in grounded theory while also drawing on ideas from discourse analysis. As a validity check, a further analysis was conducted using two participants who were slightly older than the others and who had more experience of the music industry. Participants presented a variety of reasons for their pursuit of fame, which were grouped into six main themes. One particularly pertinent discourse was the idea that fame represents a form of journey, although the precise destination is unclear, and it is suggested that this uncertainty may be an important factor in many celebrities subsequent disenchantment with the fame experience."

While the participants had different job functions and different levels of comfort with technology, all had on their desktops paper artifacts related to the change in the system. Many of these items were placed on or around their computer monitors, and were used as reminders, process summaries, indicators of system failures of poor interface design, or temporary, transitional information. Individuals were often reluctant to dispose of paper related to the old system even though they no longer used the system to process information. More generally, conceptual analyses identified several underlying dimensions of paper desktop artifacts: paper/electronic, materiality/complexity, forms as organizational media, and artifact as meta-information. Physical desktop artifacts play a useful role in individuals' adjustment to a new system, can provide valuable information for systems analysis and evaluation, and should be included in research on both traditional and new communication and information systems."

The main justification for this minimal effects hypothesis was the fact that scholars found it impossible to measure and identify substantial persuasion effects that are the outcome of a campaign. But for more than a decade now scholars who study political campaigns hypothesize that political campaigns have a strong persuasive effect on the voters. They argue that such persuasive effects could hardly be measured because most major political campaigns are relatively balanced, and therefore have a canceling-out effect. They hypothesize that it would be possible to measure the effects of persuasion in an extremely asymmetric campaign, but they hardly find any such major campaigns in modern times. The campaign over Sharons disengagement plan in Israel was extremely imbalanced, and is therefore an interesting and important example from a theoretical point of view. The analysis provides evidence for persuasion effects of the campaign."

Using the micro-longitudinal (panel) data of 66 start-up basic cable programming networks, this study identifies several factors which influence on the speed of the growth of the start-up cable programming networks. The estimation results confirms the conventional belief in the cable television industry that several factors such as the ownership status of the start-up network, the timing of entry, the programming expenditure, and the first-mover advantages have significant impacts on the speed of the growth of the start-up cable network. In particular, this study assures the concerns of the regulators on the diversity of the cable television programming by revealing that the independent start-up cable networks, which are affiliated with neither the cable systems nor the established cable networks, are growing slower than the cable networks which are affiliated with."

We test the hypothesis that the spending/consumption profile of an audience over all products induces the advertiser demand and thus determines the audiences value in the advertising market, inter alia, using the data of 1997 national network prime-time programs. It is found that ad prices are significantly correlated with product purchase profile accounting for products sale profit potentials, even with other value factors controlled for."

Certainty of punishment, stigma of the label, awareness of the laws and consensus with the rule were found to be negatively correlated with both current and likely future file-sharing activities. The regression analysis revealed that current file-sharing activity was best predicted by the legal factor certainty of punishment. The extra-legal factors stigma of the label and consensus with the rule also played important roles in deterring current file-sharing activities, but not as consistent as certainty of punishment. Certainty of punishment did not play an important role in predicting the likelihood of future file sharing, while stigma of label and awareness of the law played a significant role in deterring likelihood of future file sharing. The findings of this study provide an empirical basis for developing alternative strategies to deter online file sharing that involving massive users, all of whom could not be practically punished."

2005-0413,Developing a Scale to Assess Media Enjoyment,tudies in Entertainment,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Developing a Scale to Assess Media Enjoyment,Studies in Entertainment,"The purpose of this study is to use existing theory and research to develop a scale of media enjoyment. In a recent article, Nabi and Krcmar (2004) conceptualized media enjoyment as an attitude, comprising affective, cognitive and behavioral dimensions. In this study a scale of media enjoyment is developed and validated. This scale builds on the framework laid out by Nabi and Krcmar. Specifically, 16 items were developed that tap the cognitive, affective and behavioral dimensions of enjoyment. Strong convergent, discriminant and predictive validity of these dimensions is demonstrated. In addition, like an attitude, the relationship between attitude (i.e., enjoyment) and behavior (i.e., exposure) can be strengthened by making the attitude object more specific, an idea first proposed by Fishbein & Azjen (1975). Lastly, theoretical and practical implications of scale development are discussed."

This conceptual extension includes the methodological development of cultural indicators of homosexuality from television, book publishing, theatrical film, and newspaper content from 1971 to 2003. An overall composite CI index of cultural shifts toward homosexuality is also created. In addition, we use public opinion data from the 1973 to 2002 General Social Surveys to demonstrate how cultural indicators may be leading or lagging indicators of social change. Lastly, we evaluate the convergent validity of the cultivation hypothesis by comparing cultural indicators of homosexuality on television to trends in perceptions of homosexuality held by heavy, medium, and light viewers over the period of 1977 to 2002. Future directions for the conceptual and methodological development of cultural indicators are discussed."

Using the Indian broadcaster, Doordarshan, we illustrate how a public media outlet with a development mandate has responded to the new pressures and examine the consequences for development broadcasting in general. Our inquiry leads us to challenge not only the strategies of this broadcaster but also some of the assumptions by media scholars regarding development broadcasting. We conclude by advocating a new type of development broadcasting that establishes a distinct brand and plays a vital role in creating an informed citizenry."

This development of a strong social network was unexpected because the reporters were mostly competitors. This strong social bonding runs counter to the stereotype of the lone reporter working on his or her own to produce the news.

Diabetes is a chronic disease relying on glucose management to reduce risk of severe complications and early death. The ways in which the patient and doctor negotiate and construct shared meanings of glucose management holds potential to influence patient decision-making and consequentially, diabetes outcomes.
Four dyadic interactions are drawn from a larger body of data collected in a previous study with older adults. Excerpts are created, beginning after the first inquiry into glucose levels until the topic switches to a new medical concern. The transcribed excerpts are reformatted into a convention for conversation analysis and evaluated for how the parties co-construct their talk about glucose management.
Four key themes arise out of the analysis. First, doctors index diabetes control according to results of the hemoglobin A1C test, rather than to other measures that may be more salient to the patient. Second, diabetes control as it is used refers to glucose management, not disease management which would encompass much broader standards of success. Third, even though patient education is a cornerstone of improved diabetes outcomes, there was limited talk that served to education the patient using her or his knowledge or perceptions realized through self-monitoring of blood glucose. Fourth, doctors used we frequently to describe actions, preferences for desired states, or responsibility for the disease implying a presumption of sharing the disease with the patient."
2005-0418,"Diagnosing Argumentation Support for Groups, Organizations, and Communities",Organizational Communication Interactive Paper Session,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,"Diagnosing Argumentation Support for Groups, Organizations, and Communities",Organizational Communication Interactive Paper Session,"This paper proposes a theoretical approach for diagnosing the argumentation support afforded by information and communication systems for groups, organizations, and communities. Argumentation support refers to the means available for shaping, disciplining, guiding, and facilitating human interaction and reasoning. The movement to incorporate information and communication technology into a wide variety of practices and institutions for decision-making, dispute resolution, and learning raises questions as to what types of argumentation support are available and with what consequence for human interaction and reasoning. The approach developed here addresses these questions by integrating dialectical theories of argumentation with a language action perspective on information and communication systems. The result is a diagnostic scheme based on three analytic concepts: purpose, orchestration, and systemic rationality. The scheme is applied to explain the different forms of argumentation support afforded by various collaboration technologies and to interpret how, in the context of an environmental controversy, several competing groups and organizations are able to collaborate because they develop the argumentation support necessary for their collaboration. Thus, the scheme enables the articulation of (1) the argumentative affordances of social systems and technical systems, (2) the socio-technical gap between what is required socially and what can be done technically to support argumentation, and (3) the co-evolution of the social system and the technical system. The implications for integrating and developing prior theory in argumentation, information systems, and organizations are discussed."

Of the 205 participants, 121 reported having communicated their feelings to their friends. Based on both open-ended questions and scaled measures, results confirmed our hypotheses, such that individuals who expressed their dislike reported reasons reflecting the dialectics of dependence and expressiveness; moreover, people who withheld their dislike reported reasons reflecting the dialectics of independence and protectiveness. Consistent with Media Richness Theory, results also indicated significantly more people used face-to-face interactions, compared to phone, email, or Instant Messenger, to disclose their feelings to their friend. Finally, it was found that expressing dislike had significant effects on both friendship and romantic relationship quality. In terms of friendships, individuals who expressed dislike reported decreased friendship closeness, satisfaction, and likelihood of friendship continuance. In terms of romantic relationships, expressing dislike influenced the dissolution of one-third of friends romantic relationships."
2005-0420,Dialogic Public Relations Practices via Community College Websites,Public Relations Plenary Interactive Paper Session,Public Relations,,,Paper,Dialogic Public Relations Practices via Community College Websites,Public Relations Plenary Interactive Paper Session,"For more than a century, community colleges have emerged as multifaceted, comprehensive institutions, rich in their diverse curricula (Goldman & Beach, 2001). Capable of offering programs that reflect societal changes and trends, the survival and ultimate success of community colleges could not have occurred had there not been open exchange and dialogue. Building relationships  managing interdependence  is the substance of public relations theory (Grunig, Grunig & Ehling, 1992). A theoretical shift from public relations reflecting an emphasis on managing communication, to an emphasis on communication as a tool for negotiating relationships, has been taking place for some time (Kent & Taylor, 2002). Deeply rooted in philosophy and relational communication theory, Kent and Taylor (1998, 2002) argue for the inclusion of the concept of dialogue in public relations vocabulary as an important step toward understanding how organizations can build relationships that serve both organizational and public interests. The Internet and the World Wide Web have the potential to increase the velocity of the public relations process (Esrock & Leichty, 1998, 2000). The purpose of this article is to examine the Community College Web sites as forums for fostering dialogue and forming organization-public relationships. An analysis shows that the population of nineteen New Jersey community colleges is not taking full advantage of the dialogic capacities of the Internet. The implications for scholars, and practitioners, as they consider the dialogic capacity of computer mediated communication via the Internet are discussed."
2005-0421,Dialogue Endangered by Risk Society?,Public Relations Plenary Interactive Paper Session,Public Relations,,,Paper,Dialogue Endangered by Risk Society?,Public Relations Plenary Interactive Paper Session,"From an epistemological sociological perspective, the research presented in this essay endeavours to understand the emergence, diffusion and dynamics of the social processes which activate legitimising structures such as public relations and ideals of dialogue, and at the same time the social mechanisms which endanger these ideals within the context of late modern society.

The essay discusses how society has become dependent on decisions; how this has increased the awareness of society as the source of danger instead of Nature, Fate, or God as in previous societal forms, and how danger is traced back to risky organizational decisions; organizations being the prime decision makers of society. This puts pressure on organizations to continuously justify their decisions  a pressure which is sought relieved by ideals of dialogue. These ideals, however, are endangered by the social structures and irreconcilable positions of victim versus decision maker of our present risk society.

The understanding of society in general and of the increasing attribution of danger to risk is based on the theories of the prominent late modern sociologist Niklas Luhmann, whereas the analysis of the consequences to organizations and the evolutionary dynamics between the perspectives of risk and danger is based on research undertaken by the author of the essay."

This paper provides an overview of the recent dialogue on diversity and reveals the focal activity of organizational diversity as managing the contributions of different identities. The academic conceptions of four approaches to identity as offered in interdisciplinary literature on diversity are explored. A brief assessment of each approach is offered, along with discussions on theoretical challenges and future areas for scholarship."

Combining a cultural studies approach with textual analysis, this essay examines how the reality television series Worlds Apart, operates as a diplomatic front for cultural imperialism. The tourist ethnographies of American families on this show visually fetishize third world lack as proof of the superiority of the American race. Worlds Apart suggests Americas move away from insular nationalism even as it advocates the primacy of home/homeland. The technologies of this first world gaze produce what the author terms specular geographies, or a neocolonial visual mapping of nations into spaces of modernity and under-development."

We trace the cultural biography of the telephone in Kibbutz Y, with special emphasis upon the practical and symbolic transition from public to private telephones, in order to discuss the role of deliberation in the adoption of new technologies. The biographical method permits us to discuss parallel developments in the technology, the kibbutz ideology, the society, and the interrelationships between them. The paper argues that even within a community where ideology is transparent such as the Kibbutz, contradictions and dilemmas inform users discourse."

In the case of Europe, the growing diversity of cultural and media repertoires destabilize ideologies of national and cultural integration. As a consequence, living within (European) media cultures and imagining identity and belonging become terrains of cultural contestation. This paper draws from a cross-European mapping of diasporic media in order to show how commonality is imagined, but also disputed and reshaped in media and communication practices. Five themes that relate to diasporic media cultures illustrate the ways European différance is shaped in the engagement with diverse cultural and media projects. Media and communications, as producing images and narratives and as being adopted and appropriated for intercommunity and interspatial connections, play an active part in processes of identification with communities within Europe and beyond it. This discussion concludes with an argument about the possibility for more inclusive cultural politics of difference."

The realization of that potential partly depends on the capacity of such centers to offer egalitarian access to information and communication resources. Stratification of access depending on ability to pay for information and communication services is the main focus of this paper. Based on communication effects gap hypothesis research in developing countries, we adopt a motivation-contingency approach to predict that rural peasants, independently of their socioeconomic status, will be willing to pay for telecenter services if they perceive that these services are relevant to their lives. The analysis is based on a unique data set (N=750) collected with a cross-sectional contingent valuation survey in three villages of India. The logistic regression analysis of the data generally supports the research hypotheses. Data analysis suggests that community characteristics, content type, and motivation help explain the closing of socioeconomic-based communication gaps."

In the current study, participants interacted with an embodied artificial intelligence agent in immersive virtual reality. The agent either mimicked a participants head movements at a four second delay or utilized pre-recorded movements of another participant as it verbally presented an argument. Mimicking agents were more persuasive and likeable than non-mimickers despite participants inability to explicitly detect the mimic. These data are uniquely powerful because they demonstrate the ability to use automatic, indiscriminate mimicking (i.e., a computer algorithm blindly applied to all movements) to gain social influence. Furthermore, this is the first study to demonstrate social influence effects with a nonhuman, nonverbal mimicker. Implications for theories of interaction and computer-mediated communication are discussed."

Digital convergence in the information age, accompanied by the ability to access, distribute and manipulate content in an unprecedented way, has posed a serious challenge to the protection of intellectual property rights. The challenge is demonstrated in what is termed digital dilemma (NRC 2000), the coexistence of enrichment of information made possible by reduced cost and faster pace in information production, and the enrichment of means of illegal information copying, distribution and use. It comes in different forms: digital reproduction/adaptation, temporary storage, providing online access, point-to-point transmission, broadcasting, dissemination in closed user groups, decoding, screen display or use. To deal with the dilemma, current copyright regime should adapt itself to the changing technological environment. Moreover, as intellectual property rights issues have become an international concern, international organizations should play its due role to address the challenge globally."

In Austin, TX, a renowned high-tech center that still suffers from persisting inequality, this advice seemed especially appropriate. The City of Austin, along with the Department of Education and the Austin Chamber of Commerce, initiated a job training program aimed at imparting entry-level computer skills to low-income and unemployed participants. My research centered on the most basic question, which often goes unanswered due to lack of funding or interest. Are these job-training participants able to find jobs using their newly-acquired skills? I followed two separate cohorts of trainees for six months to two years after they graduated from a three-month program in this free, intensive, well-run job training initiative. The findings call into question much conventional wisdom, as there seemed to be almost no demand for such trainees in the labor market. These results necessitate that we question political strategies that aim to address labor market woes with digital divide initiatives. On the other hand, almost all the participants greatly benefited in their personally from being their new Internet competencies. Participants also reported that they had significant reduction in fear, anxiety, feelings of inadequacy regarding computers. This suggests that many concerns raised about the digital divide are indeed appropriate but care must be taken to recognize and incorporate existing societal structures into the analysis."

The study of the Internet in China, however, demonstrates that Chinas government has so far successfully constructed a digital Panopticon to counter and control the political impact of the Internet. The pervasiveness of nationalistic discourse in Chinas cyberspace also shows that the Internet does not automatically contribute to rational argument and virtual democracy."

The deliberative initiative took place in 2003 simultaneously across Israel in six regional sites over a period of six months. Participants were invited through a random stratified national sample (n=1500). They met in an opening and a concluding plenary session with senior officials of the healthcare system and in between, in 6 regional groups (in each about 20 participants) for 6 group sessions: each included time to consult with experts and dilemma activities. The issues discussed concerned equity and rationing dilemmas in healthcare services, and participants were asked to produce a group and national summary and recommendations. No consensus was required. Interview and transcript data indicate that according to participants the deliberative process had an impact on the development of their personal capacities to listen, discuss issues, and to think about moral issues, and it enabled them to meet people from diverse cultural backgrounds. Yet, from a critical perspective, the deliberative process presents several dilemmas regarding the role of the news media, recruitment and representation, the rational mode of the discussion, the quality of the views that are generated, the possible co-optation process that may take place, the impact on the system, and the introduction of a novel element, i.e., having consultants available throughout the meetings."

Within such a framework, the noise produced by early radio amateurs and computer hackers can be seen as alternating within the direct flows of capitalist information systems, a perspective that reveals a consistent historical context for adaptations of radio and computer technologies and their cultural significance. Nevertheless, acts of alternation themselves are seen as problematic in that they are mostly a-political attempts to control technology and its spaces that affirm the secrecy, surveillance, and private interests of capitalist information systems. Forms of alternation are identified through the extensive use of historical and secondary sources, and are grouped according to their adaptations of technologies (hard) and of technologically-enabled spaces (soft). The exclusive analysis of radio and computer hackers is justified through a common foundation in the shenanigans of telephone switchboard operators of the late 1870s."

We argued that such conflicts are one of the routine, situational accomplishments of everyday organizing practices that (re)construct cultures and masculinities. We examined tensions that arise in the management of joint ventures, the ways in which managerial masculinity emerged both similarly and differently across cultural groups, and ways in which culturally different enactments of managerial masculinity contributed to conflictual interactions."

This paper will propose a definition and a typology of terrorism in hopes of starting a theoretical conversation that can help to first isolate and then articulate important research questions across a variety of disciplines, as the hazards typology has done. But it is particularly relevant to the field of communication. If terrorism is, to paraphrase the scholar Brian Jenkins (1975), violence that communicates, a terrorist event from beginning to end can be seen as a disaster that communicates"

The history of the conflict dates back to the period of British rule in the sub-continent and the consequent creation of India and Pakistan as separate national entities.
News media in India and Pakistan frame the conflict as a territorial dispute, and in terms of differential religious and political ideologies in India and Pakistan; media in both countries tend to reflect the hegemonic ideals of their ruling classes. The focus of the conflict has changed over the years in each of the above dimensions: the religious angle in particular is interesting given that both countries now have right wing governments whose ideologies are sometimes classified as fundamentalist.
This paper examines the conflict in Kashmir from a religious perspective. Given the growing popularity of a Hindutva ideology and increasing communal tensions within the country, the study asks how Muslims in Kashmir, Pakistan, and India are framed with regard to the conflict. Content analysis has been used to identify news framing patterns of Muslims. Results indicate that Indian newspapers do indeed focus more on Muslims than Hindus and that news frames of Muslims tend to be a lot more negative than positive. Implications of such framing patterns are discussed with regard to the nature of communal relations (between Hindus and Muslims) in India."

Negative media portrayals of Islam and Muslims in U.S. press have, according to several scholars, contributed significantly to negative American public perception of Islam and Muslims (see Shaheen 1984 and 2001; Said 1997). Research into past newspaper coverage of Islam and Muslims is important because it may produce a better understanding of current U.S. media discourses about Islam and Muslims by discovering early discourses and discovering which have endured and why. Ultimately, research into the historical treatment of Islam and Muslims in U.S. press may help in understanding Americas concept of and approach to dealing with the cultural other. The present research studied discourses in the 1798 Worcester Spy and the 1882 New York Times. Results suggest that in 1798, a general lack of consciousness about Islam and Muslims on the part of the Worcester Spys staff seems apparent, although discourse emphasizing Islam and Muslims was found in quotes and paraphrased statements of key French and Muslim political players. Findings also suggest that in 1882, the New York Times talked about Muslims as violent fanatics, uncivilized and the Muslim world community as weak. A fourth discourse in the Times expressed a more sympathetic tone towards the Muslim cause."

What is interesting about this is how the talk extends into the personal matters of the family, such as: interpersonal relationships with the father of the baby, accountability for the pregnancy, and birth control. We look at the discursive practices in formulating problems and in accounting for and resisting such versions. In particular we focus on how participants, at times, orient to these problems in various ways as delicate matters."

The study is timely because of the recent surge in youth alcohol interventions designed to affect perceptions of norms and beliefs (Berkowitz, 2004; Musher-Eizenman & Kulick, 2003). Using three waves of telephone interviews with a nationally representative sample of 1140 U.S. youth age 14-19 at baseline, hierarchical linear modeling and structural equation modeling were conducted. Results indicate that friends approval of drinking is particularly important to youth alcohol use, but parents still have a measurable influence indirectly through youths friends and youths beliefs about alcohol. Descriptive norms about socially distant peers were less important than friends approval. Attitudes about alcohol are a more direct predictor of behavior than expectancies about the consequences of drinking."

In turn, these symptoms have been found to be related to a decrease in perceived social support by the victim. From a uses and gratifications point of view, the increase in distress and the decrease in perceived social support could well affect a victims television use. Furthermore, the compensation hypothesis (Davis & Kraus, 1989) proposes that persons with little social contact use mass media to compensate for social isolation. It could therefore be hypothesized that more use of television for reasons of companionship is related to higher levels of psychological distress and lower levels of perceived social support. The present study used a structural equation model to test this hypothesis. The sample consisted of 212 [European country] victims of crime. The results confirm the proposed relationships and hypotheses. Directions for future research are discussed."

Six physicians were videotaped during their consultations with 50 different patients at a single setting Veterans Administration Hospital. Although some ineffective or detrimental nonverbal behaviors seemed inherent with EMR use, such behaviors varied according to degree. For example, three different office spatial designs were identified and named open, closed and blocked. The open arrangement put physicians in a position to establish better eye contact and physical orientation than did the alternative closed and blocked office configurations.
Physicians who accessed the EMR and took breakpoints (short periods of no computer use and sustained eye contact with patients) used more nonverbal cues than physicians who tended to talk with their patients while continuously working on the computer. The authors suggests how breakpoints can help reduce information loss that may be associated with EMR use.
Finally, long pauses in conversational turn-taking associated with EMR use had an unexpected, positive impact on doctor-patient communication. High EMR use physicians had patients who asked more questions and participated more in the medical interview than did low EMR use physicians. The EMR tended to slow down the medical interview and gave patients a chance to think about their circumstance, symptoms, and other questions about their medical condition. Nonverbal phenomena (slow turn- taking and reduced eye contact) that are typically associated with less effective interpersonal communication were related to an increase in positive verbal exchange. Implications for medical education are discussed."

The influence of the message again depends on whether it is perceived by the recipients and whether they consider the presentation factually correct. In this theoretical concept the individual processing of the information is regarded as an intervening variable, which can minimize or maximize the impact of the news coverage. With the help of a combination of methods consisting of a content analysis of TV news and a panel survey of around 500 eligible voters before the German general election in 2002, the present investigation analyzes the influence of individual perception of television news coverage concerning two top politicians and the assessment of the accuracy of their portrayal on the changes of opinion about these two politicians. The analysis reveals: those who recognized changes in the tone of candidates presentation changed their opinion about the politicians in the corresponding direction. In contrast, the assessment of the accuracy of their presentation did not play a role."

However, little is known about the actual communication strategies are employed by organizations and about which portions of these communications are used by the news media covering the crisis. The purpose of this paper is to examine how organizations are using their Web sites in crisis communication. More specifically, it studies the actual rhetorical strategies employed by organizations when they communicate about one particular type of crisismismanagement, and which of these rhetorical strategies are then repeated by the media. It also examines the discursive strategies used by organizations through the lens of Benoit's image repair tactics."

A Social Cognitive Theory of Online Shopping Behavior,E-Commerce,"With consumers growing reliance on e-commerce, the factors influencing e-commerce behavior continue to be an important issue. Trust has often been identified as an overriding factor in e-commerce participation, but its conceptual relationships to well known predictors of behavior remain unclear. The present study was conducted among 273 college students. E-trust remained a significant predictor of intentions to participate in e-commerce, but its importance was secondary to expected outcomes and online shopping self-efficacy. Deficient self-regulation was also a significant predictor in a multiple regression analysis that explained 49% of the variance in e-commerce participation intentions."

An Exploration in to the Impact of the Number of Opinion Seekers and Opinion Leaders on Technology Attitudes and Choices,Group Impacts in Technology,"One aspect of group structure which has not received much theoretical or empirical evaluation is informal status. Status is an emergent property of formal and informal groups and implies a positive evaluation by other members of the group. In addition, the influence of the number of group members who share status has never been explored. This paper focuses on group relationships and evaluates the impact of the number of opinion seekers and opinion leaders on individual technology related attitudes and behavior. The research model was built on the social influence model presented by Fulk (1993) and tested across multiple mediating variables suggested in the social psychological literature including cohesiveness, three types of uncertainty, two levels of uncertainty, and two media types. Contrary to the dominant theoretical position, the number of opinion leaders did not influence technology attitudes. Rather, the number of opinion seekers had a significantly influence. Consistent with the literature on conformity, the influence of the number of opinion seekers was moderated by the degree of cohesiveness, type and level of uncertainty, and the type of media chosen."

However, it did not explicitly identify whether organizational information (as opposed to only product information, recruitment information or financial information) matters to stakeholders in the first place.
To fill this void, this study examines whether the addition of organizational information to recruitment or financial information enhances potential applicants or investors evaluation of a company and their intentions toward the company.
An experiment was conducted in which respondents were exposed to one of four types of corporate brochures of a fictitious company. The four types of brochures consisted of two variants of recruitment brochures (both variants including recruitment-related information such as the description of a management trainee program, salary, working conditions etc.) and two variants of financial brochures (both variants including information on financial results, share performance, dividend policy etc.). For both type of brochures, one variant included additional organizational information (such as the firms history, mission, market opportunities, social responsibility etc.) and one did not include additional organizational information.
The results demonstrate that 1) additional organizational information in a recruitment brochure positively influences potential applicants overall evaluation of a firm and, 2) this positive evaluation in turn influences their intention to apply for a job at the firm. Moreover, 3) additional organizational information in a financial brochure positively influences potential investors overall evaluation of a firm; and 4) this positive evaluation in turn influences their intention to buy shares from the firm."

Employing the concept of television channel brand equity, this paper aims to offer an explanation on how channel loyalty is developed by audiences viewing experiences. Arguing that perceived quality of television programs is a key determinant of channel brand equity, this study attempts to empirically examine the effect of perceived quality of programs on channel brand equity. A survey was conducted in metropolitan area of Seoul, Korea to get individual viewing frequency, perceived quality of the program, viewing satisfaction, and channel brand equity regarding each of 25 primetime television programs. And the structural equation modeling technique was conducted to assess the paths from perceived quality and viewing frequency to audience satisfaction and on to channel brand equity. Overall the empirical results support the research model postulated. Viewers positive evaluation of program quality, apart from viewing frequency, does contribute to build up channel brand equity. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of broadcasters long-term success in growingly competitive media market."

The 8 child-envisioned game ideas were adapted into short (roughly 3 minute) promos for hypothetical space learning games. The promos were shown to 145 middle school children without revealing the gender of the design teams. Girl games were perceived as better for learning. Rank order results showed same gender preferences. Females like girl games better and males like boy games better. However general liking measures are weaker, showing that males really like boy games, and females react negatively to violent themes. Females rated girl games closer to gender neutral than boy games, although all were overwhelmingly perceived of as for boy or for everyone rather than for girls."

An Examination of Adulthood in the 2003-04 Season,Media Representations,"Using a sample of situation comedies and dramas airing on the six broadcast networks during the 2003-04 prime-time season, this study examined how prime time characterizes the lives of adults at different points in their lives. The findings indicated that prime time over-represented individuals in their 30s and 40s while under-representing individuals 60 and older. In addition, characters in their 20s enjoyed an extended adolescence, participating in more leisure and sexual activities than any other age cohort. In contrast, characters in their 40s and 50s wielded greater occupational power and were leaders. When characters 60 and older were seen at all, they wielded less occupational power and were less likely to be leaders than those in mid-life, and were less sexually active and had fewer leisure activities than characters in their 20s."

The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) is used to relate and explore the concepts in terms of DTCA involvement, healthcare involvement, cue usage, overall media use, and exposure to DTCA. A model is proposed which posits that healthcare involvement will predict central cue use which will predict DTCA involvement. The influence of exposure to DTCA and overall media use on the model is also examined, along with the effect of use of specific mediums. A survey of college undergraduates was conducted to obtain data. Results show that healthcare involvement does predict central cue use. However, DTCA involvement is not predicted by central cue use. Exposure to DTCA predicts both types of involvement, while a negative relationship between media use and central cue use was also discovered. A majority of respondents also indicated that they would use DTCA in a discussion with their doctor, and those who would look for more information about a drug in an ad would use the Internet, go to their doctor, or talk with friends, family and neighbors."

A Comparison of the US Presidential Debates 2004 and the German TV-duels 2002,The Content and Viewing of Televised Debates,"The elections for the 15h German Bundestag in 2002 saw the introduction of a new media format, the so-called TV-Duelle. German media coverage stressed that this new addition to the German campaign communication mix was mainly due to the general Americanization trend in political communication. While the literature on US presidential debates is vast , comparative studies are rare.
This paper aims at comparing the history, functions and the formats of televised political debates in both countries, applying and further developing the functionalist paradigm of campaign communication, originally conceived by Bruce Gronbeck. A major finding of this paper is that the German TV-duels are by far different from the American Presidential Debates. The German debates cannot be considered to be an americanized TV-product. Rather the paper suggests that the German debates follow a logic of their own which is intentionally directed at serving the politicians and especially the broadcasting medias interests, and not those of the German voters. The German TV-debates can thus be characterized as choreographed or as media-media-events. By comparison the US Presidential Debates can be characterized as mediated events which serve both the information and the participation function of debates better. In its conclusion the paper discusses similarities and differences in formats and functional performance of political debates in the two countries."

The outcomes of these two experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the DAC relative to other compliance-gaining techniques known to be effective. In Experiment 1 the DAC was found to be more effective than the pooled data from the door-in-the-face (DITF) technique and the placebic information (PI) technique. In Experiment 2 the DAC was found to be more effective than the DITF, PI, and foot-in-the-door (FITD) techniques. The effect of the DAC was consistent across experiments, as well as producing relatively higher compliance-gaining rates. Moreover, because the contextual features of two experiments differed substantially, the effect occurred under heterogeneous conditions. Directions for subsequent tests of the DAC are discussed."

While these areas of intellectual inquiry are not necessarily mutually exclusive, research in the respective arenas has made halting progress in drawing on common insights to make epistemological advances. This paper posits that focusing on dyadic communication aspects of these areas is essential to better understanding socially constructed meanings of development within the context of human and organizational communication. Attention is accorded to the dyadic interactions among employees in NGOs and the ways that communication between personnel in these organizations and the target populations can be structured to better serve a communitys development needs."

Prior research has demonstrated that those favoring a rational thinking style process threat-related information such that they are rendered less apprehensive by it. Previous studies have found that high rationals experienced less apprehension than did lows when graphic representations of increasingly threatening trends over time displayed low rates of increase during their recent history; however, when rates of increase were high, both high and low rationals were equally apprehensive. In Experiment 1, individuals were presented with graphs of unspecified threatening trends showing linear or non-linear growth. The graphs were presented either statically or they developed dynamically. High rationals demonstrated less apprehension than lows in response to the non-linear function showing recent, explosive growth. High and low rationals reported similar levels of apprehension in response to static presentations of the trends, but low rationals were more apprehensive than highs when the trends were presented dynamically. A four-way interaction among function type, rationality, experientiality, and presentation mode emerged when ratings of the threats seriousness were analyzed. Experiment 2 employed two specific threats and the same independent variables as Experiment 1, but revealed no significant presentation mode or experientiality effects. High rationals showed lower levels of apprehension in response to both the linear function and the non-linear function showing early explosive growth. Low rationals were equally apprehensive across all functions. Implications for the processing general versus specific threats, the nature of graph processing schemata, and CEST are considered."
2005-0471,Eating our Young: Hypercritical Supervisory Communication and Assertiveness in the Nurse Training Process,Dysfunctional Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Eating our Young: Hypercritical Supervisory Communication and Assertiveness in the Nurse Training Process,Dysfunctional Organizational Communication,"Connecting supervisory communication with nurses patient care errors, this study hypothesizes nurse supervisors communicate with practicing and student nurses in an often hypercritical manner. Research questions explore the extent of negative nurse training, and genders (masculine-feminine) role in communication perceptions. Eighty-four survey participants discussed communication patterns during their nursing education and training experiences. Results indicate correlations between years in profession and supervisor supportive levels, as well as supervisor supportive levels and nurses patient error ratings. Nurses patient errors are related to supervisory communication, occasionally leading to patient death. Finally, stepwise multiple regression analysis indicates a model with supervisor participants likelihood to criticize a subordinate being most significantly related with stress ratings of their nurse training and education experiences. This transference cycle of negative communication is similar to child abuse cycles where abused children become abusive parents. Suggestions for future researchers of supervisory-subordinate communication and health care policy makers are provided."

It particularly investigates how US-China economic ties influence the coverage about China in the New York Times. International news coverage is measured by quantity of stories, prominence and valence. A method of content analysis is used. Non-content statistical data are also used to indicate US-China economic relations. The study proposes and tests three hypotheses. It confirms that systemic economic determinants are important factors predicting international news coverage and proposes an international level of analysis of media content."

This study advances research on media literacy by testing the effectiveness of three variations of a media literacy lesson over time. Participants (199 children in 4th or 5th grade) were randomly assigned to one of three intervention treatments or a control. All intervention treatments contained the same media literacy concepts with the aim of reducing the negative effects of media violence. The format of the intervention was manipulated by 1) a media literacy lesson in lecture format, 2) a lesson with an added cognitive activity, or 3) a lesson to remove the potential 3rd person obstacle. The children had their aggressive tendencies measured at 4 points in time. Results indicate that when the children participated in a cognitive activity after receiving the lesson, they experienced a reduction in willingness to use aggression, but the same exact lesson without the cognitive activity led to an increase willingness to use aggression. Our longitudinal results indicated that children receiving a lesson without a cognitive activity might remain more willing to use aggression over time."

The movement towards globalization and integration has transformed the nature and conduct of inter-national relations and diplomatic communication; hence a renewed interest in Public Diplomacy. The purpose of this paper is to revisit and examine the adequacy of the existing principle and practice of public diplomatic communication, and to make suggestions on developing more effective approaches to communicating with foreign publics. Specifically, this effort includes three tasks. First, we will explore the characteristics of national reputation which underpins the very notion of public diplomacy, and why it matters. Second, we will question the basic assumptions and practices in public diplomacy in light of the changing international context. Third, we will call for leveraging concepts in marketing and branding to enhance the effectiveness of public diplomatic communication."

Eighty college students affective orientation was measured and approximately two weeks later 59 of these students (plus 5 additional students) participated in a laboratory study in which they played one of two video games that differed in violent content. Participants played the video game alone for 10 minutes after which they performed a word completion task and judged the researchers competence, courteousness, and deservingness of financial support. The hypotheses were partially supported in that participants who played the violent video game rated the researcher as less courteous and less deserving of financial support than did participants who played the nonviolent video game, and affective orientation and the video game condition interacted to predict evaluations of courteousness and deservingness of financial support."

Nine commercials were edited into music across two conditions: cluttered (3 breaks of 3 ads) or group (one break of 9). The music depended upon participant age, those 18-25 hearing Top 40 music and those 25-54 hearing Country. During presentation a subset of participants across conditions had physiological responses recorded. Following presentation, all completed attitude questionnaires and memory tests. Results show negative attitudes and physiological irritation toward ads delivered in a single break compared to those in shorter, more frequent breaks. This was especially true for older listeners."

Previous research suggests that the sensation seeking personality is associated with adventurous and stimulating leisure preferences. Based on the elaboration likelihood model, it was expected that framing a travel destination in terms of stimulation would exert greater influence on high sensation seekers, whereas framing in terms of tranquility would strongly influence low sensation seekers. Results show that framing in terms of stimulation make high sensation seekers (HSS), compared to low sensation seekers (LSS), react more favorably to the messages and travel destination. However, there are no significant differences between HSS and LSS when exposed to messages framed in terms of tranquility. In addition, no significant interaction between message framing and audience personality is found. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed."

Overall, high threat PSAs elicited more message rejection as well as more message acceptance than did low threat PSAs regardless of sensation-seeking level. These results raise the possibility of a concurrent dual process of danger control and fear control for some health topics. HSSs showed more message rejection and lower intentions to initiate interpersonal communication about quitting or reducing than did low sensation seekers (LSSs) regardless of message threat level. Possible explanations for HSSs message rejection related to the analysis of existing anti-smoking television PSAs which showed that most anti-smoking PSAs did not provide young adults with alternatives to smoking."

Anti-Gay Attitudes

Abstract

A series of factors, including religious beliefs, liberal-conservative ideologies, political partisanship, critical thinking skills, and mass media, are examined in the present study in terms of whether they contribute to citizens attitudes toward homosexuals and womens status. Christian fundamentalism, which is an ideology, and the lack of support for equality, which is a value, are the strongest predictors of anti-gay and anti-women stands. Two variables concerning mass media, surprisingly, appear to have little effect on such attitudes. Implications for equal rights activists are discussed."
2005-0480,Effects of Informational Utility and Exemplification on Selective Exposure to Health News,Media Messages and Health,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,Effects of Informational Utility and Exemplification on Selective Exposure to Health News,Media Messages and Health,"The current investigation examines the effects of three media message characteristics on selective exposure to health news reports: a) magnitude of the described health threat, b) efficacy to prevent this threat, and c) incorporation of concrete case descriptions versus abstract base-rate information (exemplification). In a field setting, participants browsed through an online health news magazine that featured four manipulated and four unmanipulated articles. Time span for browsing was set to four minutes, and selective exposure behavior was unobtrusively logged.
All three message factors combined were found to influence how much time news readers spent on various health reports. When only one of the factors of magnitude or efficacy is high, articles with concrete case descriptions instigated longer reading times. However, when the informational utility was high on both these dimensions, then news consumers spent more time on articles with abstract base-rate information, as they were apparently willing to engage more in in-depth processing of complex information."

In a 2 (participant sex: male vs. female) x 2 (partner character: male vs. female) x 2 (experientiality: low vs. high) between-subjects experiment, participants played a trivia game with an ostensible partner via computer, represented by a sex-marked character. Consistent with Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory, high experientials were more likely than lows to infer the partners sex from arbitrary characters, which appears to stem from greater attention to salient visual cues and stereotypical thinking as evidenced in greater conformity to the male- than female-charactered partners. Implications for the Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE) are discussed."

The results of this study confirm that late night comedy does influence candidate image and behavioral intentions, but in ways that often defy conventional wisdom. While candidate appearances on late night talk shows enhance candidate image and monologue jokes derogate feelings toward candidates, late night political parodies actually enhance rather than worsen candidate image."

In two experiments, this study explores the potential effects of music genre and tempo on physiological arousal in a systematic way. In the first experiment, fast- and slow-paced rock and classical music excerpts were compared to silence in evaluating arousal via skin conductance. The second experiment compared fast and slow rock, classical, and swing excerpts using similar techniques. Results indicate that increased tempo leads to increased physiological arousal. However, other genre-specific musical features may override the effects of tempo in increasing music intensity, and therefore arousal. Implications of the results for extended research and music applications are discussed."

In Experiment 1, participants (N = 30) played a computer game either directly without any intervention or after watching a 5-minute narrative movie about the main game character. The results showed that watching the narrative movie positively influence game players feelings of presence, and their evaluation and enjoyment of the game. The effects of narrative on game evaluation and enjoyment were mediated by the players feelings of presence (physical, spatial, social, and self presence). In Experiment 2, participants (N = 24) played a computer game after reading either the script of the narrative movie of the game, or a script of non-narrative contents such as the technological requirement of the game. The results of Experiment 2 almost perfectly replicated those of Experiment 1 and indicated the existence of strong narrative effects in computer-game playing. Implications of the current study to the study of presence and the design of computer games are discussed."

Agenda setting (McCombs & Shaw, 1972), priming (Druckman, 2004; Iyengar & Kinder, 1987), framing (Shah, Watts, Domke, & Fan, 2002), economic cues (Hetherington, 1996), issue ownership (Petrocik, 1996; Petrocik, Benoit, & Hansen, 2003), conflict oriented news (Cappella & Jamieson, 1997), and horse race news (Patterson, 1993) are examples of such greedy concepts. Usually these concepts and the hypotheses based upon them are viewed apart. This paper presents a simultaneous test of hypotheses that center around many different greedy concepts.
The data to test the hypotheses derive from a daily content of the news, in combination with an eight wave panel study from the weeks preceding the 2003 elections in the Netherlands. The data allow for a test of a pooled regression analysis model with combinations of parties, weeks and respondents as the units of analysis.
The results show that the greedy concepts do not exclude but rather supplement each other. Political momentum, which can be obtained by attributions of successes in the media (by horse race news) appears to be the most decisive factor to explain short term shifts in party preferences, followed by setting the agenda with owned issues."

To better understand the impact of newspaper coverage of cancer prevention on public knowledge, this study attempts to update and expand our understanding of how the public learns important cancer prevention information from newspapers, confirming self-reported associations between news exposure and cancer prevention knowledge with updated descriptions of newspaper coverage of cancer risks. Our data comes from The National Cancer Institutes HINTS survey data and preliminary data from an ongoing content analysis of cancer news coverage from the same time period (2003). Using the HINTS survey data, we found that attention to health news was significantly associated with knowledge about cancer risks associated with food, smoking, and exercise, but not for knowledge about sun or alcohol. These associations between news exposure and cancer knowledge, although small, were true even after considering differences based on gender, race, age, income, and education. Using preliminary data from our own content analysis (N = 2,185), we found that the newspapers pay relatively little attention to modifiable cancer risks in general. However, there is greater newspaper attention to tobacco and diet than exercise, sun, and alcohol. These findings generally conform to the findings of the survey data, and provide a nice validation of self-reported measures of media exposure."

Based on attributional theory, perceived controllability, responsibility of obesity, and helping behavior toward obese people were measured as outcome variables of the three different news types. In the genetic influence type news condition, participants read news articles that summarize genetic research findings that link genes as a cause of a disease (e.g., obesity). In the behavioral influence type news condition, subjects read news articles that report scientific research results that suggest behavior (e.g., exercise or diet) as a cause of the disease. Finally, in the complex type news condition, participants read news articles that were based on the genetic type news report yet had some additional information suggesting behavioral possibility. No significant main effects of the three news types were found. However, significant interaction between news types and audiences prior cognition (i.e., health control beliefs) on disease controllability, responsibility, and helping behavior were found. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are further discussed."

It is an application of the limited capacity model to the Internet, and also adopts dimensional theory of emotion. It is predicted that positive pop-up images will elicit slower secondary task reaction time compared to negative pop-up images when arousal is controlled. It is also predicted that the viewing time for positive pop-up images will be longer than that of negative ones when the arousal levels are controlled to be relatively high, resulting with better memory for positive pop-up images."

Participants rationality was assessed by the Rational-Experiential Inventory. Stories of SARS were manipulated to be either severe or non-severe, and with context or without context. Two experiments using identical manipulations and measurement instruments were conducted, one in the US and one in China. Among high rationality individuals, contextual information was effective in assuaging apprehension, but only in China where the perceived threat was serious. However, story attributes consistently affected story evaluation. Findings were discussed in terms of how rationality affects health information processing in response to changes in perceived risks and how story attributes contribute to the effectiveness of health communication."

To test these hypotheses, a two-year panel study using an undergraduate sample was conducted. Cross-lagged path models showed that exposure to sexually objectifying television measured during year 1 increased trait self-objectification during year 2 for both women and men. At the same time, trait self-objectification during year 1 decreased exposure to sexually objectifying television during year 2, suggesting that both male and female participants selectively avoided sexually objectifying television based on antecedent trait self-objectification. Moreover, exposure to sexually objectifying television and magazines increased body surveillance for men only. The discussion focuses on implications for gender."
2005-0505,Effects of Survey Question Order on Evaluation of News Media,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,Political Communication,,,Paper,Effects of Survey Question Order on Evaluation of News Media,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,"Questions typically asked in public opinion surveys were placed in six survey versions differing only in the order of questions. Experimental subjects (N=147) responded to three of these six versions, each at a different time. Placement of questions affected respondents ratings of the news media. Specifically, respondents ratings of the news media declined when subjects experienced prior difficulty answering political questions, and declined further when subjects both experienced prior difficulty and, prior to that, reported how politically interested they considered themselves to be. The experience of having difficulty answering political questions appears to have been diagnostic to respondents. Respondents who experienced difficulty in answering questions apparently blamed the media for failing to help keep them informed. Those respondents who first reported their political interest and then had difficulty answering political questions were especially likely to seize on the media as responsible for failing to keep them informed.

The study first reported that self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and social influence were inter-correlated to each other. Second, this study adapted these variables to explain students smoking behavior and found that that students cigarette use is inter-determined by their appraisals of their capabilities to refrain from smoking, the expected outcomes of smoking, and the perceptions of peer pressures and friends cigarette use as behavioral models. Finally, this study found that students in later stages of change attained higher levels of self-efficacy, outcome efficacy, and lower levels of social influence. As a preliminary study, this research provides information about college students perceived attitudes and ability to refuse smoking, which should be valuable for further school-based anti-smoking intervention."

The governments of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) are no exception. In 2000, all 10 member countries of ASEAN signed the e-ASEAN Framework Agreement, whose aim is to facilitate the establishment of an ASEAN information infrastructure in the region. The ASEAN Information Infrastructure would link ASEAN with other major ICT networks in the region and in the world, such as the Asia-Pacific Information Infrastructure and the Global Information Infrastructure.

Despite the importance of e-government to ASEAN, only one study has so far analyzed e-government initiatives in the ASEAN region.

This study sought to build on Hollidays first study by seeking to assess the development of e-government in the ASEAN region, the approaches to e-government that ASEAN countries are taking, best practices from the experiences of this diverse region, and the impact of political and regulatory factors on e-government initiatives in four ASEAN countries: Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.

Finally, we offer a conceptual framework, linking environmental factors (political, regulatory, infrastructural) in ASEAN with e-government initiatives."
2005-0508,Emergent Complexity and the Role Attributes of Media,cial and Cognitive Networks,Information Systems,,,Paper,Emergent Complexity and the Role Attributes of Media,Social and Cognitive Networks,"This paper explores the roles people play in enabling the smooth operation of a medium. A role based typology of media is developed using a dataset that compares 18 generic roles across 167 distinct media. Seven distinct role-based clusters of media, personal interactive media, personal art media, group interactive media, intermediate scale media, production art media, moderated interactive performances, and role intensive media, are identified within a two dimensional solution. When the clusters are viewed as endpoints within these dimensions, several emergent solutions to role complexity in media are observed, each of which appears to be a consequence of a different kind of complexity. One of these solutions, parallel complexity, mirrors the hierarchical subassemblies proposed by Simon (1969) as the single emergent solution to complexity. The other emergent solutions to role complexity, serial complexity and floor contention, have very different role profiles and diverge in important ways from Simons model of hierarchical subassemblies. Four research questions are satisfied by the results. The typology successfully groups structurally similar media. The structures reflect general solutions to problems that are encountered in the operation of media. A fundamental set of problems, different kinds of complexity, engenders the solutions. Finally, the typology is found to have practical value in discussions of media convergence, as it suggests that divergent role structures may make it difficult to merge companies that manage media that entail different kinds of role structures."

This paper applies the principles of network and emergence theory to weblogs, and proposes a hybrid weblog model that uses decentralized and centralized production methods. The result is a form of media that would enable the participation of the public that civic journalism encourages while still upholding journalism's traditional ethical standards."
2005-0510,Emotional Congruency and the Realism of Media Stories,The Best of Information Systems: The Top 4 Papers,Information Systems,,,Paper,Emotional Congruency and the Realism of Media Stories,The Best of Information Systems: The Top 4 Papers,"Earlier studies indicated that in a media narrative a characters expression of an unexpected emotion might be related to realism judgments. However, it seemed plausible that people might try to mentally fill in information to explain the incongruent emotion. Other studies raised the possibility that incongruent information might actually add to a sense of realism. Two experiments indicate that this is probably not the case. Incongruent emotions were consistently judged as less real, even when they were of the same general valence as the congruent emotion. This did not seem to be modified by the amount of mental capacity available for processing the story. In general, stories with positive emotions were seen as more real than stories with negative emotions. The results are discussed in the context of everyday judgments about emotion, and suggestions are made about when incongruent emotions may seem real."

Originally conceptualized by Hochschild (1983), employees experience emotional labor when their organization dictates how they are to feel and express emotions in return for a wage. While the original conceptualization recognized emotional labor could be either oppressive or liberating, it did not theorize emotional labor as having simultaneous oppressive and liberating qualities. This study investigates the management strategies and consequences of emotional labor in a hotel by utilizing a qualitative interview method that solicited recalled conversational episodes. Results show that management strategies were reflective of controlled employees who generally managed challenging episodes through suppression of true or felt emotions. This control benefited the organization and harmed the employee. Implications for future emotional labor research and limitations of the present study are detailed."
2005-0512,Emotion and Sports: Measuring Emotional Valence via Self-Report and Facial EMG,Physiological Methods and the Media: A High Density Panel,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,Emotion and Sports: Measuring Emotional Valence via Self-Report and Facial EMG,Physiological Methods and the Media: A High Density Panel,This study examines valence in emotional responses to positive and negative gendered portrayals during televised sports. Also examined in this study is the subject's valence after viewing athletes that cross gender lines and participate in sports not believed appropriate for their gender. Valence is measured in two ways: physiologically via facial electromyography and self-report via the Self Assessment Manikin. It is predicted that male subjects will have increased zygomatic activity while watching male athletes and increased corrugator activity while watching female athletes. The opposite is predicted for female subjects.

In particular, the use of the locution I love you was investigated. Results indicate that the use of the locution I love you fluctuates greatly across cultures: It is used exclusively for romantic declarations of love in some cultures, but has a much wider distribution in others. Interestingly, nonnative speakers seem to use the locution I love you more in English than their native language. Differences are also noticeable within cultures, particularly across genders and age groups. Thus, females tend to use the expression more often than males, which confirms research findings by Ting-Toomey (1991). In addition, there seems to be more widespread use of the locution now than just a few decades ago."

Current surge of the interests in the topic of empathy goes with the diffusing conflicts across race, gender, class and culture. The recent interests in empathy are also linked with the failure of the modern Enlightenment project to resolve the dilemmas of the human condition through reason. This paper complicates the issue of empathy by raising the question about the possible link between compassion and action. Critically dealing with various issues involving the link such as the centrality of pain in the discussion of compassion, the politics of suffering, and the locus of the body in pain in the realm of action, this paper engages the issue of empathy and compassion as a hermeneutical problem."

Data from twelve focus group interviews and 571 surveys reveal common themes regarding employee perceptions of third party intervention by management and human resources staff. Findings suggest that even when organizational members are familiar with effective conflict management options, use of third party intervention is complicated by hierarchical power structures that result in suspicion of management and fear of retaliation. Study participants indicate that conflict management systems would gain credibility if third parties were believed to be conflict management experts, neutral and unbiased, and independent from management. These recommendations describe the characteristics of an ombuds office and point toward the potential effectiveness of the ombuds model for improving employee confidence in organizational conflict management systems."
2005-0516,Enacting Cultural Diversity Through Multicultural Radio in Australia,Fostering Dialogue and Democracy Through Communication Policy,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,Enacting Cultural Diversity Through Multicultural Radio in Australia,Fostering Dialogue and Democracy Through Communication Policy,"Australia is second only to Israel in being the worlds most culturally diverse nation, based largely on high levels of immigration in the second part of the 20th century.

From the 1970s Australia formally recognised the massive social changes brought about by postwar immigration, and provided legislation to incorporate cultural diversity into everyday lives. One such legislative enactment saw the establishment of multicultural broadcasting in Australia, as arguably a world-first, both in its comprehensiveness and diversity.

Today Australia has a public sector corporation, the Special Broadcasting Service, administering five radio services in 68 languages. As well, the Community Radio sector produces multicultural programming in 100 languages through a number of its 330 broadcast and 207 narrowcast stations.

This paper examines the relationship between radio and its communities. It argues that despite the profile of SBS television, radio is much closer to its constituent communities, and thereby plays a greater role in enabling those communities to speak their own histories, beyond the confines of a consensual Anglophile paradigm."

It was hypothesized that guilt has a curvilinear effect on attitude change and message reference may have an effect on the perception of guilt, that is, self-reference may lead to higher guilt feeling for American people (the representative for individualistic cultures), whereas other-reference may lead to higher guilt feeling for Chinese people (the representative for collectivistic cultures). A 2 (self-reference vs. other-reference) X 3 (low, moderate, and high guilt induction) X 2 (individualistic vs. collectivistic culture) factorial designed was used. The results were consistent with the predictions that 1) low and moderate guilt appeals generated more positive relevant thoughts and more positive attitudes in both cultures than the high guilt appeal messages did; and 2) the self-referenced moderate guilt induction generated more behaviour intention for American people, and the other-referenced moderate guilt induction generated more behaviour intention in Chinese people then other types of messages. Results were discussed and implication for persuasive health message design was provided."
2005-0518,"Engendering the Nation: Women, Bodies and Identity on Italian Television",Women in International TV,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,"Engendering the Nation: Women, Bodies and Identity on Italian Television",Women in International TV,"This paper will focus mostly on the fabrication of the Italian woman enacted by mainstream television. The conception of woman will here be circumscribed by a focus on the body, discourse, and ethnicity as cardinal accouterments of the national identity promoted by television. The female body is an essential element of feminine identity and is approached as such by television producers, writers, and consumers alike. The ubiquitous and insistent consideration given to the physicality of women is inscribed in a particular kind of discourse, whereby explicit linguistic choices and more subtle visual codes converge to reify the female body along well-known ideological axes. In this light, the introduction of ethnicity as a recent variable in the images of female Italianness proves a destabilizing force, contributed by globalization, and a necessary dimension in the investigation of national television at the turn of the century."
2005-0519,Entertainment Television and its Interactions with Individual Values in Explaining Political Participation,Top Student Papers in Political Communication,Political Communication,,,Paper,Entertainment Television and its Interactions with Individual Values in Explaining Political Participation,Top Student Papers in Political Communication,This manuscript highlights the potential of considering the interaction between media use and human values in discussions about traditional political participation. A model is presented that suggests entertainment television exposure is associated with decreased participation for most value-types but that this impact is greatest for those highest in the progressive values of self-transcendence and openness to change (Schwartz 1992). These relationships provide context to Putnams (2000) argument that entertainment television use is driving down participation in Western countries. Data for 11 European Union countries in the European Social Survey were used in the analyses.

To do so, we review past literature on workplace incivility and link it to workplace bullying. Because workplace bullying is an understudied, largely invisible issue in the communication literature, we then introduce its central characteristics and distinguish it from incivility. Next we explicate our belief that bullying is a communicative issue by highlighting the communication aspects of the most commonly used workplace bullying measurement instrument and by providing a brief analysis of survey data that indicate how communication is used both to perpetrate and respond to bullying. Finally, we argue that communication scholars are uniquely poised to contribute to the understanding and management of workplace bullying."

Corporate culture is one of the important factors affecting the success of mergers and the development of a diverse medium group that would be taken into account by investors. The aim of this research is to draw a guide of Taiwanese media corporate culture and investigate a set of media cultural measurements. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to establish the media cultural model. Top management teams, managerial and bottom staff of media were surveyed and interviewed. The results show there are 55 variables and six orientations comprised of the media corporate cultural model, i.e. leadership and management, institution and rule, value and belief, company symbol, working climate and rite and ritual. The research suggests that industrial characteristics and national cultures affect media corporate cultures, measurements of media model are different from those of general business corporate cultures."

This paper will try to demonstrate that the entire argument seems to be nothing more than a debate between how it should be and what it is. Although the idea of a universal code of ethics may be attractive, in practice it seems to be impossible, irrelevant, and even dangerous. The main problem is that freedom, fairness, democracy, respect for human life are not values themselves but simply labels representing different things for different nations. Consequently, when the universalists proclaim the universality of values, indeed, they proclaim nothing more than some relative universality of labels. That is, what they argue for can be called ethical labelism. The main idea of this paper is that ethical labelism is superficial conceptually and disastrous in practice."

The study identified significant differences in polarization of opinions and attitudes regarding health and breast cancer between White and African-American women. The responses from a survey of 404 women were evaluated for the degree of polarization of women's opinions and attitudes towards breast cancer dimensions related to self determination, spirituality and fate, the effect of the degree of polarization on the attention they pay to breast cancer related media messages and the influence of income and education on polarization and attention to media messages."
2005-0524,Euclidean Distance as a Theory of Perceived Reality,"Reality, Virtual Reality, and Space",Information Systems,,,Paper,Euclidean Distance as a Theory of Perceived Reality,"Reality, Virtual Reality, and Space","Recent research has illuminated many aspects of perceived reality  in particular the perceived reality of media stories. We know that an event's typicality plays a large role in its perceived reality (Shapiro & Chock, 2003), that people can quickly assess the perceived reality of even unfamiliar stories (Bradley & Shapiro, 2004), that recognition sensitivity is greater for atypical items, and that recognition decisions are made more conservatively for atypical items (Shapiro & Fox, 2002). Shapiro and colleagues have offered a general account of perceived reality, but the literature has not addressed how these phenomena occur in the brain. This paper proposes a model of perceived reality based upon an attractor-based neural network that conceives of thoughts as patterns of activation across a large group of neurons. In this model, thoughts and memories are points in a multi-dimensional state space. By manipulating typicality as the relative density of thoughts within this space and measuring the Euclidean distance between stored memories and media scenarios, this model is able to parsimoniously account for the pattern of results outlined above. The model is fitted to human data, which illustrates that distance in memory space is a heuristic way to theorize about perceived reality."
2005-0525,European and National Campaign Coverage in a Long-Term Perspective,Politics Over Space and Time,Political Communication,,,Paper,European and National Campaign Coverage in a Long-Term Perspective,Politics Over Space and Time,"In recent years, the European Union (EU) has become more and more important for the lives of Europeans due to its growing authorities in policy-making. In contrast to that, there still are several shortcomings in our knowledge of the presentation of European institutions, political processes and events in the media. This paper focuses on the coverage of the elections to the European Parliament (EP) because of two contradictory developments: Although the relevance of the EP for EU decision-making has considerably increased since 1979, voter interest and voting turnout at EP elections has been declining. Against this backdrop the paper (a) investigates the long-term development of the coverage of EP elections in the German press and (b) compares EP and national election campaign coverage. The analysis shows that there has not been an increase of EP election coverage; that EP elections were covered much less frequently than national elections; that like in national elections there was a trend towards more subjectivity in EP election coverage; that EP elections were looked at from a mainly national perspective and that the degree of personalization was lower in EP than in national election coverage. In addition, explicit assessments of the political relevance of the EP gave a better picture of the real development than one would expect from the analysis of the mere amount of coverage."

The Debate About the European Public Sphere: a Meta-Analysis of Media Content Analyses,"Media, Memory, and Identity","The existence of a European public sphere is disputed  not only in communication and media science. A common thesis in research is that a European public sphere can be constituted via the Europeanization of reporting in the national media. On the basis of a qualitatively oriented meta-analysis, this contribution aims to answer the question of whether such Europeanization is taking place in the European countries. With reference to 17 studies analysing media contents from several European countries, the empirical research in the German, English and French language since the beginning of the 1990s is systematically evaluated. All of the examined studies pursue an approach which compares with one another the media reporting of European topics in different European countries. The meta-analysis shows that in the 15 member states of the European Union prior to the enlargement of 2004 developmental tendencies of differing markedness up to a Europeanization of the national public spheres are discernible. Overall, however, EU topics account for only a small part of total reporting in all of the countries. Compared to national protagonists, the leading figures at the EU level also play a subordinate role. Discussion includes both national differences and the significance of the reported events."

Undergraduate students (N = 542) at a large eastern university completed survey asking them to evaluate a recent supportive interaction with another individual in which the student received advice. The advice content (i.e., usefulness, facilitation of coping, and absence of limitation) was evaluated in addition to several components of the advice source and advice interaction including perceived regard for face, receptiveness, message quality, and advice outcome (i.e., facilitation of coping, sufficiency of support, and intention to implement). Results indicate a similar pattern of results reported by MacGeorge et al. with several important concerns uncovered in the data. First, data from both the current study and a follow-up study (N = 64) suggest measurement concerns with MacGeorge et al.s measure of sufficiency of support. Measurement concerns were also evident in the measure(s) of regard for face. Results are discussed and several concerns are articulated about using self-report study designs and possibility of rater bias. A call was also sounded for more replication studies in human communication research."

The findings suggest that intercultural training for China Program at CSB/SJU is not very comprehensive, yet it is fairly satisfactory and effective. It does affect the students performance in many positive ways. Furthermore, it reduces the degree of culture shock and makes the program going more smoothly. Students who took part in the training attentively and actively found that they adjusted to the new culture fast and well. Also, those who are open-minded, tolerant and patient benefit magnificently in terms of character building, world-view enhancing, and culture diversity alerting."

Clear patterns emerged in the cases that garnered the most newspaper attention: the victim was likely to be a young female from a middle-upper class neighborhood who was abducted from her home by a male, low-class stranger. This portrayal is counter to real crime statistics, which show that such abductions are the rarest type. The types of abductions that recieved the most newspaper coverage reinforce societal myths about female vulnerability and male deviance."

But impressions may be more complex than merely basing them on character role categories. The present study attempted to examine the relationship between impression traits as applied to media villains and their relationship to resulting emotional responses. According to the results, while the impressions formed across various types of villains are similar, the emotional responses vary suggesting the use of motivation and situational context."

In the current paper, we define what virtual experience is based on the types of objects being experienced and the ways of experiencing. Then, we review three lines of research traditions examining the evolutionary nature of human responses to virtual experiencea) studies on Media Equation (ME) which investigate human responses to physical and/or social features of virtual objects; b) studies on Doubly Disembodied Language (DDL) which examine human responses to synthesized speech; and c) studies on human preferences for specific content types in media. Based on the general review of the three research traditions, we propose that peoples natural and social responses to virtual objects and contents come from the cognitive hijacking of the general thinking mechanism by specialized mind modules."

I begin with an overview of restorative justice, which serves as the theoretical framework for VOMD programs. I show that restorative justice is fundamentally communication oriented. This paper uses empirical evidence from VOMD cases to assess the extent to which genuine dialogue is possible in these mediation sessions. Riikonen (1999) points out several essential ingredients in sustainable dialogue. Essentials qualities of dialogue that promote sustainable dialoguethe kind of dialogue that can truly be considered genuineinclude self-interest or a personal craving for inspiring experiences, the potential for the unexpected to foster freshness and interest in the dialogue, and finally a safe enough context for interaction. Each one of these pointsself-interest, the unexpected, and safetyis present in the VOMD dialogue sessions. Additional data is used to offer a fourth characterisitc of genuine dialogue: time."

Given that these media convey unequivocal messages about sexuality but contradicting and implicit messages about physical appearance, this paper explores the relationships between exposure to lad media (magazines or television shows) and body self-consciousness (measured as trait self-objectification and body surveillance). A two-year panel study involving 226 undergraduates is presented. Measures of exposure to lad magazines and lad television, trait self-objectification, and body surveillance were taken at the outset of the study. One year later, trait self-objectification and body surveillance were measured again. For men, exposure to lad magazines predicted a subsequent increase in body surveillance, while exposure to lad television predicted a subsequent increase in both body surveillance and trait self-objectification. In contrast, female participants were largely unaffected by exposure to lad media. Discussion focuses on the contradicting and multi-layered portrayals of appearance and sexuality contained in lad media."

Rumination at the beginning of the study was associated negatively with self-esteem and positively with perceptions that the secret was relevant to ones identity and concerns about managing ones impression on the target. High rumination, in turn, predicted revelation of ones secret. Among individuals who revealed their secret, the extent to which rumination declined was inversely related to the perceived negativity of the targets response, and increases in self-esteem were associated with the extent to which revealers viewed the secret as less relevant to their identity over time."

The current study used an experimental design to test exemplification of public opinion as a theoretical explanation for the hostile media effect. Exemplification of public opinion (as manipulated by the ratio of supportive to unsupportive quotes in the article) was found to affect article bias perceptions among all participants, but especially among members of a partisan group. Perceptions of story bias mediated the relationship between exemplification of public opinion and perceptions of how influential the story would be in changing others opinions about the partisan group."

Recent whistle-blowing research has been quite informative, though maintaining a narrow perspective on this activity. The purpose of this paper is to broaden whistle-blowing research by generating theoretically-driven propositions from three distinct perspectives, each of which could inform whistle-blowing scholarship. These perspectives include stakeholder theory, organizational change-related theories, and that of the structure of the organization. It is hoped that this essay generates new research into this distinct communicative event."
2005-0554,Explicating Threats: Towards a Conceptual Understanding of the Faces and Fabric of Threat in an Organizational Crisis,Contingent Factors To Influence Public Relations,Public Relations,,,Paper,Explicating Threats: Towards a Conceptual Understanding of the Faces and Fabric of Threat in an Organizational Crisis,Contingent Factors To Influence Public Relations,"Threat has been commonly used to describe the state of seizure a nation, organization, or individual, is in during a crisis. Even though it is such a heavily used word, the concept of threat has not been fully explicated, particularly in public relations literature. Yet, threat, which is often used interchangeably with risk, fear, and conflict, is both the cause, and the effect, of crisis. This conceptual paper proposes the explication of the concept by expanding, cross-fertilizing, and integrating ideas from an inter-disciplinary review of literature. The dimensionality of threats in a crisis is enumerated, and a threat appraisal model, with a series of propositions, based on the cognitive, affective, and conative levels, is offered to test the effects of threats. The authors believe that a clearer conceptual understanding of the faces and fabric of threat in crisis have enormous implications for theory development in public relations, in particular, in the understanding and diagnosing of threats in crisis, which, in turn, affects how crisis can be communicated, managed, and survived by organizations."

It was hypothesized that jealousy, sociosexuality, and vengefulness would be positively related to approval of communicative infidelity across a variety of scenarios. A survey of 386 college students revealed over a third (37%) indicated they had engaged in infidelity. Acceptability and justifiability ratings of communicative infidelity in various scenarios demonstrated complex factor structures. Results revealed that jealousy showed significant but small relationships to approval of communicative infidelity. Sociosexuality and vengefulness revealed significant more moderate-sized relationships in the expected direction. Males and females differed in their approval of communicative infidelity as expected, but the effect sizes ranged from 2 to 10% of the variance. Discussion considers the potential role of communicative infidelity in resolving some discrepancies in the infidelity literature and theory."

This study applied Uses and Gratifications theory and prior research of gender communication and information seeking to learn about audience's activity in two Internet Cancer Support Groups (ICSGs). A content analysis of 1,424 Email messages posted to the two ICSGs revealed similarities in the content of communication in the two virtual communities examined, gender differences in participation, and differences in utilization of these communities between patients compared to family members of patients. These results are discussed in view of the diverse uses of ICSGs that they reveal, the role of family members in support seeking and provision, and gender communication styles in health Computer Mediated Communication."

As a subscription medium, satellite radio diffusion remains stagnant. To compete effectively against their terrestrial and online counterparts, the satellite radio industry needs to understand their potential audiences listening needs and wants. As little is known on who and what these audiences are, this study intends to explore the potential cognitive, behavioral and demographic factors associated with satellite radio adoption. In particular, it surveyed a national sample to examine audience affinity, motives and activity as well as format preferences to help assess listener interest in adopting satellite radio. Study findings suggest that the exploratory theoretical framework tested in this study-- including the uses and gratification perspective, the audience activity construct and the technology cluster concept--were able to explain satellite radio adoption interest with strong empirical support."
2005-0558,Exploring the Dimensions of Cancer-Related Information Seeking and Scanning Behavior,formation Seeking and Uncertainty Management,Health Communication,,,Paper,Exploring the Dimensions of Cancer-Related Information Seeking and Scanning Behavior,Information Seeking and Uncertainty Management,"The literature about cancer-related information focuses on information seeking, characterized as a purposeful search to answer a question about a specific or broader topic. We suspected that a great deal of engagement with cancer-relevant information happens less purposively (we call it scanning). This paper presents results from an in-depth interview study to explore seeking and scanning behavior (SSB) in the context of cancer-related lifestyle and screening decisions among a diverse sample of people living in a major metropolitan area. Results suggest that scanning is quite common, particularly for information related to screening tests. Active information seeking is much rarer and occurs primarily among those who also are scanners. Individuals are only moderately consistent in their position on SSB across cancers (breast/prostate/colon) and decisions (lifestyle/screening). Respondents report using a greater variety of sources for scanning than for seeking, but participants were much more likely to report that their decisions were influenced by information received through seeking than scanning. Mass media sources (television, radio, newspapers) were very frequently used for scanning, but virtually never used for seeking. In contrast, doctors or other members of the medical establishment were the most common source of cancer-related information seeking, followed by non-professional interpersonal sources (family, friends and co-workers), the internet, and books. Findings shed new light on how individuals navigate the media environment in the context of the new emphasis on patients as active consumers of health care and suggest future research should examine predictors and effects of less purposeful efforts to obtain cancer-related information."

Baxter and Montgomerys relational dialectics encompasses four tenets: contradictions, change, praxis, and totality. These four tenets intertwined in explaining the dynamics in relationships. Qualitative interviews were conducted from 20 multinational companies in China. Findings show that relationships are not static. Organizations, serving their own interest, as well as their publics, usually face contradictions in relationships; therefore, the nature of a relationship changes."

Surveys (N = 711) were administered in South Korea and India and the data were subjected to structural equation modeling. The Korean data revealed that U.S. television viewing was positively associated with estimates of U.S. peoples affluence, and those affluence estimates were negatively associated with satisfaction with Korean society. The Indian data revealed that U.S. television viewing was positively associated with materialism, though only among people who have no or few friends and relatives in the U.S., and materialism was negatively associated with satisfaction with Indian society. Implications of findings in terms of international cultivation research are discussed."

However, it remains one of the least explored and understood forces in media research. Using survey data of the Pew Internet and American Life Project and multivariate analysis, study explores whether religious activity is affected by Internet usage on the part of the user, if Internet usage is affected by the religiosity of the user, and if religious affiliation has an effect on Internet usage. The results suggest that Religiosity seems to be a stronger predictor of going online than religious activity and that non-Catholics are more likely to use the Internet than Catholics."

Regret, in particular, has been wholly overlooked in the realm of media study. This research explores how regretted past experiences impact interest in experience-relevant television programming as well as the effect of such programming on felt regret and enjoyment. 144 participants, half of whom had been unfaithful in a romantic relationship, were asked to rate a series of storylines for interest in viewing. They were then exposed to one of two versions of a TV program segment edited to have different endings  regret for cheating or rationalization. Consistent with hypotheses, those who had both cheated and felt regret about their behavior were more likely than others to show interest in viewing cheating-related programming. Further, they appeared to enjoy the cheating storyline more than others, particularly the version with the dissonance-reducing ending. Overall, regret appeared to have been reduced, though this was not contingent on which ending had been viewed. We conclude that television can be a sought after and effective source for coping with regret."

The concept of creative industries was taken up by UNCTAD in 2004 as an alternative agenda to UNESCOs focus on cultural diversity. It is also recognition of the value of the global cultural economy as intangible services and intellectual property rents increasingly contribute to nations GDP. Creative industries embrace both traditional and contemporary culture, but exportable industries are primarily content-driven. This focus on export content shifts the development argument away from the provision of infrastructure towards innovation in the global economy. I focus here on the synergy between financial and creative inputs into production, distribution, and marketing of film and television. I also make some concluding observations about convergence across industry sectors and the prospects for digital content industries."

A survey of junior and senior undergraduates indicated that prospective employees value employed friends as their primary source of workplace information, but that communication with parents was more strongly related to their initial psychological contract. Emotional support from parents and friends was positively correlated with the prospective employees optimism toward the workplace, but discussing job insecurity, layoffs, and the poor state of the economy with friends was negatively associated with optimism. Prospective employees expectations for job security increased with emotional support from and positive feelings derived from interactions with parents, but not friends. Expectations for organizational support were positively associated with emotional support from and positive feelings stemming from interactions with both parents and friends. Expectations for organizational support, job security, and organizational trust were not significantly related to discussion of negative workplace trends with parents or friends. Positive feelings about the workplace based on interactions with parents and friends predicted organizational trust, but the nature of the psychological contract was the primary predictor of trust. Surprisingly, results demonstrated that prospective employees initial psychological contracts and organizational trust are relatively resilient against their awareness of downsizing and job insecurity, and that emotional support and positive feelings are vital to creating optimistic expectations for the workplace."
2005-0565,Expressing Emotions Online: An Analysis of Visual Aspects of Emoticons,Visual Studies Interactive Paper Session,Visual Studies,,,Paper,Expressing Emotions Online: An Analysis of Visual Aspects of Emoticons,Visual Studies Interactive Paper Session,"This paper presents a research on emoticons, visual representations of facial expressions used in computer-mediated communication as a substitute for nonverbal cues. The concept of critical visual methodology and a theoretical framework of visual semiotics were used to examine the way in which facial expressions and emotions were coded and visually represented, analyzing the design features of emoticons such as shape, color, and context.

The analysis has shown that emoticons represented human face in a highly abstract way  as genderless, raceless, and ageless circular graphs - to display seven types of emotions, known as basic emotions. These are: happy, sad, shocked, disappointed, anxious, positive, and in love. Each type of emoticons required a different combination of textual and contextual devices to create a meaning. The easiest to code were happiness, sadness, and a state of shock, while representations of anxiousness and disappointment required a highly contextualized background and textual clarifications. All of the analyzed emoticons demonstrated the challenge to visually code communicative richness of the human face.

The interpretation of these findings addressed the analyzed emoticons with regard to the complexity of the human face as found in anthropology and psychobiology. The interpretation suggests that the creators of emoticons must rely on logical signs instead of drawing on the expressive signs that represent emotion in humans. As a result, emoticons hold a very limited ability to function as a substitute for nonverbal cues, and show a heavy reliance on context, metaphor, and visual language of the contemporary Western society."

In order to extend the purview of the theory, this central hypothesis was tested in the context of HIV/AIDS prevention behaviors. Data (N = 890) were collected from eight districts in Malawi in southern Africa as part of a baseline research effort to obtain benchmark measures on key behavior change indicators. Results pertaining to two behaviors, use of condoms and remaining monogamous, are reported in this study. Relationships between risk perception and behavioral intentions were not significant, but those between efficacy beliefs and behavioral intentions were. Furthermore, efficacy beliefs were found to moderate the relationship between risk perception and intentions to remain monogamous, but not between risk perceptions and intentions to use condoms. The model was able to explain approximately 40 percent of the variance in intentions to use condoms, and 19 percent of the variance in intentions to remain monogamous. Implications for health campaigns, particularly the need to strengthen efficacy beliefs and the need to be careful in enhancing risk perceptions without simultaneously strengthening efficacy beliefs, are also discussed."

Characters, Personality, and Relationships",Information Systems,,,Paper,Extraversion and Entertainment: An Experimental Study on the Influence of Personality on Information Processing and Entertainment,"What's Entertaining? Characters, Personality, and Relationships","Beyond explaining differences in media preferences, information processing, and media effects by socio-demographic variables, personality psychology provides for finding explanations by incorporating so-called psychographic variables. One prominent way of describing differences in personality is by measuring a persons personality type. Extraversion, as one personality type, distinguishes between individuals more or less in need of external stimulation. According to Eysenck, this difference is biologically based and influences behavior. Media offers are an easily accessible way of meeting this need for external stimulation. The study examines differences in information processing of television offers due to a persons personality type being extravert or introvert. A more or less optimal media offer should result in a satisfaction of the need for external stimulation, and thus in a better entertainment experience. Entertainment is described according to the triadic-dynamic entertainment theory as a positive emotion on a macro-level evolving when a recipient experiences a feeling of control during the reception process."

For half of the subjects, the photograph of the candidate was morphed such that the image presented was a blend composed of 60% of the unfamiliar Caucasian male and 40% of the subject. For the other half the photograph was unaltered. Given previous research on implicit familiarity (Zajonc, 1968, 1980), we predicted that the morph would advantage the candidate. The results demonstrated no main effect of the similarity manipulation. However, there was a robust similarity by gender interaction. Male subjects evaluated the morphed candidate more favorably than the unaltered photograph, while female subjects rated him more negatively. We discuss potential explanations for this interaction effect, and explore the political implications of facial similarity as a political cue, especially in low-information elections."

In the case of terminal illness, many patients exercise their right to refuse treatment, particularly when treatment and the application of life-sustaining procedures would merely postpone death. While there has been much debate about refusing treatment, the value of care options, and ending life, little research has been done on how decisions are made, and even less have been evaluated empirically. The literature reviewed here regards both end-of-life care options (which include advanced directives, naming proxies, and subscribing to hospice care) and ending life care options (which include the refusal of basic medical treatment, rational suicide, and physician assisted suicide). Matters regarding decision-making within these life care choices will emerge and be discussed. In addition to detailing how these matters affect the decision-making process, this paper will tend to this neglected topic by addressing it through the theoretical framework of the social exchange model. While social exchange theory is not necessarily a decision-making model, it raises issues that clearly impact the decision-making process and relationships patients may have with caregivers, family, and medical personnel. Just how these and other factors may influence the decision-making process are of interest, and should direct future research regarding end of life care options and decision-making."

By taking the Internet self-efficacy scale (Eastin & LaRose, 2000) as an example, the author found that the Internet self-efficacy difference between men and women was likely to result from the psychometric properties of the scale itself rather than from gender. Therefore, caution is warranted when using this instrument for gender comparisons, as many items appear to contain construct irrelevant variance that may serve as an impediment to evaluating differences between males and females. Moreover, such a psychometric issue merits more attention in the communication discipline because communication researchers seldom censor scales before applying them into the context of group comparisons. In addition, besides using rating scales, communication researchers may also need to consider uses of other alternative measuring methods such as Graded Response Model. The author further suggested that a reference to more advanced psychometric methodologies such as item response theory and classical test theory might enhance measurement and evaluation of new technology users."

A survey of public relations and/or public affairs managers from Taiwans top-500 companies was conducted. The results showed that the relative effects of three factors on four relational characteristics are in the order of form of crisis response (timely response, consistent response, and active response), then crisis communicative strategies (denial, diversion, excuse, justification and concession), and last organizational reputation. Moreover, the results challenge the traditional wisdom involving the robustness of concession as an effective communicative strategy across crisis situations. Specifically, the results emphasized the intriguing mediating role of form of crisis response by demonstrating that it is necessary for more concession communicative response to generate more favorable relational outcomes."

The study was conducted in Chennai, a large city in India. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from a total of 343 CSWs. In summary, the findings supported the model proposed by this study to determine the various factors that influence the condom use behavior of women CSWs in Chennai, India. This study has proposed a model that combined concepts from various theoretical perspectives and models. Within the context of this studys model, various cognitive, social, psychological and behavioral factors including perceived vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, social support, outcome expectancies and peer group comparison, were related to condom use self-efficacy. Condom use self-efficacy was in turn related to the use of condoms. The results of the study have important implications for the creation of broad conceptually based interventions to promote AIDS prevention behavior in populations at risk. Several recommendations for targeted interventions are offered to promote AIDS prevention behavior among CSWs."

As antismoking information from the media and discussion about smoking with parents can both cast influence on childrens perceptions and behaviors about smoking, this study aimed to explore the relationships of these two sources of influence and their outcome variables. Mediation and moderation models were tested to provide theoretical implications of how mass media and interpersonal communication may interplay in health communication, as well as to offer practical insights for potentially involving parents in mediated antismoking campaigns."

We argue that such appropriations of corporate techniques, language, and thinking not only obscure healthy distinctions between home and work but also integrate work values, patterns, and perspectives into everyday constructions of family life so thoroughly as to bring into question what a family is and what values, practices, and relationships make family life different from the corporate world. Drawing on feminist theories of care, we critique three examples of the insinuation of corporate logics and language into popular prescriptions about family practices and we counter these prescriptions with feminist-inspired ""re-visions"" of family life."

The show, a one-hour television drama about the fictional presidency of Democrat Josiah Bartlet, has attracted some scholarly attention, in the form of rhetorical analyses, interpretive essays, and an individual-level effects study. Despite the shows sustained popularity and the vibrant existence of fan web sites, no research, however, has documented how fans use or make meaning of the show in their everyday lives. This study does so. Specifically, through a textual analysis of a popular fan web site and in-depth interviews with four fans, this study explores how fans incorporate The West Wing in their daily lives. I conclude that fans are involved with the show and that they use the show in rich and meaningful ways that help to facilitate their understandings, interpretations, and expectations of contemporary politics. Civic and political participation in America may be dreadful, but these fans turn to a televised political world that offers them a more inviting vision of politics and possibility."

Particularly, the study will compare the responses to humor appeal messages and the responses to fear apppeal messages. College students identified as either high risk takers or low risk takers will view both fear and humor anti-drinking television messages. Their heart rate (index of attention), SCRs (index of physiological arousal) and facial EMG (index of valence/emotion) will be measured. Further, this study will examine whether using either fear appeal or humor appeal likely leads to desired changes in the viewers perception and or attitudes toward heavy drinking."

A path model was developed for each ad. Both versions of ad elicited both positive and negative emotions, where positive emotions increased negative emotions. Both emotions produced higher attitude toward the ad. Further, positive emotions from both ads increased attitude change toward drinking. Most importantly, negative emotions elicited from the ad with verbal appeal significantly decreased participants drinking intention. Important implications about the role played by emotions in anti-drinking advertisements are discussed."

Local Television News Framing of a Campus Rape Scandal",The Body as Commodity,"In late 2002, the vice president at a private Catholic college in the western U.S. resigned in compliance with the final demand of campus protests sparked by a series of local television news reports. The stories described a pattern whereby female assault victims left the college to avoid contact with male perpetrators whose expulsions had been overturned by the vice president, in violation of campus disciplinary policy. The framing of these stories differs markedly from the central finding established most often by feminist research on news about sexual assault: that journalistic constraints and values interact with patriarchal assumptions held by journalists to produce news coverage that perpetuates rape myths, including the suggestion that women provoke rape through their dress or behavior. Drawing on a framing analysis of the stories and a semi-structured interview with the key journalist, I argue that largely feminist framing emerges from areas of overlap in the priorities of investigative news and the feminist values of the series producer."

Several of these myths are as follows: that women have equal access to resources in the status quo; that women are inherently feminine; that women are accepting - and enjoying - of attacks on their body; that heterosexuality is the only option for a healthy female. Much of the popularized music in todays society contributes to these myths; however, feminist music enables women to be able to embrace their own self-made identity as opposed to that which culture defines for them.
Music has turned into a political platform for many feminists. Feminist music is an easy way to access all audiences, especially those who would not normally be introduced to feminist thought. Although this type of music, or at least the artists that are analyzed in this paper, may not have popular radio play, the controversy that has been sparked by their lyrics brings the message that they produce into mainstream society. Feminist music is not simply putting the word out about feminism, but is also redefining what people traditionally associate with feminism. The paper will evaluate feminist music in terms of feminist theory, in juxtaposition with current mainstream music that objectifies women."

The design of this study is a pre-test post-test control group and 2 X 3 (advocates perspective X message style) between-subjects factorial design. Participants watched an accurate and empathetic movie portrayal of schizophrenia for 100 minutes, followed by 4 minute value added component (VAC). Participants (N = 165) were randomly assigned to one of the eight conditions (six manipulated conditions plus control group, and another comparison group who watched a VAC trailer prior to the movie). The results showed that viewing an accurate and empathetic movie portrayal of schizophrenia significantly contributed to knowledge acquisition. With respect to the efficiency of educational trailer, VAC added to the movie portrayal not only significantly increased knowledge acquisition but positively influenced audiences stigma reduction. Results of path analyses indicated that entertainment value and educational value of the movie mediated participants stigma reduction (attitude change). Implications of the current study to the mental health research on stigma-reduction strategy and the design of Entertainment-Education contents are discussed."

Gay and lesbian groups have been trying to cooperate with mass media to raise awareness of issues affecting homosexuals and to stimulate gay-straight communication. THA (The Tongzhi Hotline Association) is the gay/lesbian movement group in this case study, and the group has been managing to attract media coverage of gay and lesbian movement events. In the case of militarys ban on gays (May 1, 2002), THA had expected much in media coverage. The case shows they believed that concerns of gays and lesbians were topics of interest to the mainstream media, and so they devoted maximum resources to media outreach. For news coverage and public attention, movement organizers have to be more aware of the function of mainstream media to shape a powerful message and of the necessity for a movement to launch significant events to forward their message."

Men value money more highly and are more obsessive about it than women are. Men and women also display different patterns of communication, with women engaging in higher levels of self-disclosure. We examined these issues in the context of young college students communicating with their parents about their financial situation. We predicted that male and female college students would express different attitudes about money and communicate differently about money with their parents. We also expected that financial attitudes would influence family communication.

It is important, however, to also understand African media organizations as economic institutions and to see how they have developed in that context. This paper offers a different way of looking at media systems in developing countries by describing the development of television broadcasting structures in Ghana from an economic perspective. Evolutionary theory and media system dependency theory are applied to explain how the shape of the broadcasting system in Ghana has been influenced by relationships with the state, the corporate world, and media systems in other countries."

These attributes were: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability, perceived risk, and perceived resources. A total of 381 undergraduate students were asked to rate 70 perceptual statements from strongly agree to strongly disagree with regard to communication technologies. The final factor analysis yielded seven multi-item factors reflecting the seven innovation attributes. Scale reliabilities ranged from high to moderate: complexity (α = .90), perceived resources (α = .85), compatibility (α = .77),
observability (α = .70), relative advantage (α = .69), trialability (α = .66), and perceived risk (α = .59). In addition, five of the scales significantly correlated with an adoption index of 20 communication technologies, indicating an adequate level of criterion-related validity. Planning for subsequent research to refine the scales is also discussed in the paper."

Felds theory of focused-choice predicts that the formation of network ties is constrained by contextual factors that function as foci of activities. In this research, we examined how group assignment and location can function as such foci to influence the development of individual social capital in a distributed learning community. Given that networks of different contents may possess different properties, we examined the impact in two different types of networks  task-related instrumental networks and non-task related expressive networks. A longitudinal research design was used to evaluate the evolution of networks over time. Hypotheses were tested using a sample of 32 students enrolled in distributed learning class. The results showed strong support for Felds theory. While serving as foci of activities to organize social interactions, group assignment and geographic separation also function to fragment a community. (149 words)"

Both US and French newspapers covered safety, economics, risks, and labeling issues. US media were also interested in regulation issues, whereas French media were interested both in food quality and regulatory policies to protect health. Even when they shared similar frames, US and French newspapers emphasized different content. Safety was connected with environmental issues in the US, but with consumer issues in France. Labeling was an official and regulatory issue in the US, while French newspapers viewed regulation as international trade relations. Economics was a domestic frame in each data set. Risk was mainly connected to the Starlink episode in the US media, but involved a broad range of topics in the French media, including health and the environmental impact of GM crops."

As it is widely known, this discursive field has gone for longtime through the egemony of the media imperialism paradigm, according to which the imported media (mainly made by tv fiction), as emanation of alien culture(s), represent a serious threath to the integrity and originality of the local cultures of the importing countries. Although the media imperialism has been criticized from different perspectives  hybridization and cultural proximity among the others  the criticism has been effective in order to neutralize the idea of the threath, but it didnt go beyond that. The further step called for by the author involves a radical inversion of the assumption of the threath in its opposite, the resource. Drawing on a wide range of socio-anthopological literature, and re-examining the role of television in the light of the travel theories, the author hypothesizes that the imported media  re-defined as travelling narratives  are likely to provide indirect access to other territories and to the alterity of people living there, and so to improve and enhance mediated cross-cultural encounters."

However, since his discourse is replete with internal inconsistency and external invalidation, his efforts that failed to convince audiences impaired Chinese governments image during the specific period. This critical analysis sketches the image-repair theory, identifies the accusations against the Chinese government or its health ministry, analyzes Zhangs discourse on SARS, and evaluates the effectiveness of his image-repair discourse. This study has found Zhangs image-repair discourse was ineffectual. Based on this finding, this study emphasizes that a rhetors lies or inaccurate information may ruin the internal consistency of his or her discourse, which may also cause the discourses external invalidation. The combination of these two factors may affect the persuasiveness of an image-repair discourse."

This context is one of driving forces for the media framing. With this background in mind, this study examines the ways in which the State of the Union address in upcoming cycle of the 2004 presidential election is framed in the news media.

The study shows that American media covered the State of the Union address focusing on the issue of the war in Iraq and economy. The result also shows that Americans watched the news stories about the State of the Union address framed negatively. Responsibility and conflict frames were the most prominent strategies to cover the issue. Each frame was used differently by news outlets and issues. Methodologically, the study shows that a standard set of content analytic indicators (Semetko & Valkenburg, 2000) developed in European setting can be used to reliably measure the prevalence of common frame in the news in different setting. Practical implications and future research direction are discussed."

A content analysis of press coverage showed that EU enlargement was portrayed as a highly controversial issue with an overall balanced tone of debate. EU enlargement was supported mainly for geo-strategic reasons and rejected mainly for societal and legal concerns. Both risk and opportunity framing played an equally prominent role in the news. An experiment examined the impact of both frames on citizens support for EU integration. Participants in the opportunity frame condition showed significantly higher support for EU integration compared to participants in the risk condition. This framing effect was moderated by political knowledge. Low knowledgeable individuals were more affected by the experimental manipulation and more susceptible to risk framing.

I argue here that one of the causes of feminisms trouble  the same cause underlying its spectacular rise  can be located in its discourse and analyzed within the parameters of framing as theorized by social movement scholars. Specifically, feminist frames over the past four decades have been so narrowly focused on discrete populations that framing theory objectives have not been achieved: broad-based resonance, appropriate attribution of responsibility, and the promotion of identity and solidarity. Consequently, as feminist frames resonated with some but became irrelevant or insulting to others, feminism became endowed with opposing meanings, causing its dilution and distortion as both a concept and a term. Nonetheless, a deliberate return to framing theory can help feminist scholars and activists reconceptualize feminism in a manner that reignites passion, perceived relevance and commitment."

The former FTC chair called misleading weight loss infomercials a plague. This study uses framing theory to analyze the deceptive infomercials prosecuted by the FTC. The Weight Loss is Easy, Breakthrough Weight Loss Method, and Dismissing Proven Weight Loss Methods frames were found. Users presented most Easy frames and experts presented most Breakthrough and Dismiss Proven Methods frames. The findings suggest the FTC should require deceptive infomercial advertisers to distribute to purchasers and publicize on their Web sites government weight loss brochures or Web pages. Also require these advertisers to publicize a new complaint program online and in sponsorship announcements at the beginning and end of their infomercials. Implementing these suggestions should promote the complaint program and accurate weight loss information among consumers most affected by misleading infomercials."
2005-0611,Framing Justice: Using the Concept of Procedural Justice to Advance Political Communication Research,Deliberation: The Power of Talk,Political Communication,,,Paper,Framing Justice: Using the Concept of Procedural Justice to Advance Political Communication Research,Deliberation: The Power of Talk,"Efforts aimed at increasing civic-minded dialogue among the public must equally consider what encourages or discourages political engagement. One promising line of research originating outside of communication examines the role of procedural justice. Procedural justice essentially argues that individuals care about the fairness of decision-making or deliberative procedures. In turn, perceptions of fairness influence a host of outcome variables, including satisfaction with the process, commitment to the organization, and willingness to take voluntary behaviors on the organizations behalf. We believe that the concept of procedural justice holds significant promise for addressing questions in political communication research, particularly those related to public deliberation. In turn, we offer a synthesis of procedural justice research before proposing a framework for linking procedural justice to framing research. While providing much needed attention to a concept largely overlooked in communication, we endeavor to make more explicit the previously implicit communicative aspects of procedural justice."

The content analysis revealed significant differences between the two papers: the military conflict frame was more common for the U.S. war coverage while the responsibility and anti-war protest frames were more common for the Swedish war coverage. Both newspapers offered human interest stories and media self-references. The U.S. newspaper, however, relied more heavily on official government and military sources. In addition, the tone of war coverage differed across the two nations, with Swedish reporting being more negative overall. Implications of the differences in war coverage as well as possible reasons rooted in the national media and political systems are discussed."
2005-0613,Framing the Candidates: The Role of Questions in Political Debates,The Content and Viewing of Televised Debates,Political Communication,,,Paper,Framing the Candidates: The Role of Questions in Political Debates,The Content and Viewing of Televised Debates,"Questions asked by the panelists in political debates should be treated as framing endeavors. The more adversarial the questions, the more they confine the candidates to ranges of presentation controlled by the panelist. A case-study of one debate in the 2004 Democratic primary debates, demonstrates how this type of framing-by-questions takes place. The analysis concludes: (a.) adversarial questioning increased for the more viable candidates; (b.) the viable candidates were most commonly confronted with recurring customized themes in these questions; (c.) they were asked the lowest proportion of issue questions. Whereas unviable candidates were asked to detail their worldview, viability predicted more questions about the candidates personality or campaign strategy. Issue questions addressed at viable candidates were predominantly adverse, restricting the candidates to a narrow set of issues that, in turn, defined the frame of reference through which the candidate could be perceived. These frames of reference were a continuation of pre-existing definitions of the candidate in the political discourse."

One capstone event of this battle is the well-publicized affaire du foulard, the veil affair, of 1989, which threw France into a tailspin of arguments over whether Islam could be compatible with the well entrenched principle of secularism in France.
Some of the fields where this discourse has been visited by researchers are literature, cinema, and recently music. Diasporic radio and television, however, have rarely been visible in the research agenda of international media studies.Thus my focus on Beur FM in Paris is an attempt to recognize the importance of the discourses of diasporic radio because they serve as cues to explore French identity and the articulation of cultural pluralism and difference. The experience of Beur FM and its role within the North African diaspora in this context need to be understood in light of their implication in the ongoing process of redefining both the political and cultural project of what the French nation is. In other words, it is the local that I stress in the transnational reality of diaspora: Beur FM, a telling example of this reality, is a window that reflects the arduous journey toward stretching the French paradigms of identity."

This paper includes a brief history of the Pedro Vicente Maldonado project, including survey results, implementation of the project and up-to-date project status. There is also an in-depth description of the information and communications technologies (ICTs) that can serve as a model for international telemedicine programs. The application of telecommunication and computer technologies specifically for clinical care has been emerging in the field of medicine. An essential component to implementing any international health project is to have an understanding of community attitudes, beliefs, and practices. In order to determine community attitudes, needs, and practices in a reliable and valid manner, a triangulation approach to data collection was applied. Both qualitative data and quantitative data were collected from key stakeholders. The location of this project is a remote Ecuadorian community of 5,000 rural poor individuals, with 60,000 more living within a three-county range. Despite the recent construction of a hospital to serve this region, barriers to accessing high quality care continue and include prohibitive cost to patients, limited competency of local physicians, and a geographic location that is of significant distance from secondary and tertiary urban care facilities, making telemedicine a viable and valuable resources for this community"
2005-0616,From Colony to Nation: Patriotism in Post-Colonial Trinidad and Tobago,Borderless Colonies,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,From Colony to Nation: Patriotism in Post-Colonial Trinidad and Tobago,Borderless Colonies,"August 31st, 2002 marked the 40th Anniversary of Trinidad and Tobagos independence, and was a highly anticipated and celebrated occasion. However, among the preparations was a mega-concert in the capital city, Port-Of-Spain, featuring Usher, an up and coming African American R&B artist, whose music is particularly popular with the youth. To think that it is acceptable in the minds of many to include an obviously American concert as part of the Independence celebrations in Trinidad and Tobago is disheartening. One major question therefore arises: What does it mean to be patriotic in a post-colonial nation that continues to struggle with establishing a national identity? Considering the discourse of colonialism, nationalism and patriotism, this paper will argue that post-colonial nations have a greater task of defining itself in the shadow of the colonizer, and must therefore be wary of those forces of globalization that undermine that process. The processes of globalization and cultural identification can exist simultaneously, and yet the former should not be at the expense of the latter. Using postcolonial theory, this paper will argue that nations that are in the wake of colonialism need to be vigilant with respect to foreign cultural products. It is not that they should work to keep these products out, but that these products should not sacrifice the growth and appreciation of local culture under the guise of progress."

Examining the coverage of AIDS by the Chinese governments most important newspaper revealed the media agenda of AIDS in China and the governments attitude and political agenda towards AIDS. A total of 976 articles published over this nineteen-year period was analyzed using a computer assisted content analysis program (tf.idf) to identify the key words in each article. Key words were then used to identify the framing of each article. The findings demonstrated that increased attention had been paid by Chinese government to AIDS. Meanwhile, 1995, 2001, and 2003 marked the governments AIDS policy change, which was reflected in the coverage of the Peoples Daily. The population groups most associated with AIDS were children and women. Prevention and medical were the main frames for AIDS. Social and political aspects of the pandemic had gained attention in the late 1990s and early years of 2000."

Drawing from black feminist and feminist cultural studies theoretical and methodological approaches to studying popular communication, I analyze Latifahs form (physicality) and function in the films that construct her as the mammy and hot mamatwo controlling images of black womanhood. Depending on her relation(ship) to white female and male bodies, Latifah is the sexual un/desirable. She is a freak. Her characters fall outside white heteronormativity not only because of what the black body is, but also because of what the black body does. In questioning the dialogue of differencerepresented through the oppositional hip-hop bodyI address the processes by which media makers appropriate subcultural icons to signify difference while reinscribing racist notions of blackness, which work to facilitate white hegemony in the popular."

Complicated by history, culture, class, and desire, this gap leads to what Alison Murray calls mutual incomprehension between the two parties. This paper examines and critiques the ways in which some intellectual works have contributed to this mutual incomprehension. To move around and beyond it, I argue, requires theoretical and political attention to the cultural specificity of the indigenous consciousness.
In this regard, I contend, the notion of tongzhi politics developed by Chou Wah-Shan proposes a culturally sensitive perspective to make sense of certain indigenous modes of homoerotic politics and to assess their practical and political efficacy. Drawing upon and refining Chous tongzhi politics, I apply it to a set of discourses surrounding the alleged but never verified homosexual scandal of Mao Ning, a popular Chinese male singer. It will become clear: 1) that tongzhi politics may actually operate alongside the global gay style, and 2) the combined use of both politics as hermeneutic guide yields fuller comprehension of the conditions in question and possibilities in making. At its best, the advancement of tongzhi politics relativizes the global gay style; that is, the global gay style is indeed neither global nor universal, but culturally and historically specific."

Recently, reacting to the fear of being locked in to buying from and associated with only one technology company, South Korean policy-makers have explored FOSS as a kind of a political metaphor: At an international level, FOSS offers a rare opportunity to free the country from its technological dependence on transnational software vendors. At a national level, it is an engine for technological innovation and for market competition. However, the market or business paradigm has dominated most discussions of FOSS in Korea. The economic paradigm of FOSS has been vulnerable and could easily surrender to the proprietary logic of the capitalist market. The present study argues that, within the public sector, government should develop an IT infrastructure encouraging greater freedom of choice, and that it should establish an electronic environment  such as community-based use of software technology  for citizens to use easily and freely. Basically, Koreas FOSS policies should focus on the free and open philosophy of software rather than on the market-driven or closed idea of software. To accomplish this goal, the Korean government must maximize the societal benefits of FOSS within the public sector, based on democratic criteria for technologies such as transparency, interoperability, and reliability."

Recently, a new model of intercultural communication was designed proposed and later empirically tested (Arasaratnam, 2004; Arasaratnam & Doerfel, in press). The present study was designed to test the model further and address some of the limitations of the previous test. Survey data were collected from participants (N = 400) and analyzed using regression analyses. The results mostly supported the previous model. This, in addition to some new findings in the relationship between empathy and intercultural communication competence are discussed."

In this paper, we explore psychiatrist-patient interactions in the distinctive institutional site of the UK NHS Gender Identity Clinic, where the psychiatrists gatekeeping role is renowned. We focus on some interactional features of the psychiatrists gatekeeping role as it gets played out, and oriented to in a specific class of questions that they ask transsexual patients. This class of questions involve the psychiatrist putting to the patient a possible future hypothetical scenario where the patients treatment is withdrawn. We show how these hypothetical questions function in the assessment of transsexuals, and how the psychiatrists institutional, gatekeeping role, is made manifest in the design of the hypothetical question, and in the response that is elicited from the patient. We suggest that in contexts where the doctor is a gatekeeper, hypothetical questions work rather differently than they have been shown to do in more therapeutic environments. We end by considering the extent to which hypothetical questions can be deemed a useful, or successful strategy in the psychiatric assessment of transsexuals."

This gender gap is relevant for research on entertaining mass communication, but holds also implications for access to information technologies and the development of media literacy. This paper ex-plores the reasons why females tend to dislike contemporary computer games. Based on a conjoint research design (N = 317), study 1 revealed that insignificance of social interaction within a game, and to a smaller degree, violence and gender role stereotyping repel young females from playing computer games. Study 2  an online survey (N = 795)  found evi-dence for the effect of competition orientation as a personological factor that explains gender-specific preferences for different (competitive versus non-competitive) game genres. Findings are discussed in the light of entertainment theory and the media socialization perspective."

There are three focal points - musical forms and expressions of Cantopop (style, lyrics, iconography, affect), gender politics, and everyday-ness---which are examined in order to propose that a notable cultural logic that performs an enlarging sense of ambivalence can be found in a city that has seen a shift from high moments of economic prosperity to the current postcolonial blues. Besides being a historical and politico-administrative shift, it is simultaneously a shift in our sensibilities, our redrawing of the affective map of everyday life."
2005-0625,Gender-based Stereotype Threat in Surveys of Political Knowledge,Theorizing the Feminine,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,Gender-based Stereotype Threat in Surveys of Political Knowledge,Theorizing the Feminine,"Men tend to achieve higher response accuracy than women on surveys of political knowledge. The reported research investigated the possibility that this performance gap is moderated in part by factors that render the communicative context of a survey intellectually threatening to women. Male and female college students participated in a brief telephone survey comprised of political and civics knowledge questions based on items from the National Election Survey. Two aspects of the survey context were manipulated: The alleged diagnosticity of the test (i.e., whether the test was portrayed as being sensitive to potential gender differences) and the gender of the interviewer. Consistent with previous studies of political knowledge, a robust gender difference in response accuracy favoring men was observed. This difference was reliably moderated by the manipulated factors. Womens performance on the survey was poorer when the survey was portrayed as diagnostic than non-diagnostic, and when they were interviewed by male than female interviewers. Diagnosticity and interviewer gender exerted no discernible effects on mens response accuracy. These results suggest that explicit and implicit cues reminding women of the possibility that they might confirm a negative gender stereotype can impair their performance in political knowledge surveys."
2005-0626,Gender Differences in Mood Management and Mood Adjustment,tudies in Entertainment,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Gender Differences in Mood Management and Mood Adjustment,Studies in Entertainment,"Mood management theory (Zillmann, 1988) has found ample empirical support but was also challenged by gender differences and exposure to negative content. These challenges are addressed while applying response style theory (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990) and the mood adjustment approach (Knobloch, 2003) to media selection phenomena. Hypotheses are tested with a re-analysis of a mood management experiment and original data from a mood adjustment experiment. Gender-split selection patterns were only expected for mediocre and negative moods but did apply regardless of mood valence. Right after an emotional experience, men tend to distract themselves with absorbing media stimuli, whereas women tend to ruminate the experience and thus prefer media message with low absorption potential. When anticipating an emotionally relevant activity, men tend to distract themselves right before it by selecting absorbing content, while women focus on it and thus prefer less absorbing messages."

2005-0628,Gender Equality in Language and Communication: Human Rights Perspective,Theorizing the Feminine,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,Gender Equality in Language and Communication: Human Rights Perspective,Theorizing the Feminine,"The subject-matter of my presentation is gender justice in language which, as I argue, may be achieved through the development of a gender-related approach to linguistic human rights. The last decades of the 20th century, globally marked by a gender shift in attitudes to language policy, gave impetus to the social movement for promoting linguistic gender equality. It was initiated in Western Europe and nowadays is moving eastwards, as ideas of gender democracy progress into developing countries. But, while in western societies gender discrimination through language, or linguistic sexism, was an issue of concern for over 3 decades, in developing countries efforts to promote gender justice in language are only in their infancy. My argument is that to promote gender justice in language internationally it is necessary to acknowledge the rights of women and men to equal representation of their gender in language and speech and, therefore, raise a question of linguistic rights of the sexes.My understanding is that adoption of Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights in 1996 provided this opportunity to address the problem of gender justice in language as a human rights issue, specifically as a gender dimension of linguistic human rights."
2005-0629,Gender Representation in Turkish Melodramas,Women in International TV,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,Gender Representation in Turkish Melodramas,Women in International TV,"Turkish melodramas present some intriguing gender relations and representation. In some cases, characters in melodrama break away from traditional gender roles. In this paper I would like to investigate why certain melodramas film between 1965 and 75 present non-traditional gender roles in Turkish society and how the hegemonic and the negotiated elements of male and female roles in theses melodramas are presented. There has been important feminist scholarship mainly in the United States and in England that examines the binary nature of the melodramas. Yet very little has been written on 'feminine elements' of male actors and 'active' female spectatorship. With my dissertation, I intend to help fill this gap.
Freudian and Lacanian modes of thinking by their nature are Eurocentric and applied to third world cinema, they naturalize the Western feminist perspective as global. In this paper I will focus on elements of Turkish melodramas that cannot be explain western modes of thinking, showing that a different and unique negotiated space within which the feminine elements of male actors and active female spectatorship exists side by side with the traditional, hegemonic patriarchal gender roles in Turkish melodramas between 1965-75. Also, most Turkish melodramas follow the 'fallen but redeemed by motherhood' formula that reestablishes the patriarchal order at the end. There are, however, some films from this period that defy this formula. An alternative look at these films is imperative, as current feminist theory has not addressed this aspect."

This paper analyzes NASCAR television events as ritual celebrations of a distinct ideology. The paper traces NASCARs development within the socio-cultural milieu of the mid-to-late 20th-century American South. Prerace coverage is treated as a prime opportunity to encode race events within a mythological discourse. It is argued that prerace telecasts seek to discursively construct NASCAR events as ritual celebrations of laissez-faire economics, ultra-conservative cultural values, and fervent nationalism."

One reason may be that the speaker and recipient are in a dialogue. We separated the variables of visibility and dialogue by creating three conditions: face-to-face dialogue (10 dyads), telephone dialogue (10 dyads), and a monologue to a tape recorder (10 individuals). Both dialogue and visibility had significant, independent effects on the traditional measure, speakers rate of gesturing (ps < .006). However, as predicted by the complementary principle of recipient design, visibility alone (and not dialogue) significantly affected how the speakers gestured: Speakers who were face to face made much larger gestures; they often put information in their gestures that was not in their words; they were much more likely to make a verbal reference to their gesture; and they included slightly more gestures referring to the interaction itself (all ps <.05)."

Especially, this paper focuses on interpersonal communication among college students in cooperative learning groups. Relying on the theoretical framework of self-determination theory, we propose that participation in interpersonal interactions would be enhanced by three basic psychological needs: competence (perceived communication competence), autonomy (perceived autonomy in small group contexts), and relatedness (willingness to establish and maintain interpersonal relationships with their group members). It was also assumed that these three basic psychological needs, which would be influenced by perceived environmental pressures, would affect degrees of active oral interactions among students, which, in turn, would determine degrees of class satisfaction. Using structural equation modeling, we tested the hypothesized causal links among the variables to modify the original model and produce a finalized model. For cross-validation, then, we tested the finalized model with an independent sample, to confirm the equivalence of the measurement and the structural paths across the samples."

I argue that girl power is a metaphor that rigidly locates young women in a fixed position as provides them with personal empowerment. Girl power functions as a mixed metaphor: girl is a fixed stereotype, while power is fluid, representing the potential of agency. I propose that girl power suggests agency masked by stereotype; thus, it is both subversive and reaffirming to the patriarchy. In this paper, I examine the values and ideals associated with the two juxtaposed terms: the traditional, fixed concept of the girl and the fluid associations of the term power as those terms are integrated into the notion of girl power. Finally, I examine the interaction of the two unique terms when juxtaposed in the mixed metaphor of girl power, both fluid and fixed, as an ideal of empowerment."

Such a community can incorporate several traditions as long as these traditions are willing to talk to one another in a meta-theoretical dialogue about the different perspectives. The aim of this paper is to join this dialogue by reflecting on a research program on communication and motivation from the perspectives of the seven traditions that Craig (1999) distinguishes in a map of the field. This map (that identifies rhetorical, semiotic, phenomenological, cybernetic, sociopsychological, sociocultural and critical traditions) is the basis for a meta-theoretical reflection on the topic and methodology of two studies within the research program. These two studies (a metaphor study that can been labeled as semiotic and a survey that has a sociopsychological stance) are the input for a reflection by the distinct traditions. This reflection leads to a range of commentaries, thoughts and suggestions on the studies and the way to investigate the motivation of organization members."

It is proposed that contemporary television systems operate under complex sets of determinants that together lead to several forms of programming. Through an analysis of Israeli TV and the impact global television flow has had on it, it is argued that the ways foreign content is presented to local viewers are more complex than previously acknowledged. A typology of six types of television channels is developed  one that privileges the various viewing perspectives and positions offered by various channels to Israeli viewers."

In so doing they originated a new kind of social movement, one that pushes beyond group identities around which social movements have traditionally organized and into the realm of network identity. This analysis of Zapatista websites and listserves examines the ways several key mythsof a universal Marcos, of noble savages, and of a neoliberal beasthelp structure the relationships among diverse members of the network. Examining the myths around which the movement is organized reveals how people go about creating network identities and helps us assess to what extent they are new and to what extent traditional roles and relationships are being played out in a new environment."

Traditional questions of political communication and press performance must be rethought in view of this changing public sphere, as journalists navigate between their traditional local/national frames of reference and more horizontal cosmopolitan outlooks. A growing cultural identification with this new dimension strengthens a global journalism profession and related expectations of citizens in the world community."

By focusing on the here and now of linguistic and paralinguistic performances and on the ensuing construction effects, analysis shows how the social world is produced and reproduced in the dynamics and structures of interactions. However, this does not elucidate how certain actors come to have more weight than others, a phenomenon that these approaches sometimes have trouble taking into account. In this chapter, we will attempt to show that a reflection on the effects of dislocation and globalization in communicational actions allows for an accounting of asymmetries in interaction. By way of some illustrations, we will show how it is possible to analyze these phenomena of asymmetrization without leaving the firm ground of everyday interactions."
2005-0662,Global Policing as Scopic Regime,The Spectacle of the Other After 9/11,Visual Studies,,,Paper,Global Policing as Scopic Regime,The Spectacle of the Other After 9/11,"Since the first Gulf War, we have witnessed a global repositioning of visual communication practices, utilities and techniques as regards political mobilization, identity formation, geographic perception, technocratic legitimation political violence, urban planning, public health risks, and human rights. This political realignment of visual culture practice culminated in the attack on the World Trade Center and subsequent geo-political responses. The circulation, dissemination and saturation of anthropologically threatening images of violence and social suffering have intensified in all those domains cited above. This iconic ordinance has been structured by normative yet tacit strategies of framing, positioning and stabilization to serve various political agendas and pedagogies that speak to risk perception. The World Trade Center disaster in New York, the Shock and Awe display and the Abu Ghraib abuses in Iraq were key global and spectacular expressions of this process. Such aggressive technologies of image making amd image imposition do not simply refract or record an event, but become the event by materially transcribing a political code onto the built environment, cultural memory and the politicized body. Examining the politics of transcultural perceptual systems of risk I ask: what is the visual structure of the historical and mediatic event; how do visual norms fashion postures of attention and inattention, memory and forgetfulness? How do visual cultures and technologies of risk and threat perception stratify sensory experience and affect how perpetuators and victims of violence and human rights violations depict their political experience as political truth and historical evidence?"

TV game shows, which have a blank slate quality, make them an ideal genre for cross-cultural analysis.
U.S. game shows have the following traits: male host, daily M-F schedules, non prime time slots, interactivity and non use of celebrities. All three countries prefer interactive games, but there similarities end. The present study found that Japan and China differ partly on three dimensions studiedformat, scheduling, hosts--and markedly on the penchant for celebrity players such as those on Hollywood Squares. (The obsession with celebrities is the most Japanese characteristic of game shows when they are viewed cross culturally.)
. In sum, Asian values when applied to TV tastes is a questionable conceptualization on a micro level. On a macro level, the two Asian cultures do contrast with the U.S. game shows. Who Wants to be a Millionaire? the exception that proves the rule, is the only show that has crossed from the West to both China and Japan."

Two groups completed a survey about their own flirting at work: 91 undergraduates who held part-time jobs and 146 full time employees. A 5 (goals) x 4 (type of behaviors) within subjects design was utilized. Results indicate certain flirting behaviors are more prevalent when flirting for social goals (i.e., for romance or for fun) whereas other behaviors are more prevalent when flirting for professional goals (i.e., career advancement, obtaining a favor). Status (part time/student versus full time) was a significant predictor of behavior when the goals were professional but not when goals were social. Men flirted more with subordinates and flirted more with the goal of romance than did women. The discussion highlights the importance of goals in understanding flirting behaviors in the workplace."

The frequencies of manifest cultural values in advertising themes and cultural symbols and icons in advertising creative tactics were examined to assess the cultural characteristics of early Western advertising in China. The study found that early foreign advertisers were cautious and culture-conscious when they entered an emerging market. Specifically, they utilized mainly Chinese and Eastern cultural values instead of Western ones in advertising themes. With the exception of brand names, they adopted mainly Chinese cultural elements in terms of language in copy texts and model ethnicity, settings, arts and artifacts in visual presentations. Both the central messages and the manner in which they were presented appeared to be more in tune with local culture than with incoming Western culture. This suggests some early efforts of foreign advertisers to negotiate and incorporate local cultural elements in order to help moving merchandize."

One hundred and seventy GTAs from a large northeastern research university completed a 25-item online survey. Quantitative data analysis reveals that email and course websites are most frequently utilized by the GTA population, while online quizzes, multi-media presentations, and video conferencing technologies are least likely to be incorporated into teaching strategies. The study also finds that GTAs would be more likely to incorporate a greater amount of instructional technology into their teaching if additional support and training were provided by the University, although many respondents report a general unwillingness to adopt certain technologies (e.g., online quizzes and video conferencing). Furthermore, qualitative data indicate that a sizable proportion of GTAs are skeptical of the increasing presence and potential impact of instructional technology particularly in regards to online courses and the implications of these trends on future professorial careers within higher education."

Research and marketing reports have mostly attended to adolescents online behavior as consumers rather than as citizens, however. This paper thus investigates the extent to which the Internet is embedded into youths civic life and the degree to which this new medium engages them in becoming citizens. Data were collected from 1,303 middle school students from Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei. The findings reveal that only 29 percent of the surveyed teens connected to the Internet to read news. In addition, although chatting and email exchange were common activities for youth, only a small portion in our sample engaged in political discussion online. Nonetheless, we found a positive role that the Internet can play in teens civic engagement. That is, for teens who consider the Internet helpful for informational and deliberative purposes, a greater level of Internet use was associated with a higher level of community services. The findings confirmed previous research that points to the factor of motivation as mediating the effect of the Internet. In other words, civic-minded Internet users are more likely to engage civically."

However, an important question that remains largely unaddressed is h.ow Turks of Turkey communicate their nationalism in the light of exemplars suggesting that Turkish Cypriots may be willing to sacrifice their identity as Turks to join Republic of Cyprus. The paper attempts to answer this question by analyzing discussion groups on two websites that target Turkish college and graduate students. Our analysis finds that discussants relied on metaphors of blood, heroism and sacrifice to emphasize the worthiness of the mainland Turks and argue that their sacrifices give them the right to determine the future of Cyprus and Turkish Cypriots. In addition, gender, family and sexual metaphors were frequently used to construct motherland Turkey as a pure, virgin female whose purity would be increasingly jeopardized if the father state of Turkey conceded the whole Cyprus to Greeks. Finally, the analysis suggests that discussants achieved a rhetorical construction of the collective identity through the strategic deployment of the difference between the Turkish us (heroic, selfless) and the Turkish Cypriot them (vulnerable, selfish)."

One of the largest online dating sites, Match.com features a link where couples who have met on the site can submit a narrative description of their online courtship and subsequent relationship. Specifically, this study documents the prevalence of three of Galicians myths: 1) the myth that each of us has a soul mate; 2) the belief in love at first sight; and 3) the ensuing desire for such a relationship to complete you so that you live happily-ever-after."

While several books and articles have been published offering general methodological guidance regarding the Internet as a whole, almost without exception they deal with basic and broad questions, without specific focus on e-journalism. This paper delves into the very specific (but substantive) methodological problems and dilemmas that journalism sites design and format present the researcher interested in doing quantitative content analysis (including ads, layout, communicative actions, etc.). It offers concrete suggestions to the researcher for each of the twenty problems raised (in ten categories), with special emphasis on comparisons (similarities and differences) between print and electronic newspapers. Most of the problems discussed, and proposed solutions, are relevant to research regarding other types of Web sites as well."
2005-0672,Hard Wired for Negative News?: Gender Differences in Processing Broadcast News,Women and the News,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,Hard Wired for Negative News?: Gender Differences in Processing Broadcast News,Women and the News,"This study experimentally investigated information processing of broadcast news at the intersection of audience gender (male versus female) and message valence (positive, negative and ambiguous). Both audio and video dimensions of stimuli were manipulated to create the three valence conditions. The data produced interactions between gender and message valence for self-reported arousal, as well as recognition memory and comprehension of news content. In particular, male viewers are associated with a negativity bias, reporting the highest arousal levels and producing the best recognition memory and comprehension scores for negatively valenced messages. Women, in contrast, show signs of an avoidance response to negatively framed news, rating positively valenced stories as more arousing as well as processing such messages more effectively than negatively framed messages. Within the information processing paradigm these findings suggest that the gender variable deserves more research attention. The results also have important implications for journalism."
2005-0673,Health Advocacy through Photovoice: A Reconsideration,Health Communication Poster Session,Health Communication,,,Paper,Health Advocacy through Photovoice: A Reconsideration,Health Communication Poster Session,"This paper focuses on an alternative advocacy strategy of health intervention, photovoice. This strategy aims at empowering the marginalized group in a community by offering cameras to them so they could document their living environment and critically reflect upon their health needs. Photovoice is fundamentally a purposeful, reflexive, multilevel advocacy strategy that facilitates the self-representation of the marginalized to achieve empowerment goals. Using one earlier implementation of photovoice and a more recent one as case studies, this research paper situates photovoice in community-based visual media practices, and hence, reconsiders the theories and practices in terms of three constructs different from its original theorization: critical pedagogy, the politics of self-representation, and campaign evaluation. The discussion of empowerment permeates all categories of analysis. The paper affirms the empowerment potential that comes with photovoice. Disempowered groups enter photovoice project as subjects, not passive objects being acted upon. In engaging in collective and communicative praxis, participants are able to tell their own stories through the photos they take. Using visual aids helps to enlarge the pool of interlocutors, hence, consolidating and amplifying the storytellers voices. It also generates dialogue among the participants and between the participants and their communities. Such dialogue is crucial in strengthening the fabric of the communication infrastructure while fostering a sense of belonging that enables collective action for social change. Photovoice also gives marginalized groups a venue to use their own visual productions to speak on their own behalf to the policy makers."
2005-0674,Health Information Avoidance as Uncertainty Management,formation Seeking and Uncertainty Management,Health Communication,,,Paper,Health Information Avoidance as Uncertainty Management,Information Seeking and Uncertainty Management,"Uncertainty is a dominant feature of the experience of health. Past research has assumed that the response to uncertainty will be reducing that uncertainty through information seeking, but health information avoiding is another important potential response. This paper means to investigate those situations in which information might be avoided, so that uncertainty might be maintained or even increased. Narratives about avoiding information were solicited from 507 undergraduate students. Participants offered reasons for avoiding information including wanting to maintain the possibility of denial, feeling overexposed to a topic, feeling that no (or no more) action can be taken, finding the available information or source flawed in some way, managing negative emotional reactions, maintaining boundaries, protecting privacy, and avoiding interference with enjoyable or habitual activities. Reasons not to avoid included personal characteristics, a general interest in learning, a need to take action (or be prepared to), the importance of health issues generally, and the dangers of avoiding health issues. Participants also described how they would avoid information including reframing how they thought about a health issue, avoiding health care providers, blocking pop-ups, turning off the T.V. or changing the channel, avoiding tests, avoiding telling others, avoiding health campaigns, purposefully not paying attention, changing the topic, and denying or withholding the truth about a health issue. The results demonstrate that information avoiding can and does occur. The results indicate that a range of emotions involved in information avoiding, and strategies maybe used in conjunction with one another to manage uncertainty."

It has been well documented that people perceive media reports as being biased against their own point of view and in favor of the opposite, an effect labelled hostile media perception. It is argued here that assumptions on heuristic and systematic processing can be used for explaining hostile media perceptions. People with little ability and/or motivation are expected to perceive an article based on heuristic cues whereas highly motivated and/or able people should process information more systematically bringing about an effect of attitude.
The assumption for systematic processing could be confirmed while there was no evidence for heuristic processing under low motivation/ability conditions. Results of prior hostile media research are replicated."

Battle for Korea portrays the Korean War between 1950 and 1953 by synthesizing archival films from China, Korea, and the Soviet Union. Through this analysis of Battle for Korea, this paper will explore two issues: (1) How history documentaries legitimize their authority of interpreting history by utilizing audiovisual aesthetic conventions of the documentary; and (2) how the media institution imposes unspoken rules of ideology in constructing narrative structure."

The six components of the HBM (perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy) are used to hone message frames for examining the content of HIV/AIDS posters from 15 African countries. Analyses indicate that almost one quarter of the posters have none of the HBM-based frames and that self-efficacy is the most common of the frames. In addition, multilevel analyses consider the influence of social-landscape indicators on HBM-based frame prevalence. Findings here suggest that countries that are most in need of HIV prevention are infusing more HBM-based frames into their HIV/AIDS posters than countries that are less in need."

This study examined 158 pregnancy stories, 1999-2001, in Japan and in Western nations chosen for their varied Masculinity (MAS) rankings: the United Kingdom, 66; the United States, 62; Canada, 52; and Finland, 26. Results revealed that the higher MAS countries gave virtually the same amount of coverage as the lower MAS countries. Regarding content, the highest MAS country, Japan (95), showed a clear focus on pregnancy as a topic; further, the higher MAS Western countries tended to portray Masako more traditionally than the lower MAS countries. Thus MAS levels do not appear to affect volume of coverage, but may affect the substance of coverage. Finally, the study found a low use of honorifics in Japanese headlines, indicating that Masakos pregnancy had a role in bringing the royal family closer to the Japanese people.

Seventy-four activist Web sites were analyzed. About one-third (32.4%) included organized online press rooms. The most common media relations materials were: organizational history (70.3%), organizational mission statement (54.1%), organizational publications (47.3%), press releases (33.8%), and policy papers (31.1%). Activist Web sites did not provide strong dialogic features for journalists, but dialogic features were more available for the general public. Six recommendations are made for improving online activist press relations."

In this study content analysis was used to compare the visual content of advertisements that appeared in the mainland Chinese versions of these global womens magazines. The question that prompted this research was: How are women of different races stereotyped in advertising in global media? The researcher compared how Caucasian and Asian models were represented in these global ads and found that different races were used in different product categories and stereotyped as different beauty types."

The degree of influence was tested by ten media types and by three issue stages. Qualifications of how an issue shifted from being a cyber issue to off-line action was suggested and tested. In particular, a Three-Stage Cyber-Issue Diffusion (CID) Model was proposed that identifies an issue cycle in cyberspace as a forming stage, a diffusion stage and an action stage. Through factor analysis, the type of media was categorized into three groups such as off-line mass media group, individual media group and Internet homepage group."

Interactional Issues in the Exchange of Potentially Sensitive Information.,"Doctor/Patient Interactions: Accounts, Authority and Asymmetry","Using Conversation Analytic methods, this exploratory paper examines the dynamics of discussions when physicians are seeking information from patients about their consumption of alcohol and when patients are providing reports about their consumption of alcohol. Two excerpts are closely examined in order to see what kinds of concerns become demonstrably relevant for interlocutors and how they manage those concerns. The sequential environment in which such matters may be raised is considered. It is argued that physicians and patients negotiate the kinds of measurement metrics (frequency and quantity) that will be used to discuss alcohol consumption. Finally, patients efforts to frame their drinking behavior in comparatively positive social-moral terms are discussed."

Profiling Disputants' Framing of Intractable Environmental Conflicts,Top Four Papers in Organizational Communication,"Traditional stakeholder theory focuses on the role of the focal firm in addressing organizational problems and typically treats stakeholders as members of homogeneous groups. Other scholars challenge this assumption and claim that stakeholders are not monolithic role-based groups. This study contributes to this debate through examining how stakeholder members cohere with their traditional groups in the framing of four intractable environmental conflicts, ones that differ in duration. The research reveals a complex picture of both homogeneity and heterogeneity in stakeholder framing, one that stems from the relationships among conflict sites, framing clusters, and traditional stakeholder groups."

A Content Analysis,Issues and Activist Groups in Public Relations,"The research examines how major U.S. newspapers used press releases issued by the Mexican government during the countrys public diplomacy campaign in the US. Results showed that a high percentage of the press releases was quoted, mostly by the NYT, but the newspapers tend to quote the press releases in stories with conflict theme and problem stories about events that may affect the bilateral relations, such as immigration and crimes. Press releases about cultural events appeared to be best used. The research added to the literature of agenda building."

Built on the influence-of-presumed-influence model, this study adds the moderating role of peer proximity  i.e., close friends versus general peers. Analyzing direct effects in a survey of 1687 middle-school students, we found that anti-smoking media message had boomerang effects among ever-smokers (experimenters and established smokers) and never-smokers. However, analysis of indirect paths revealed significant effects in the opposite (intended) direction  effects also moderated by peer proximity. Respondents perception that close friends, but not general peers, are more influenced by such messages led to a significant decrease in their favorable thoughts toward smoking and intention to smoke. The data suggest that antismoking messages may only achieve their desired effect via the indirect-influence path."

Such claims, though reasonable, need to be specified further through carefully designed studies that test the effects of hypothesized media system characteristics on news discourse, a task best accomplished via cross-national research. This study compares political news coverage during the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s in France (Le Monde, Le Figaro) and the United States (The New York Times), two national media systems that differ systematically in their relation to the market and state. In addition to developing new quantitative indicators for news content, our research challenges many of the findings of the political communication literature rooted in single-country case studies. Contrary to the assumption that state intervention inhibits critical news coverage of politics, critical coverage was relatively higher in the more state-dominated French press. Despite being more ideological, the French press was also more focused on the political game than the American press, which contradicts the usual assumption that a game schema is due to a disengagement rather than engagement with politics. We also found that the more commercialized American press offered a narrower range of viewpoints across civil society and that French-American journalistic differences have not diminished since the 1960s. We conclude with a discussion of the historical and structural factors that can help explain our findings."

A total of 421 articles from four major newspapers, Chosun Ilbo and Dong-A Ilbo in Korea, and the American newspapers, The New York Times and USA Today, were analyzed. We found that Korean newspapers covered Viagra as a medical drug rather than an influencer, whereas American newspapers more frequently framed Viagra as social influencer. Also, it was determined that American newspapers more frequently used drug manufacturers and patients as their information sources, whereas, Korean papers utilized government and international or foreign news as their information sources. More findings and implications are discussed in detail."

These videos include dominant themes, or frames, to establish a candidates initial portrait. However, the studys findings indicate several ways in which viewers constructed their own meanings from the prepackaged frames that they saw. In many cases, those meanings were intertwined with viewers pre-existing frames of the candidates, the current political climate, and how a president should look and sound."

Specifically we examined similarities and differences in the activities, beliefs, emotions, and expressions of love in friendship and marriage. Sixty Americans and 83 East Asians took part in the study. Participants were asked to list activities, beliefs, emotions, and expressions associated with love to a spouse and friend, respectively. Using inductive methods, we analyzed each of the similarities across and within cultures. Sports, food, and shopping were activities associated with love for Americans, while talking and food constituted typical activities for East Asians. For emotions, happiness, warmth, and other types of positive emotions were common to Americans and East Asians. However, caring was more common among American respondents, while trust was associated more with East Asians. Americans and East Asians reported that caring, trust, respect, and honesty were all important beliefs about love in friendship. In contrast, love in marriage was seen in more absolute terms for Americans, while East Asians were more likely to report trust and caring as important. Finally, American and East Asian respondents expressed love to a friend through acts of support, open discussion, and the sharing of common experiences. In contrast, all respondents reported that they express love to a spouse through physical intimacy, acts of support, and expressions of love such as I love you and I miss you"

I argue that the political interventions employed by CWA are reshaping how UN negotiations occur around gender and sexuality issues in significant ways for both feminist and conservative pro-family groups. I also argue that in some surprising and unsettling ways, there are places of convergence between western feminist and anti-feminist discourses, in terms of making representational claims for women, especially pertaining to non-western subjects. As one concrete illustration of this, my essay scrutinizes how sex trafficking of women is being framed in CWAs publications and policy papers as a new international problem that must be remedied through education, prayer, and prosecution. The Bush II administration has provided funds for faith-based NGOs, such as CWA, to address this issue that both contradict and complement feminist NGO efforts. Understanding that both feminisms and religious nationalisms are forces that attempt to address local and global conditions, transnational feminist cultural studies offers the opportunity to think about the terrains on which discourses and knowledges are produced in complicated and meaningful ways, within the larger contexts of globalization and transnational politics."

An Assessment of Communication in Inter-Organizational Context,Developing Communication Strategics for Social Change,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,ICT as an Enabler for Humanitarian Relief? An Assessment of Communication in Inter-Organizational Context,Developing Communication Strategics for Social Change,"Throughout the 1990s, humanitarian crises in developing countries have become more frequent and complex, resulting in extensive international involvement. Coordination among relief organizations has often been reported inappropriate, with delayed relief as a consequence. By approaching communication as a basic driver for coordination, this study aims to provide a framework situating communication within a broader social and technological context, with a particular focus on the role of ICT and its potential for enhancing relief. Organizational needs, inter-organizational cooperation, and ICT use directly influence communication, but are at the same time situated depending on particular local context. Together they frame specific communication processes and potential for ICT use. In particular, the study finds that it is mainly political agendas by both local authorities and relief organizations that shape how communication processes will develop, thereby creating a need for use of ICTs, as well as at the same time restricting its potential."

The paper also explains that the market-based approach of the ICTs for development agenda further consolidates the dependency of the developing countries on Western countries."

Previous communication research studied this concept either as perceived similarity (similarity identification) or the desire to be similar to the media persona (wishful identification). As an exploration to conceptualize the factors of this process, this study consisted of two phases: semi-structured interviews and a quantitative/qualitative survey. Participants were undergraduates at a large Midwestern university as well as their family and friends. Themes related to both similarity and wishful identification were identified in the interviews and used to construct a survey containing open-ended components, which were thematically analyzed for the presence of the themes. From this content analysis, three types of identification were found: pure similarity, pure wishfulness, and a combination of the two. Additional findings relate wishful identification to themes of inspiration and being satisfied with one's self. The conclusion asserts that identification should not be consigned as consisting of just one type. Also, the temporal dimension of identification, where perceived similarity is either current or a future possibility, should be studied with a weighted approach, where individuals are asked to rate the importance of the specific component in their identification with a media persona."

In attempting to become accustomed to a different environment, they often experience changes in their self identity constructs. Such changes result from their socialization as students in the United States. In this paper I explore identity constructs and socialization of international students in the United States as a host country. I examine several important aspects of international students' experiences in America. The research includes the current identity constructs of international students, the extent to which they identify themselves with each construct, their purpose for studying in the United States, their concerns, how they attempt to resolve the problems, and with whom they socialize in the host country. The results show that most international students maintain a strong identity as citizens of their country of origin. However, the majority of them report changes to the mixture or the relative magnitudes of their identity constructs. They report that their major concerns are language difficulties and societal discrimination. But they are actively trying to get better with language and also trying to fit in better socially by studying harder and socializing with Americans more."
2005-0717,Identity in Transition: TV Portrayals of Bulgarian Women,Women in International TV,Feminist Scholarship,,,Works in Progress,Identity in Transition: TV Portrayals of Bulgarian Women,Women in International TV,"Who is the Eastern European woman today? Is she is a worker, a mother, a political force, perhaps neglected and impoverished, or a prostitute? Or is she a success story by measures of western feminist scholars? This study in progress will attempt tp provide insight into the curent status of gender perceptions in Eastern Europe while studying portrayals of women on Bulgarian television. Given the unique set of social, economic and cultural factors which define the reality of Eastern European nations, women in these transitional societies are faced with tremendous economic pressure and the huge challenge of re-defining their role and their social image. Nowhere else is the cultural identity of gender more contested than in visual media. In fact, after the end of communism, there has been a strong movement towards what some feminist scholars call the aggressive masculinization of women. Two manifestations of this phenomenonthe prevalence of images of passive women in the media and the commercial eroticization of the female bodyare particularly relevant to the study at hand. Because media, and specifically, television as the most powerful visual producer of cultural signs, are perceived as reflecting the social and cultural norms of a given society, studying portrayals of women on television will present a revealing look into how post-communist female identities are being engendered and constructed."

Nowhere is this more important than in the realm of politics, where ideologically disparate groups often compete for the same vote. This study presented participants with a news story about a fictional extremist group that shared the same issue with a real social movement group they had selected as either their most or least-liked group. After reading the news story, participants indicated the extent to which they would vote for or against a candidate based on their support or opposition to the group. The findings demonstrate a consistent interaction between the ideology of the respondent and least- vs. most-liked group condition. Specifically, liberals were more likely to vote against the group they opposed and in favor of the group they supported than were conservatives. Implications of these findings for political action and voting behavior are discussed."

This paper is part of a first detailed study on two forms of strategic infidelity  infidelity based on revenge and relational dissatisfaction. About 2,000 adults filled out an online survey assessing vengefulness, relational quality, infidelity justification, actual cheating behavior, infidelity likelihood, infidelity revelation, and relational outcome. The results indicate vengefulness is a predictor of infidelity. Vengeful people tend to have cheated in the past, and are likely to cheat in the future regardless of their cheating history. Vengefulness also predicts infidelity justification, and the more infidelity is perceived as justified, the more one is likely to cheat. However, vengefulness does not predict more face-threatening revelations of infidelity. Women are more vengeful in infidelity and female cheaters are more emotionally involved in affairs than male cheaters. Discussion addresses limitations of this study and directions for future research on strategic infidelity."

Utilizing textual data and audience survey responses, I examine how the writers and directors of the series emphasize nature versus nurture when representing the two father-son dyads on the show  Clark Kent/Jonathan Kent and Lex Luthor/Lionel Luthor. Despite these overt, highly scripted desires, audiences do not identify with this overarching textual argument in the series. Instead, audience respondents identified both fathers as less than ideal role-models, and expressed concern for both young mens depiction in the series. By examining communication literature related to father-son communication patterns, and weaving the textual and audience elements of the series together through grounded theory analysis, critical implications emerge about the cultural stakes of representing father-son relationships in media."

In recent years, the use of online support groups has become a popular source of additional social support outside of immediate family and friends. However, the electronic environment prohibits warm hugs, smiles, and other components of traditionally supportive behavior. Therefore, it is important to know whether the verbal exchange that constitutes an online support group can provide effective social support. A previous line of research has shown that highly person-centered messages, which explicitly elaborate, acknowledge, and legitimize the feelings of distressed individuals, are perceived as more supportive, helpful, caring, and appropriate by support recipients. The present study examines messages exchanged in online breast cancer support groups according to this established person-centered hierarchy. A sample of 416 messages was selected from two online support groups and coded by reliable coders. Findings suggest that women with breast cancer are selecting highly person-centered messages to comfort their peers."

Young Peoples Perceptions About Video Game Influence,"Sex, Lies, and Video Games: The Influence of Television, the Internet, and Video Games on Teens","Video games are gaining in popularity and use among young people at the same time that researchers are discovering negative effects of violent video game use. In a context in which concern from researchers, policy makers, and parents about the effects of video games on young people is on the rise, what do young people themselves think about the potential for playing to negatively influence them or others? This study examines the third-person perceptionsthe idea that individuals think others are more susceptible to negative media influence than they are themselvesof early adolescents. The developmental characteristics of the age group are assessed in applying third-person effect theory to explain patterns in data from a survey of 118 6th and 7th graders. Results show these early adolescents think that both others of the same age and younger others are more susceptible to aggression, desensitization, and mean world syndrome effects of playing violent video games than them. There is also support for the social distance corollary of the theory, in that respondents viewed kids at other schools as more susceptible to influence than their friends or their classmates, in addition to themselves. Finally, the potential of two variables, the amount of exposure to video games and the degree of liking of video games, to impact third-person perceptions is examined, with findings showing limited support."

These practitioners most commonly defined success in managerial and strategic terms. The most common contributors to their own success were strong communication skills and being proactive. Favorable tipping points in their own careers occurred most often when they gained or improved an essential skill or in the face of a crisis or special project. The executives advised newcomers to PR careers to perfect technical skills, attend to personal characteristics, know their business field, and gain diverse experience. Findings are linked to theoretical and pedagogical considerations."

When the topic of the paparazzi arises, it is usually in reference to their relationship with celebrities and their privacy. Rather than examining the celebrity-paparazzi issue through the lens of privacy, the purpose of this paper is to reframe the issue by examining it through the lens of image and reputation management/control, concepts rooted in the field of public relations. This requires that we begin to think of celebrities less as individuals whose privacy is threatened and more as businesses that are trying to create the most unified image possible in order to increase their cultural and economic power. In this view, celebrities, along with their associated support staff, are constantly attempting to present a unified image, one that may be countered by the paparazzi."

These were the now infamous photographs taken and distributed by American soldiers at the prison in Abu Ghraib in Iraq before rocketing to stardom on Sixty Minutes II. At around the same time, consent for the war in Iraq seemed to be unraveling. The decision to wage war on Iraq was framed in terms of heightened insecurities facing the American state even though as a response, war is the most drastic alternative available in terms of its consequences and human cost. Open democratic accountability and dialogue about the ethical consequences of such responses is crucial. This paper asks: what is the role of visual imagery in this dialogue? Do photographs intensify affect, allowing people to see the true costs of war? Or are images so well managed today that ethical responsibility for warfare can be evaded? The argument is often made that contemporary forms of highly technological warfare alongside modes of managing newsflow and imagery have engineered greater consent to military responses to insecurity by controlling affect. This paper examines this claim and the part played by visual communication in relation to consent to the Iraq War."
2005-0726,Imagery Technology and Transparency as Realist Narrative,Visual Studies Interactive Paper Session,Visual Studies,,,Paper,Imagery Technology and Transparency as Realist Narrative,Visual Studies Interactive Paper Session,"Since the early 1990s, high-resolution satellite imagery, composed of a vast system of architectures that were formally developed and monopolized by the US military-industrial command economy, have become more widely available to the civilian public through a combination of declassified data sets, commercial satellite operators and imagery vendors, and value-added resellers of imagery data. This paper seeks to complicate notions of transparency that are discursively associated with satellite imagery systems, architectures, and interpretation practices. I consider an epistemological problem of satellite imagery that has been contemplated for both the map and the photographic image, which is, does the image/map constitute a mirror or a text? Through an historical comparison between map making, photography, and satellite imagery interpretation, different articulations of transparency are explored and out-lined. Satellite imagery is a socio-technical articulation of a modernist, positivist, or realist narrative about the relation between subjective experience and the real world out there, and sits within cultural discourses associated with various and often contradictory concepts of transparency."
2005-0727,"ImagiNation: News Discourse, Nationhood and Civil Society",Constructing Reality: Issue Framing,Mass Communication,,,Paper,"ImagiNation: News Discourse, Nationhood and Civil Society",Constructing Reality: Issue Framing,"How is nationhood constructed and represented in situations of protracted crisis? Building on Billigs concept of banal nationalism, this paper explores the discursive performance of nationhood in conditions of extreme political and often military conflict. Such circumstances, the paper argues, can lead to an affirmation of nationhood through the conspicuous performance of seemingly autonomous, grass-roots social affinities, independent of the state and organized politics. These media representations of affinity from below produce a paradoxically non-banal banal nationalism, whereby the everyday resilience of sociality itself may be turned into a national value, and ultimately into a myth of national character. This demonstrative form of banal nationalism is called mediated civic nationalism since it appears to be embedded in the everyday activities of civil society, and because it is primarily represented, constructed and imagined through the mass media.
Exploring an extreme instance of news discourse in circumstances of protracted conflict (Israeli television coverage of a suicide bombing of a bus in Jerusalem), the paper identifies several discursive strategies for the performance of mediated civic nationalism. Together these interweave the interactional and narrative dimensions of news stories, involving viewers and journalists in networks of interpersonal acquaintance and shared experiential spaces, assembling an image of the social totality from the combination of social sub-units, and separating it off from the networks and experiences of marginalized others. Among their political implications are the depoliticization of civil society and the production of civic stoicism as an ideology of quiescence."

A theory-based mass media campaign promoted walking and local community-sponsored wellness initiatives via radio, billboards, posters and newspaper advertisements in a Missouri town over four months in 2003. Using a post-only design, a survey (N=297) was conducted to assess campaign impact. One in three survey respondents reported that they had seen or heard campaign messages on one or more channels. Reported exposure to the campaign was positively associated with two of five pro-walking belief scales  social and pleasure benefits  controlling for demographic, health status and environmental factors, and with one of three community-sponsored activities  participation in a community-sponsored walk. Exposure was also positively associated with one of three general walking behaviors, number of days per week walking, when controlling for age and health status, but this association vanished when beliefs were introduced into the model, consistent with a mediating effect of pro-walking beliefs on the exposure-walking association. These results support a claim of campaign impact: that a media campaign can promote walking beliefs and behaviors, especially when linked to an active community-based effort."
2005-0729,Impact of an Entertainment-Education Television Drama in Bangladesh: An Application of Propensity Score Matching,Effects of Exposure to Health Information: Measurement and Attribution Issues,Health Communication,,,Paper,Impact of an Entertainment-Education Television Drama in Bangladesh: An Application of Propensity Score Matching,Effects of Exposure to Health Information: Measurement and Attribution Issues,"Shabuj Chaya is a weekly television drama broadcast during a 13-week period in Bangladesh in 2000. It used an entertainment-education format to increase health knowledge and to promote visits to health clinic and modern contraceptive use. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how a relatively new statistical technique, propensity score matching in conjunction with structural equation modeling, can be used to obtain an unbiased estimate of changes in health outcomes that can be attributed to exposure to the drama. The analysis is conducted with data from an after-only, cross-sectional survey of 4,492 men and women from the intended audience. The results from propensity score matching approximate what would be expected from a randomized control group design."
2005-0730,"Impact of an Integrated Public Health Communication Campaign on Awareness, Preparedness and Behaviors Related to Maternal and Neonatal Health",Health Communication Campaign Evaluations,Health Communication,,,Paper,"Impact of an Integrated Public Health Communication Campaign on Awareness, Preparedness and Behaviors Related to Maternal and Neonatal Health",Health Communication Campaign Evaluations,"This paper uses survey data from an impact assessment of an integrated maternal and neonatal public health communication campaign from West Java, Indonesia. The campaign combined a mass media component with both intensive and general community mobilization activities. This paper examines differences in knowledge, preparedness for safe childbirth and behaviors among four groups of women: those unexposed to the campaign (Group1); those exposed only to the mass media component (Group 2); those exposed to the mass media component and general community mobilization activities (Group 3) and those exposed to the mass media component and intensive community mobilization activities (Group 4). Results from multivariate logistic regression models show that exposure in general is associated with increased awareness, advance preparedness for childbirth and improved behaviors. Exposure to a combination of the mass media component and intensive community mobilization activities are clearly associated with a further boost in the indicators under analysis. However, increasing the levels of exposure is not significantly associated with increased use of skilled attendance during childbirth and immediate postpartum care. Also, respondents exposed to the mass media component alone and a combination of the mass media component and general community mobilization activities do not differ significantly for many of the indicators. Overall, the results affirm the importance of integrating mass media and intense community mobilization activities in creating an environment of positive maternal and neonatal health outcomes."

Family environment, parent-child communication, and parental attachment were hypothesized to be mediators of the effects of parental drinking on self-esteem. Participants (N = 515) completed self-reports of parental drinking, family environment, parent-child communication, parental attachment, and self-esteem. Results of the path analysis showed support for the mediational model; neither paternal nor maternal drinking had a direct effect on self-esteem. Paternal and maternal drinking directly impacted family environment, which mediated the effects of drinking on parent-child communication and paternal and maternal attachment. Family environment and parent-child communication both had indirect effects on self-esteem through their effects on attachment. Results are discussed within the context of the literature reviewed. The study concludes by highlighting the importance of COA research for practice"

However, online portals feature news recommendations based on collaborative filtering. To investigate how these recommendations affect information choices, ninety-three participants browsed through online news that featured either explicit (Avg. Rating) or implicit (Times Viewed) recommendations or no recommendations (control group), while news exposure was logged. Participants picked more articles if the portal featured explicit recommendations, and stronger explicit recommendations instigated longer exposure to associated articles. For implicit recommendations, a curvilinear effect emerged, as both low and high numbers induced longer exposure than medium ones."
2005-0733,Impact of the Pragmatic Value of Web Ads on the Conventional Model of Advertising Effects,Web Advertising and Pop-Up Ads,Information Systems,,,Paper,Impact of the Pragmatic Value of Web Ads on the Conventional Model of Advertising Effects,Web Advertising and Pop-Up Ads,"The construct of pragmatic value of the advertisement is introduced as a potential antecedent to conventional attitudinal effects (attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the brand) in predicting purchase intention of the advertised product. In a test of 54 Web sites by 63 subjects in three replications, strong evidence from structural equation models indicated that pragmatic value of the advertising site produced effects on attitude toward the site and not vice versa. These effects were independent of the product class involvement of the advertised product. This outcome implies that the design of Web sites for commercial purposes should focus on providing a valuable message to potential consumers, rather than attempting to optimize affective response. It is thus more consistent with exchange theory than with the conventional attitudinal effects model of mass media advertising."

Respondents evaluated banners after they reviewed a web site in which a contextually relevant banner and a contextually irrelevant banner were placed. Results suggest that (1) a contextually relevant banner induced more favorable evaluation and a greater purchase intention toward advertised products than a contextually irrelevant counterpart, and (2) neither a contextually relevant banner nor a contextually irrelevant banner was recalled better than the other banner. These findings provide implications for future consumer research and the development of advertisements on the Internet"

This interplay between technology and communicative acts has been examined extensively in the classroom and the workplace and continues to extend from the desktop to the surroundings of everyday experience. This same phenomenon is also unfolding in the public space of art museums. We will look at how attribution of value and use of social presence information emerges amongst three different populations: museum experts/staff, museum aficionados (i.e. frequent museum visitors), and general museum visitors. From these three populations, we will examine how these groups construct meaning around new uses of technology in the public space of the museum. Will these new uses of technology, which make the attribution of value and use more salient to participants in the communicative acts, change the existing conversations and roles in museums?"

This study examines gender differences in interpersonal motives and uses of mobile phone. The six interpersonal motives (inclusion, affection, control, pleasure, escape, and relaxation) were measured in the contexts of using voice call and text messaging, respectively. The results suggest that people prefer text messaging to voice call to satisfy their interpersonal needs. As for gender differences, (a) women have higher level of interpersonal motivation than men in using two channels, (b) women use text messaging more frequently than men, and (c) men use voice call slightly more than women. The implications of these results were discussed in terms of womens uses of media technology. We concluded that interpersonal media such as mobile voice call and text messaging were efficient tools for maintaining interpersonal relationships and fulfilling communication motives, especially for women."

Findings suggest that previous experiences with mental illness, opinions about mental illness, and certain work practices are important factors in writing about mental illness. Additionally, respondents indicated that use of expert sources, amount of violent content in the story, and reporting deadlines influenced their selection of news leads about mental illness."

This paper introduces a conceptual model to examine how consumers respond or avoid the ads on the Internet. The main purposes of this study are to understand different types of consumer characteristics as well as to provide information about the individual differences in responses to advertising under online environment (e.g., ad perceptions and avoidance).
The findings indicate that cognitive styles and personality were critical predictors of ad perceptions and avoidance. Situation variables such as communication problems and negative experiences of the findings are discussed in the study."

Fairness and global relationship equity were expected to be positively associated with relationship satisfaction. Indirect power strategies were hypothesized to be negatively associated with relationship satisfaction. Research questions explored the power strategies used by individuals to negotiate the division of household labor and the association between power strategies, perceived fairness, and relationship satisfaction. The results confirmed the predictions that perceived fairness and relationship equity were associated with relationship satisfaction. Direct bilateral strategy use and the indirect bilateral strategy of hinting were associated with the perceived importance of fairness and with perceived global inequity in the relationship. The perceived importance of fairness and relationship satisfaction were both negatively associated with indirect unilateral strategy use (negative affect, withdrawal, and laissez-faire). Implications are discussed."

Effects of Trope and Openness,Visual Studies Interactive Paper Session,"Visual rhetoric has a positive effect on the appreciation of print messages. The role of the interplay of picture and text is an extension of this line of research. Print advertisements were tested containing metaphors created by the combination of pictorial and verbal terms. Non-metaphorical variants were made by combining the same pictorial terms with different texts. In both variants, the interpretation of the ad was either unmistakable (closed) or in need for additional inferences (open). It was investigated whether respondents, varying in age and education, would differentiate between types of advertisements for appreciation, comprehension and affect. Furthermore, it was established in which way comprehension and affect constituted appreciation. Results show that non-metaphorical open (or inappropriate) ads have more effect than closed metaphorical ads. Comprehension has a stronger effect on appreciation when metaphors are used."

Public relations professionals define influence in terms of shaping decisions, having access, and being heard. These professionals said they were most influential in crisis situations and when preparing communication messages or plans. They are least influential in strategic decision making, when theyre perceived as technicians, and in interactions with senior executives. The most common influence tactic used by these professionals was rational influence. The authors suggest eight tenets regarding influence for public relations practitioners."
2005-0759,Influence of Transnational Policy Networks on Multistakeholder Participation in World Summit on the Information Society,Communication Networks in Organizations,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Influence of Transnational Policy Networks on Multistakeholder Participation in World Summit on the Information Society,Communication Networks in Organizations,"In December 2003, the UN convened the first phase of World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), a process designed explicitly to stimulate the development of an emerging international regime for the governance of the information and communication technologies and policies on which the information and knowledge society is being built. The broad scope of these deliberations  domain names to cultural heritage  raises the stakes for these normally arcane global information and communication policy processes, which is complicated even further by the increasingly multistakeholder nature of participation. This paper investigates the degree to which transnational policy networks are present within the WSIS processes, explores their linkages with knowledge producing epistemic communities, and assesses their impact on effective participation in the Summit. Four primary research questions shape this paper: (1) To what extent do transnational policy-actor networks exist within the WSIS policy formulation processes? (2) What is the relationship, if any, between these policy-actor networks and existing epistemic communities? (3) What factors most significantly influence participation in a transnational policy-actor network within WSIS?; (4) What factors most significantly influence effective participation in WSIS? Using both qualitative and quantitative data from an international survey and participant observation at WSIS and its preparatory processes, we find significant evidence of policy networks, and their influence on the effective participation of delegates. However, while we do find a significant relationship between country status and membership in a policy network, we find no such relationship on linkages with epistemic communities."

Journalists identified, on average, 3.3 sources per story, though 40 percent of the stories used two or fewer named sources. On average, 42 percent of a storys text was without any source attribution. Men outnumbered women 2 to 1 as named sources. A majority of stories relied on government and other official sources, while community members and other ""ordinary"" people were rarely cited. The data did not support the hypothesis that fewer errors would occur when more sources were used but the news story held greater credibility when more sources were cited. Going beyond examination of front-page news, the study provides a new benchmark in source diversity research by examining all locally produced stories (except sports and commentary) appearing throughout the newspaper."

Focusing on media attention as an important variable in the processing of media information, this study will look at individuals cognitive perceptions, attitudes and behaviors to test the intended media effects, or as a result of antismoking communication or exposure to tobacco marketing. Additionally, to address the conceptual notion that childrens cognitive capacity may be different from adults, the study will look at the influence of childrens age on processing media information about smoking. The findings will add to the limited literature for predicting how children process mediated antismoking messages."

The research contends that individuals can be located along a continuum based on their conscious engagement in evaluating information quality. Based on the cost-benefit paradigm from behavioral decision theory (Beach & Mitchell, 1978; Johnson & Payne, 1985; Payne, 1982) the research focus on two dimensions of information quality assessments, namely the perceived efficiency of sources and the perceived effectiveness of information. The research has developed a reliable and valid scale to measure ISS and is currently testing an integrated model of information search sophistication within the framework presented in the Theory of Motivated Information Management (TMIM: Affifi & Weiner, 2004). The scale has been evaluated for dimensionality, reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, predictive validity, and lack of social desirability using multiple samples of college students and adult samples across a variety of domains. Some domains within which ISS has been tested are cellular phones, personal computers, public library use, and credit card choice."

EUs IST Policies, WSIS and an EU Candidate Country Perspective",Fostering Dialogue and Democracy Through Communication Policy,"The first phase of the World Information Society Summit that took place in Geneva in December 2003 added another dimension to the already complex dynamics of global information society governance. The 1990s, were marked by a number of radical initiatives implemented in order to bring ICT regimes increasingly outside of the national domain: the 1993 agreement, in which communication was treated as a service, and signed by 130 countries with the WTO, and the 1997 Agreement on Basic Telecommunications Service, signed by 69 countries were major milestones toward an internationalized communications regime. Accordingly, in the 1990s, EU and US implemented vigorous telecommunications and IS policies. This article, which is built on a recent case study of the EUs IST (Information Society Technologies) policies vis-à-vis candidate countries is an attempt to provide an insight into the current efforts to internationalize questions such as digital divide and communication rights from a country-specific perspective. The focus remains on the discussion of the Turkish experience with regional IST policies, while I link the findings and arguments with the vision put forth through WSIS. The point of departure for this case study of Turkey is the contention that telecoms infrastructure and the social shaping of national policy constitute the building blocks for the emergence of an IS. In other words, not only does the telecommunications infrastructure constitute the material basis for information society, but the nature of and stakes around the infrastructure in a given context might ultimately determine the nature of the IS."

Scholars suggest that hybrid spaces of electronic networks and urban sites herald the future of city planning and design, representing a fluidity of material place and cyberspace that transforms patterns of city life. This project examines the regenerative capabilities of ICTs in decaying urban neighborhoods that link virtual networks of community participation and expression with the physical presence of community media centers. This project uses the framework of symbolic interactionism and qualitative interviews to suggest that inner-city residents find ICTs to be a key element in neighborhood revitalization and to the revival of community. Overall, this research considers the notion that the Internet and ICTs are integral components of contemporary urban planning."

A four-phase experiment was conducted involving 298 participants. The results confirmed the role of known elements in the process of resistance: the core elements of threat, issue involvement, and counterarguing output facilitated resistance, as did the more recently introduced elements of attitude certainty and attitude accessibility. Also, the results indicated that inoculation treatments modified the structure of associative networks, planting additional nodes and increasing linkages between nodes. Subsequently, these changes in the structure of associative networks contributed to resistance to counterattitudinal attacks."

Our talk is routinely novel, and yet our understanding of the processes that give rise to such creativity is in its infancy. Moreover, everyday experience suggests that some people are simply better at thinking on their feet than are others. The current study sought to ascertain whether there is some stable individual difference at work in message production or whether our impression of individual differences is more apparent than real. The results of the study affirm our everyday intuitions that people do differ in their message-production abilities, at least insofar as we can generalize from the sort of simple SITUAION-ACTION-BECAUSE narratives under examination here. Additional analyses suggest that this individual difference in message production ability is distinct from extraversion, but may be related to social knowledge and skill. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed."

Most of research explored the issue based on reception studies, but this paper investigated the critical thinking of audiences founded on Hannah Arendts philosophy. As a result of this writers four years of working as an ethnographer of an online fan community about Japan novelist Murakami Haruki in Taiwan, three stages of audience critical thinking were identified. First, the operation of imagination was observed when audiences transformed their experiences to a thought-object by the de-sensing process. In the second stage, general communicability was found to be the core criterion audiences used to elaborate upon the fruit of their thinking. In the third, audiences did go-visiting from the perspective of others but stayed in their own identities. Simultaneously, their homeless-thought inclinations allowed them to forsake the traditional systems of moral judgments; thus, they remained in permanent disorder and perturbation. In conclusion, critical thinking capability of audiences is the process, not the outcome, of thinking; and the meaning they build individually is the starting point of thinking journeys."
2005-0770,In Search of a Standard: Four Models of Democracy and Their Normative Implications for Journalism,"Global Issues, Global Society: A New Journalism?",Political Communication,,,Paper,In Search of a Standard: Four Models of Democracy and Their Normative Implications for Journalism,"Global Issues, Global Society: A New Journalism?","In the literature about the impact of media and journalism upon democracy, media and journalism are often critized for their content and their negative effects on some aspects of democracy. This has raised the question of proper news standards by which the quality of news journalism should be evaluated. However, both the previously proposed news standards as well as the criticism against it has one important shortcoming. That is that neither the proposed standards nor the critics are clear enough in the specification of the model of democracy used as a normative departure.
This article argues that the question of proper news standards can not be seen in isolation from the question of different normative models of democracy. In order to find proper news standards by which the quality of news journalism can or should be evaluated, it analyzes four normative models of democracy and their demands upon citizens: procedural democracy, competetive democracy, participatory democracy and deliberative democracy.
Building upon that analysis, the question this article ask is: What normative implications for media and news journalism follow from the perspective of procedural, competitive, participatory and deliberative democracy?"

Success has been attributed to various factors: users and applications, socio-cultural characteristics, economic performance of major telecom players, governments strategic investment, and the influx of international market forces. Although these perspectives help explain the telecom growth, this paper is meant to sharpen an understanding of Koreas success by focusing on the institutional determinants. For the purpose, concentrated structure of government and corporate institutions and the close association between the two groups are highlighted. It is analyzed how the relationship is revealed throughout a series of policy decisions that marked changes in the evolution of two industries. Analysis shows that both regulatory and pro-competitive policies were embraced by government to enhance the competitiveness of the industries. Finally, the paper moves to policies regarding the deployment of the next generation network (NGN). The relationships among corporations and government institutions will influence the shape of policies toward NGN, especially as the future telecom realm is marked by the convergence between technologies, industries, and policy regimes."

Based on a mailed survey to a random sample of 1,500 Americans, our study showed that opinion formation for support of agricultural biotechnology followed 2 routes. A communication route was confirmed, although the impact of the news media on attitudes toward the technology was limited, and mediated by informal learning processes. A second route to opinion formation, through deference to scientific authority (a new construct introduced in our study.), was shown to be the main path for opinion formation in the case of support of agricultural biotechnology"

These values encourage the sacrifice of individual goals for the greater good of the whole. In opposition to such claims, we argue that this stance is a gross over-simplification of the relationship between collectivism, harmony, and interpersonal relations. Exploratory research using correspondence analysis indicates that conflict and self-focused instrumental behaviors are also embedded within collective societies. In fact, conflict in its latent stages may masquerade as harmony. In addition, an instrumental orientation is shown have a stronger relationship to collectivism than to individualism."

Theoretical approaches that are examined include social cognitive theory, health belief model, protection motivation theory, and diffusion of innovations. Factors that cut across theory and predict information seeking and behavior change are: characteristics of behavioral request; level of personal involvement; perceived threat; response efficacy, self-efficacy, constraints; emotional arousal; use of opinion leaders; and social norms."

I explored the influence of organizational justice on employee-organization relationship types and outcomes. Organizational justice is a relatively recently developed but widely used concept in organizational studies that refers to the extent to which people perceive organizational events as being fair. The data collected from 31 Korean companies showed that employees who perceived that they were treated fairly by their company tended to develop and maintain communal relationships with the company. Also, when employees felt that they were treated fairly by their company, they were likely to hold more commitment, trust, satisfaction, and control mutuality than when they perceived that they were treated unfairly."

Prostate cancer patients were as serious and thorough users of information services as were breast cancer patients in previous clinical trials, but they were considerably less interested in Discussion Group. Outcome analyses showed the ICCS group improved more than the control group. However, despite random assignment, the ICCS group initially was considerably worse off and less capable of dealing with prostate cancer. Patients given this system may have benefited more than those given books on several important outcome measures, but the results are not conclusive."

Overall, there were some signs of interactivity in the way consumers used commenting functions available on retail websites. When the comments on the Korean website and the U.S. website were compared, U.S. comments exhibited a higher level of user control and consumer-to-marketer reciprocity. Korean comments and U.S. comments were also different in their verbal styles. Korean comments were shorter and exhibited more homogeneous valence than U.S. comments. These differences in the level of interactivity and verbal styles were discussed in the context of the influence of technology and culture on communication."

Central to this task is our argument that service learning and participatory action research should inform international collaborations among communication researchers and colleagues abroad focusing on specific needs, problem solving, and the development of global civic awareness and action among all the participants. We describe two partnerships, one involving service-learning, research and social action in Kenya, the other involving teaching and research collaborations in Cuba. For seven years, the first author has been involved in a sustained collaboration with The Greenbelt Movement in Kenya concerned with environmental, community development, and civic issues. The second author established collaborations with technical and business communication faculty at several universities in Cuba nearly three years ago. These two partnerships illustrate several of the mutual benefits arising from such international teaching, research, and action. Our focus involves the commitment to international collaboration as a political act, which is consistent with what we consider to be an activist approach to the study and practice of communication."

The results indicate that while the relationship between public relations counsel and media coverage was minimal at the level of object and substantive attribute salience, linkages were observed with affective attribute salience. In general, public relations counsel was associated with a decrease in the amount of negative news coverage. At the level of individual news stories, it was connected to increased positive valence in media content. For the dimensions of news coverage associated with public relations, media salience was related to public salience and attitudes regarding foreign nations. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed."

The Internet has replaced the nayan or the traditional matchmaker or communicator in Indian arranged marriages. It is a vehicle of social change in a country where pre-marital relationships are frowned upon. The availability and accessibility of the Internet offers Indias urban youth the opportunity to meet each another and to converse without fear of being socially rebuked. This quantitative-based paper will conduct a survey among Indias college-going youth. The approach of the paper will be a combination of media and gender studies and feminist studies, approaching the theoretical background from a feminist political economy perspective. The Internet is also a feminist tool for empowering women who do not see the need of waiting for someone else to arrange their marriage, or for the groom to visit several brides before making his choice. It gives women who hitherto have not had the opportunity, the choice to make friends from members of the opposite sex, without fear of social rebuttal. This paper will attempt to answer what is the attitude of Indian men and women to dating and online relationships, what factors influence them to look for online dating partners, and to take online dating into the real world. How do online relationships affect cultural and intercommunication practices of Indian men and women, and how does online dating bring a social change for Indian women?"

This study examined Internet Dependency Relations (IDR) as a predictor of online consumer activities among Internet users in the U.S. and India. IDR is based on the theoretical perspective of micro-Media System Dependency theory, which postulates dependency relations between individuals and media based on the perceived helpfulness of media in meeting understanding (social/self), orientation (action/interaction) and play (social/solitary) goals. Within a context of primary online activities (e-commerce, information search, communication, and entertainment), relationships between IDR and activity exposure, involvement and satisfaction were investigated. Data were collected through a cross-sectional online survey administered to a non-probability sample of U.S. and Indian Internet users (n= 700).

Regression analysis found that generally IDR for action orientation, interaction orientation, and social understanding goals exerted a positive influence, while IDR for self understanding goals exerted a negative influence. In addition, information search activities appeared to be driven by social understanding goals, e-commerce activities by action orientation goals, communication activities by action and interaction orientation goals, and entertainment activities by play goals."

Six online news sites in Hong Kong and mainland China were selected for investigation. The findings indicate that the news sites in Hong Kong, which enjoy a high degree of Internet press freedom, acted as interactive crisis managers, and contributed in a number of ways to the management of the SARS crisis in the community. On the contrary, the news sites in the mainland China, which are restricted by media censorship, served as governments online agent of containment. The findings show that news sites were able to offer efficient warnings, timely education, and a network of support during the crisis because of the unique characteristics of the Internet medium. However, due to the constraints on Internet press freedom, the Chinese sites were unable to take full advantage of the Internet medium to play a positive role in the management of the crisis."

External entities, such as governments and commercial industries that invade peoples rights to be left alone are of less concern now that individuals voluntarily give up their privacy by willingly providing personal information for other benefits on the Internet. Also, in the interactive environment, intended and unintended activities of more diversified and less easily identifiable entities become more of a threat to individual privacy. In this new environment, rather than providing privacy for passive individuals, a more user-oriented, active approach is needed to help users protect themselves from more diversified and unknown forces and potential loss of control. This paper suggests that focusing on the right not to be identified on the network by allowing affirmative acts of secrecy and deception regarding identity and identification might be the most effective - and sometimes only practically viable - way of ensuring privacy in the interactive environment."

Playing as a platform for information retrieval and a communication vehicle, Internet has the potential of enhancing interpersonal relationships and information richness, and henceforth facilitating the adaptation of international immigrants.

This paper investigates the patterns of Internet use by immigrants as their adaptation process unfolds and seeks to identify the correlation between Internet use and intercultural adaptation. The study focuses on the Chinese immigrants in Singapore who account for 5% of the population of the ethnically complex nations in the world. The research methods are, however, carefully designed such that the findings from the study would be applicable to the immigrants from other ethnic groups and to other host countries than Singapore.

The results show that immigrants tend to change their preferences on the Internet use along their residence in the host country. More importantly, the differences in the Internet use are found to have significant impacts on the intercultural adaptation of immigrants. In an online environment, the host social communication is a critical component that can facilitate or impede immigrants successful adaptation to the host country, whereas the ethnic social communication also plays a role at the initial stage of transition."

Intrinsic and extrinsic motives were operationalized as personal interest and expectations of future relevant discussion, respectively. Respondents received a manipulation that elevated the expectation of discussing certain topics with unknown students and then viewed a newscast featuring these topics. Personal interest in and information acquisition of each message were assessed, along with anticipations of topical discussion with friends or family. Results showed that intrinsic and extrinsic interests related positively to information acquisition indicators for the relevant news stories. In addition, extrinsic motives were found to influence intrinsic motives. Implications for viewing traditional media effects research in conjunction with epistemic motivation research are discussed."
2005-0807,"Interpretability and Social Power, or, How Postmodern Advertising Works",The Body & Advertising,Mass Communication,,,Paper,"Interpretability and Social Power, or, How Postmodern Advertising Works",The Body & Advertising,"Drawing on Jürgen Habermass theory of communicative action and his notion of intelligibility, the author argues that postmodern media culture increasingly relies upon an orientation toward validity that the commodity aesthetics of modern advertising did not tend to require. The article includes an analysis of the ideas of interpretive action and intelligibility and a demonstration of the thesis in a contextualization and analysis of an emblematic case of postmodern advertising. The author concludes that, far from necessarily signaling a profound crisis in meaning as some commentators affirm, a postmodern media culture that relies more and more on the interpretive communicative competence of its addressees suggests both greater potential power for cultural commodification as well as greater potential resistance to this by consumers."

We report results from two experiments that examine how online interruptions influence users cognitive and affective perceptions toward both the interruptions and the Website that features them. Study 1 examines a social characteristic of interruptions and manipulates interruption type in terms of pop-ups and pop-unders. Study 2 employs a factorial design and explores the interaction between a social characteristic (interruption type) and a cognitive characteristic (interruption content), while increasing the frequency of interruptions during an information-processing experience. Findings from the two studies point to the psychological relevance of interruptions and provide a holistic perspective on the role of interruptions in influencing user cognitions and attitudes in Web-based environments."

Examining material from a number of link-up programmes co-produced and broadcast by London Greek Radio, a diasporic radio station broadcasting in Greater London and narrowcasting through the internet, and participant and audience responses and attitudes to them, the paper attempts to explore the nature and impact of these programmes. In particular, I focus on the processes of construction of transnational and local diasporic spaces that unfold during and after the particular broadcasts and investigate the ways in which perceptions of home, nation, community and locality are reconfigured. I argue that link-up programmes, through their incorporation to the media-related experience of their audience, constitute a resource to which audiences resort in the process of making sense of their diasporic condition and constructing and reconstructing aspects of their identities."

(Top Three Paper),Social Identity Processes in Intergroup Communication,"The dominant view of communication efficacy rests on the assumption that effective communication relies on the interpersonal skills base of the interlocutors. This study presented an alternative perspective through an investigation of the processes involved in intergroup communication competence. Self categorization theory was employed to propose that categorization is a functional process, enabling positive outcomes in both intragroup and intergroup communication exchanges. Results suggest that two primary processes guide communicative behaviour to influence efficacy in the categorized context. The access to, or expectations of, a shared interpretive framework for ingroup members may make the communicative episode an easier process for interlocutors and therefore enable a more effective exchange. The additional motivation to work for the benefit of the ingroup may facilitate effective exchanges in both intragroup and intergroup contexts. Whilst directly enabling intragroup exchanges, this motivation may also enable intergroup exchanges if it is perceived that to work with the outgroup member will lead to a benefit for the ingroup. These findings present an optimistic view of the opportunities afforded for communication in the intergroup context. In so doing, this study challenges the perspective that categorization sponsors aggravated intergroup relations and that effective communication within the intergroup context can only be effected through the individually oriented application of communication skills."

Analysis of the transcribed data revealed that the most common reasons for wanting to donate organs were based on religion or a desire to help other people in need. The most common reasons cited for not wanting to donate organs were mistrust (of doctors, hospitals, and the organ allocation system), a belief in a black market for organs in the U.S., and deservingness issues (that ones organs would go to someone who brought on their own illness, or who could be a bad person). The most surprising finding is that religion is offered far more often as a rationale for wanting to help sick people through organ donation than it was for not wanting to donate organs. These findings both support and contradict past studies based on quantitative survey data. Implications for the construction of more effective future organ donor campaigns are discussed."

This paper examines the validity of extending these characteristics to intractable interpersonal conflicts and the ability of dysfunctional communicative behaviors to distinguish intractable interpersonal conflicts. Undergraduate students were randomly assigned to complete questionnaires about an irresolvable conflict, a resolvable conflict or a resolved conflict. Participants reported on conflicts in romantic relationships or parental relationships. Three of Colemans characteristics distinguished irresolvable interpersonal disputes: persistence over time, hopelessness and resistance to resolution. The dysfunctional communicative behaviors examined  combativeness and disrespectfulness  did not distinguish intractable interpersonal disputes. Future research directions are discussed."

In a first step, a conceptual model of the mechanisms of advertising mediation was developed, and in a second step, this model was experimentally tested drawing on a sample of 5- to 10-year-old children (N = 206). Structural equation modeling analysis confirmed that factual mediation reduced advertising persuasion by stimulating childrens cognitive responses (i.e., advertising knowledge and skepticism), while evaluative mediation reduced advertising persuasion by influencing childrens affective responses to advertising (i.e., attitude toward the commercial). The 5-6-year-olds had difficulty in processing the mediation strategies, while among the older children both factual and evaluative mediation were successful in modifying the effects of advertising."

Applying the Normative Model of Public Deliberation in Comparative Media Content Research,Top Papers in Political Communication,"This paper reviews recent research that uses a normative model of public deliberation in the comparative empirical analysis of mass media content. A twofold relationship exists between normative claims and empirical knowledge, with normative claims serving as a heuristic for more comprehensive empirical studies and empirical knowledge serving to better understand the nature of obstacles to the realization of the norm. It is then shown that deliberativeness is most likely to be realized in countries characterized by the absence of extreme forms of clientelism and ideological polarization. Finally, it is argued that the operationalization of deliberativeness must take into account apparent differences in the cultures of journalism. A proposal is developed for measuring deliberativeness of print media content in different cultural contexts, based on Hallin and Mancinis recent distinction between a Liberal, a Democratic Corporatist and a Polarized Pluralist model of the relationship between media and politics."

Using a student sample from a large mid-western university, it was found that the source of the candidate-sponsored negative ad was rated higher in the primary dimensions of source credibility (i.e. character and competence), than when the source of the ad was an independent sponsor. However, between those who saw the candidate-sponsored ad, the independent-sponsored ad, and those who did not see any version of the ad, there was no difference between ratings of the ads target (intended effects) or the targets opponent (unintended or backlash effects)."

on Employee Communication
Abstract
This study extends research in the area of organizational communication, particularly the relationship between leader influence and employee communication. Through an organizational case study, research involved nine qualitative, in-depth interviews across five months at an international franchise food service organization headquartered in southeastern Pennsylvania, U.S.A., to understand the influence a company leaders values, faith, and vision have on employee meaning-making through workplace communication and internal public relations. The study found that employees held positive perceptions of the leaders influence on internal communication and participatory decision-making strategies. Specifically, the founding leaders transformational, charismatic style and faith, values, and vision combined with the organizations team-based management was found to foster open, two-way symmetrical communication, participatory idea generation and decision-making, and strong employee-leader and employee-employee relationships. Interview results lend support to many previous studies regarding the influence of leadership style, employee communication, and participatory organizational culture on internal public relations excellence. This study uniquely extends previous research by connecting leadership style and leader values (individualized consideration) with employee perceptions of internal workplace communication processes."

By examining the historical context within which the form developed, and by incorporating a contextual typology with which to frame the avant-gardes discourse, it will be shown that historicizing this moment of jazz may be best suited to thinking of it as a cultural archive. It will be shown that it was the avant-gardes political agenda that ultimately hindered its reaching a mass audience."

Forms of resistance included oppositional tensions, military metaphors, and dualities that surfaced in the central themes of the campaign. These discursive strategies revealed ironies of advocating unity while promoting division and arguing to eliminate a two-tiered pay scale while supporting class distinctions between pilots. These tactics were similar as well as different from the approaches that oppositional groups of conventional unions typically used. Overall, these strategies pitted pilots against pilots, professions against professions, union against union and suggest that organized resistance is constructed discursively and ironically and in tandem with routine resistance evident in an historical context."

This paper draws on an analysis of the content, form and participants of the main online discussion group for people with a genetic susceptibility to deep vein thrombosis and contrasts this with interviews with English patients with genetic thrombophilia. The online discussion was mostly created by acutely or chronically ill people and focused on the use of anticoagulant medications with potentially serious side-effects. The off-line interviews rarely touched upon anticoagulants, and thrombophilia played a minor role in the mostly asymptomatic interviewees lives. The study suggests that research analyse the particularity or local culture of virtual support groups in order to better assess their usefulness to different people and public health. This is particularly important within the new preventative genetics associated with complex interacting risks, which add up to significantly different individual risk-profiles."

Dialogic attitudes continue to influence the development of new public relations theory, from relationship management to rhetorical approaches. But the contemporary public relations version of dialogue has been negotiated into a parallel connectivity whose conditions are satisfied as long as both participants are simply talking to each other.

Should we, as critical thinkers about the profession of public relations, be satisfied with this?

The paper is situated within the context of the High Performance Schools initiative on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. I conclude that dialogue is not only desirable but also essential from both a practical and moral point of view. However, this dialogic process might result in these schools being called upon to implement changes they are unable  or unwilling  to undertake: a potential Pandoras box of unfulfilled expectations."

As technology advanced, music became a private good which was sold as a commodity. Now, by the use of audio encoding software and the Internet, music is becoming a public good once more. Only the marginal cost of bandwidth, which is directly related to the distribution of music files through the Internet, prevent its full return to public good status. This unusual situation necessitates new economic strategies in order for the music industry to survive. A short review of the history of the music industry, and key cases involved with control of its content, provide context for the economic discussion. Two economic models, rival-compliments price-discrimination, are considered and then used to create a hybrid approach that involves the creation of new social norms about music. Future directions for academic research is presented."

Often these expressions occur quickly, in a form called a microexpression, particularly in situations where the emotional expression would violate some social norm. We tested whether we could train laypeople and professionals to be more accurate perceivers of such fleeting emotions. Using a standard pre-post test design, undergraduates and US Coast Guard personnel were randomly assigned to training or no training control conditions where their abilities to detect posed expressions of emotion shown for 1/15th of a second, as well as their abilities to spot microexpressions occurring in natural behavior streams, were tested. The results showed that participants improved their accuracy at detecting microexpressions by about 50% with 15 minutes of concentrated training, whereas there was no such improvement in control groups. These data suggest that with proper training one can readily improve emotional sensitivity and thus communicative competence in all situations where emotions may be"
2005-0823,Is Empathy Simply an Extension of Sympathy? Responses to Child Abuse Prevention Messages,Health Communication Poster Session,Health Communication,,,Paper,Is Empathy Simply an Extension of Sympathy? Responses to Child Abuse Prevention Messages,Health Communication Poster Session,"We propose that sympathy responses and empathy responses to health communication content are a function of two distinctive processes. While sympathy draws upon a persons awareness of another persons perspective, empathy is an emotional response that emphasizes a viewers own experience of the feelings of another person. Our experimental results (n = 108) illustrate that sympathy and empathy response are not significantly correlated and that different models predict each variable. Predictors of sympathy suggest that such response is, in a sense, more rational, whereas empathy appears to stem from a more affective process. Such findings hold a number of implications for health communication researchers, ranging from simple provision of construct clarification to underscoring the need for further theoretical work. Campaign planners seeking to evoke such responses as a strategy need to be aware that sympathy and empathy apparently are not simply varying degrees of the same construct."

It also describes how new media sales, increases in artist, marketing and production costs, employee lay-offs, the end of the CD-replacement cycle, changing demographics, and used CD sales influence profits for the big 4 music companies. This paper argues the net result of sales decreases during 2000-2003 did not mean the music industry was losing massive amounts of money, nor did it mean it was going out of business. Several of the big 4 music companies increased their profitability between 1999 and 2003, which suggests file-sharing has had a minimal impact on industry net worth. The author suggests the music industry will be around for some time to come."

Through a multi-faceted search of primary and secondary data the paper offers an exploration of the process by which Israeli journalists of the State of Israel's early years forged their communal identity. It explores the ways in which Israeli journalists of that era thought and wrote about issues such as the importance of the journalistic profession; the sources of their own professional authority; reporting conventions; and their assessments of good and bad journalism and the proper ways to distinguish the two.
By doing so, the paper portrays and analyzes the interplay between the stories Israeli journalists of that era told as professionals and the stories they told about their profession. At the same time, the paper also considers the stories that mainstream Israeli journalists of formative era agreed not to tell, as a way of illuminating their perception of what it meant to be a worthy Israeli journalist. Finally, the paper offers an exploration of how the fundamental tensions between ideological and professional affiliations were concretized via various journalistic ""sites of contention."" It indicates how debates over specific issues such as preferred journalistic writing styles, or the optimal relations between Israeli media and the military censor, could all be better comprehended within the larger context of this process of communal journalistic self-definition."

Overall, we found no agenda-setting difference between the headline only and the headline with brief formats. Each condition led to a substantially stronger media agenda/user agenda correlation compared to a control group, but they were nearly identical in magnitude. This result, however, masked an underlying difference between the treatment groups. For the top two story topics in our experimental media agenda, the treatment groups yielded differing agenda-setting effects. The headline with brief group was more strongly influence by stories concerning war on terror and the war in Iraq. The conclusion is that strong agenda-setting effects were apparent for both conditions (compared to the control group) but of equivalent size overall. The effect of headline format was felt when it came to which stories users selected, therefore, on which agenda items moved and which did not."

The present paper has aspired to suggest the most current view of the media planning literature, based on the Journal of Advertising Research. This paper will cover a 5-year period, 1999-2003.
There are two approaches to the planning of media, namely the Media Approach and the Consumer and Audience Approach. The most recent topics which were published in the Journal of Advertising Research can be categorized under three headings: the Quantitative Method of Media Selection, the Qualitative Method of Media Selection, and Strategic Issues. These three groups of topics can be broadly divided into the Media Approach and the Consumer and Audience Approach."

California News Content and Narrowing Public Debate on Bilingual Education,"International & Development Subdivision, Intercultural & Development Division Interactive Paper Session","This paper examines the historical conflation of English language with being a good American, and how this nationalist notion plays out in the impending crisis of Latino migration to California. In order to investigate the rising anti-Mexican sentiment in the state, I investigated the ongoing acrimony at the socialization site of the future American citizen: the California public school. I analyzed 143 California newspaper articles related to bilingual education beginning in January 1998 and ending in November 2003. Through frequency statistics and textual analysis, this paper shows a consistent narrowing of debate on the issue of bilingual education, so that opponents and proponents alike argue this issue according to the effects on one racial group: Latinos. The acrimony over language use in primary education and appropriate testing, show schools as the site where nationalist ideological borders are enacted. As this narrowed debate, clearly shown in the analyzed articles, reflects this singular focus, it simultaneously widens the discussion back to two larger debates: the outer limits of the imagined American nation, and the ambivalence of Californians toward migration across the southern border."

Most of this research measures identification as a relatively stable and enduring construct for organizational members. Only sometimes does this literature examine multiple targets of attachment simultaneously and almost never does it examine variations that might occur as individuals interact with various others during different activities. The research reported here draws on Scott, Corman, and Cheney?s (1998) communicative model of situated identification to investigate differences in identification with various organizational targets across three communication-based situations. Survey questionnaire responses from 174 volunteer members of a nonprofit arts organization reveal a number of findings supporting the utility of several situational measures of identification."

The fact that vinyl records have not disappeared but have become newly meaningful, in a culture rife with sophisticated forms of music distribution, suggests that we must complicate our understanding of the relationship between technology and culture by examining the persistence of old technologies. Archival and ethnographic analyses indicate that when vinyl enthusiasts celebrate the aesthetic, tactile, and sonic superiority of records, they are not simply romanticizing the past, but are articulating the abstract relationship between technology and humanity by grounding it in more concrete qualities. By examining vinyls transition from a mass to a niche technology, as well as collector cultures role in this transformation, this project illuminates the ways individuals invest old technologies with new meanings that resist the perceived implications of rapid and constant technological change"

Drawing on panel surveys and media content analyses the study provides a compelling link between exposure and attention to specific media contents and knowledge and participation. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom since we find the strongest learning and participation effects from exposure and attention to television news rather than newspapers. However, these effects are contingent upon the content of the news, so that only exposure to news programs that reported elaborately about politics had positive effects. The results are discussed in the light of research on media effects and political participation."

Considered an essential feminine text, the film Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles Avenue (Chantal Akerman, 1975), deconstructs the classical in a variety of ways by focusing on the studied presentation of the everyday activities of a womans life, framed in long cuts of medium or wide-angle which allow the viewer time to linger on the images, and the use of minimal dialogue which requires the viewer to discern meaning primarily through images instead of having meaning thrust upon them. These characteristics can be applied to large format films, a filmic medium that is primarily associated with museums, but is now moving to stand-along theaters. This work in progress considers the place of large format as possible feminist films based on technological characteristics and the mode of production and offers a reading of the potential breakdown of the masculine gaze."

This process occurs through what Basso (1979) calls epitomization, or the use of distortion and contrast to develop representative figures as the butts of jokes. This paper refines Bassos ideas to illustrate how epitomization can be used to develop ideal representative figures as well. In particular, the paper demonstrates how fans of the University of Nebraskas football team, the Cornhuskers (Huskers), use internet-shared jokes to epitomize both the ideal of Husker and the more general grouping of Others defined as non-Huskers. The contrasting, distorted epitomizations point to how Nebraskans conceptualize their cultural identity in ways that, importantly, are consistent with the performances of Nebraskans/Huskers on and off the football field. Consequently, Nebraskans in different physical locations may symbolically position themselves with other Nebraskans by affiliating with The Huskers."

In Britain, Follwoing 9/11, there has been a general move towards more draconian immigration policies with emphasis on nationalist discourse and dichotomy of 'us versus them'. This has found echo in sectors of the British print media rhetoric of reporting asylum seekers.
The central argumetn of the paper is that the 'politics of naming', i.e. naming and shutting out the reality of the subalter 'Other - asylum seekers - is employed by British press by the dichotomy of 'us versus them'. The paper relies on the debates around media representation of the 'Other' and on post-colonial theory to analyse recent examples of the representation of asylum seekers in the British press."

This study focuses on analyzing Liang Qichaos views on journalism. Departs from previous scholarship that either focuses on exploring the links between Liangs journalistic notion and that of Habermass of a century later or attempts to determine the roots of Liangs journalistic ideal in Mencius and other Confucian traditions that were nurtured centuries before, this study seeks to shift scholarly attention to the immediate context in which Liangs idea of journalism was proposed and contested. Seeing Liangs journalistic ideal as a historically specific formulationproduct of and response to the complex dynamics among competing discourses of his own time  this study is an attempt to provide a more complete picture of the discursive construction of Chinese journalism in the end of the nineteenth century. It also asks the important question of why Liangs notion of journalism became the dominant discourse in the late nineteenth century and has remained influential in China throughout the twentieth century."

A distinction is made between two sets of routines. One set is permanent and ensures ethnocentric control over the flow of information while a second set varies as journalists construct coherent narratives for particular events. This latter set of routines is further broken down into what are labeled a ""Victims"" mode and a ""Defensive"" mode of reporting. A Victims mode is used when one's own people have suffered an especially tragic loss of life while the Defensive mode is employed when one has carried out an attack that has led to a similar loss to the enemy. Each of these modes of reporting parallel psychological reactions that have been found in individuals. While terror management theory helps illuminate the underlying logic of Victims reporting, the research on defense mechanisms provides insights about the Defensive mode of reporting.
The ideas raised in the theoretical discussion are explored by comparing coverage of two events by Israeli, Palestinian, and Al-Jazeera television. Two events were chosen for analysis: a Palestinian suicide bombing that killed nineteen Israelis and the killing of Hamas leader Sheik Salach Shehadeh in which sixteen Palestinians were killed. An in-depth reading of the six news broadcasts provides important insights into how journalists' routines ensure a steady flow of culturally acceptable news stories that reinforce hatred between enemies."

The functionalist theoretical context of role conception, it is argued, creates two complications or tensions: 1) a tension between the individual and the institutional and 2) the conscious and the unconscious. The central problem is that role conception has been operationalized at the individual level of analysis. Using dramaturgical theory the paper argues that journalistic role conception should be reconceptualized and that the predominant research strategy on journalistic role conceptions should be altered. Role conception should be operationalized at an institutional level of analysis."
2005-0854,Journalists and their Sources: Lessons from Anthropology,Reporters and Their Sources: Ties That Bind?,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Journalists and their Sources: Lessons from Anthropology,Reporters and Their Sources: Ties That Bind?,"This paper challenges journalists relationship with their sources by comparing it with the relationship between anthropologists and their informants. While anthropology and journalism use similar methods and, many times, produce a similar kind of knowledge, the two professions have significantly different views of their sources. Like all social sciences, anthropology is subject to the federal regulation for research with human subjects. This regulation requires the assessment of costs and benefits, the informed consent of informants, and, in general, researchers protective and responsible attitude towards them. Citing the First Amendments and arguing that news is non-generalizable knowledge, journalism exempts itself from this regulation. This paper shows that both arguments for exemption are unsustainable and analyzes three other possible incompatibilities between journalism and the federal regulation: the watchdog role of the press, the apparent conflict between confidentiality and credibility, and journalists reluctance to take responsibility for the consequences of what they publish. It concludes that news professionals understanding of truth in terms of facticity and of their job as the mere transmission of such truths impairs their sense of ethical responsibility."

Whereas there have been numerous studies of news media coverage of polls and public opinion, there has been almost no reported systematic research on journalists' opinions about public opinion and civic journalism. The purpose of this paper is to present some of the findings from these studies and to compare them across time and place where possible. In doing so, this paper hopes to add to our understanding of what journalists think about public opinion and civic journalism more generally and whether these views have changed much since the early 1980s."

vehicle for unobtrusively reinforcing the Bush administrations interpretive framework of the
9/11 events. The basis for this argument subsists in the numerous intertextual references to the
movie that appeared in mainstream media sources from the outset of the tragedy. Following
Kellners (1995) concept of ideological critique, I first examine the narrative of Independence
Day through a comparison with Fight Club. Both movies portray analogous scenes of crumbling
towers but in two different ideological contexts, which the comparison intends to highlight.
Second, I examine the ideological subtext of Independence Day with those of two key speeches
given by president Bush. This second diagnostic comparison offers evidence that similar
ideologies underlie the narrative in Independence Day and Bushs speeches. I argue, therefore,
that the intertextual references between Independence Day and the World Trade Center tragedy
were functional in activating and promoting the hegemonic ascent of an interpretive framework
that is consistent with the one proposed by the Bush administration."

Sixty of the top selling video games across three of the most popular consoles (Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation2, and Nintendo GameCube) were content analyzed. A total of 489 characters with an identifiable sex were used for analyses. Female characters (n=70) were underrepresented in comparison to their male counterparts (n=419). In comparison to male characters, females were significantly more likely to be partially nude, featured with an unrealistic body image and shown wearing sexually revealing clothing and inappropriate attire. Implications for these findings are discussed using Social Cognitive Theory as a theoretical anchor."

While majority of studies that claim to test the knowledge gap hypothesis tests it in an appropriate way, some have used inadequate ways of testing. Most of these inadequate tests are one-shot studies, which completely ignored the role of mass media in this education-knowledge relationship. A standard for testing the knowledge gap hypothesis was set based on a relatively thorough review of knowledge gap literature. All the relevant studies were compared against the standard to be classified into appropriate and inadequate test categories. Studies with appropriate tests of knowledge gap hypothesis are evaluated and evidence for knowledge gap development is synthesized along several dimensions. Three theoretical frameworks, two research designs and various conceptualizations of knowledge used by different researchers were shown to contribute to the inconsistency of findings on knowledge gap hypothesis."
2005-0861,Language Alternation as a Resource for Identity Negotiations among Dominican Americans,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,Language & Social Interaction,,,Paper,Language Alternation as a Resource for Identity Negotiations among Dominican Americans,Top Three Papers in Language and Social Interaction,"This paper argues that code switching among Dominican American high school students can serve multiple functions, and that switching as a practice always has multiple social meanings. Like other bilingual children of international labor migrants, Dominican Americans straddle linguistic and sociocultural worlds, and their language alternation in intra-group peer interaction is emblematic of this straddling. Their form of frequent, unmarked switching--code switching as a discourse mode--is distinct from other ways of speaking in their communities and the wider society, and, as such, constitutes a style. The meanings that one attributes to this style are largely a function of ones subject position. For members, such language alternation is an unmarked way of speaking and doing the things that high school student do with talk: gossip, flirt, tease, make social plans, ask about schoolwork, etc. Non-members often evaluate this style of speaking in very different terms that are tied to Western ideologies of linguistic purism and a unity of language, race, and nation. Frequent code switching is seen by many monolinguals as a sign of linguistic and cognitive deficiency, by nativist groups as a rejection of incorporation into US society, and by many academics as a sophisticated, agentive, and strategic way of negotiating social and political structures and meanings."

From a social-psychological perspective, researchers have found that, although Chinese people prefer avoiding and integrating conflict styles, this kind of non-confrontational style is negatively related with joint problem solving approach in negotiations. From a symbolic perspective, researchers have noted that Chinese people have a different meaning system for negotiation and its associated activities from their western counterparts. Research from each perspective is reviewed and evaluated. Although both perspectives have provided insightful explanation about Chinese negotiation behaviors, many important questions remain unanswered; consequently, three research questions are proposed for future investigation."

Reality television shows in the Arab world tend to be pan-Arab rather than national in reach. The article analyzes the roles those shows are playing in the changing landscape of Arab society. The article discusses the framing of the programs and how that relates to their acceptability or otherwise in various Arab countries. In turn, this issue raises questions about cultural hybridity as well as cultural leadership. Lebanon in particular is constructed by Star Academy as a cultural leader providing a link between the Arab world and the West. This is reflected in the use of language in the show, where Arabic is speckled with French, yet where, at the same time, the shows presenter and teachers boast about succeeding in teaching the contestants to sing in all Arabic dialects and accents. The article teases out the contradictions inherent in language use in the show, and relates that to issues of community and nationalism. On one hand, Star Academy seems to be bringing the Arab world together. Yet on the other hand, this is far from a mere nostalgic view on pan-Arab nationalism; rather, Star Academy is a symptom"

Results indicated a significant amount of money spent on issue ads (over $105 million). There was a deep concentration of sponsors, with most of the money coming from a few organizations. Television advertising was more concentrated than print. Business interests out spent non-profit interests. An examination of specific issues receiving the most spending (national energy policy and prescription drugs) indicated that spending was inequitable with most money being spent for advertising on a single side of an issue."

This study also utilizes one aspect of the acculturation process, linguistic acculturation, to determine if acculturation acts as a critical variable in the relationship between Spanish language media preference and ethnic identity. Results suggest that, while Anglo-identity and American-identity do not predict respondents preference to media language, identity with Mexicans or with (Mexican)-Americans showed strikingly different and consistent patterns of media language preference. Respondents who are identified with Mexicans prefer Spanish language programming and content, while those identified with (Mexican)-Americans prefer English language programming and content."

This paper examines news magazine coverage of Latinos and shows how race and ethnicity are not easy containers for the diverse group of 38 million people who claim common ancestry to Latin America and the Caribbean. An examination of two cover stories from the late 1990s suggests the incorporation of multiculturalism as a form of professional bias in news magazine feature stories."

This study found that a composite week of primetime programming on ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, UPN and the WB yielded 4,347 commercial messages (either commercials for products/services or movie trailers/television program promotions), of which 539 (12.33%) contained some form of aggression (physical, verbal, or fortuitous). Those 539 commercial or promotional messages containing aggression then formed the sample used in this content analysis in order to describe the types of aggression shown and determine the role of humor in the commercials. Among the key findings: Just over half (53.5%) of all commercials featuring aggression also contained an element of humor. Humor was more common when the aggression was fortuitousa category that included accidents and run-ins with objectsthan when it was physical and intentional. An application of the three major types of humor advanced by humor theorists shows physical comedy/psychoanalytic humor was the most frequently employed technique in the sample, followed by surprise/incongruity, and derision/superiority. Overall, this study addresses a gap in the literature and discovers an association between aggression and humor in commercial content that may contribute to desensitization to violence in audience members."

Using very different populations and data elicitation procedures, perceptions of police officers accommodative behaviors were consistently found to be a major predictor of ratings of law enforcement, much more so than the socio-demographic variables so prominently featured in previous studies. The literature on intergroup communication, while focusing on interactions between an array of contrastive social categories, has yet to address law enforcement-civilian encounters. This paper seeks to fill that void empirically. The findings extend communication accommodation theory into a new social arena of intergroup communication and critical applications to law enforcement training, practice, and policies are focally addressed."

The multilevel model of high-performance suggestion systems proposed in this paper integrates factors that directly influence workers participation in the suggestion system (such as personal traits, self-efficacy and rewards) with broader factors (such as job characteristics, job satisfaction, trust, commitment) that satisfy specific pre-conditions for fostering workers willingness and ability to improve the organizational performance with their discretionary effort.
This model promises to provide relevant knowledge regarding the maintenance and creation of effective suggestion systems that are able to untap workers creativity. Also, this research offers insights and a systematic assessment of the way companies can adequately take advantage of the benefits lean production (productivity increases, quality products, and enhanced efficiencies) with the collaboration of their workforce."

This paper compared approaches to survey measurement of incidental exposure to mass media relevant to cancer communication. We compared the performance of several classes of exposure questions against a criterion cancer knowledge scale, while considering trade-offs between nomological validity, face validity, and respondent burden.
A telephone survey was carried out in July-August 2004 with a national RDD sample of 800 respondents aged 18 and over. Classes of questions included: general media exposure, exposure to media that carry health content, attention to health topics, quantity of exposure to health topics, specific cancer-related exposure about prevention, diet, exercise, and open-ended measures tapping recall of prevention information.
Hierarchical regression analyses tested the predictive power of each of the exposure measures over and above education, gender, and age to predict cancer knowledge. General media exposure questions were not associated with cancer knowledge, although they were predictors of knowledge about non-cancer health issues salient in the media. Health media exposure questions added 3.7% variance above and beyond education, gender, and age. Closed-ended questions about cancer prevention added 6.7% of variance above and beyond education, gender, and age. They also added 5.2% of unique variance above and beyond general and health media questions. Attention to health topics (3.1 %) and open-ended prevention (9.9 %) measures yielded even greater predictive power than the other exposure measures. Both measures may be confounded with issue involvement and with knowledge, respectively, and thus may not be measuring media exposure alone."

We wanted to know if very young children who are in the early stages of language acquisition learn vocabulary quickly (fast map) from programs such as Teletubbies. Using a fast mapping paradigm, this study examined a group (n= 48) of toddlers (15-24 months) and their ability to learn novel words. Utilizing a repeated measures design, we compared childrens ability to learn various novel words in 5 different conditions. These included the presentation and identification of a novel word by: an adult speaker via live presentation when the toddler was attending (i.e., joint reference), an adult via live presentation when the toddler was not attending, an adult speaker on television, and via an edited clip from Teletubbies. Overall, the toddlers were most successful in learning novel words in a joint reference condition. They were significantly less successful in the teletubbies condition. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between age and condition on childrens performance. Both younger (15-21 months) and older (22-24 months) toddlers identified the target objects when they received the information from an adult speaker; however, it appeared that children under the age of 22 months did not identify the target item when they received the information from Teletubbies."

A context of stem cell and the cloning debate is used to test the relationships. Two surveys and a content analysis show that the legitimacy of sources perceived by journalists has an impact on the regularity and valence of those sources media coverage, whereas public relations expertise of sources does not have an impact on any of the media access indicators.

However, there is little research on the variety of influence strategies people use to change health behaviors, as well on the conditions under which these strategies emerge. This study examines how various constructs, such as having the right to confront the other, a communal orientation towards relationships and psychological reactance influence the strategies people use when confronting another. We found that having a right to confront was associated with an increased use of active and direct strategies, indirect strategies, offers of support as well as punitive strategies. Having a communal orientation towards relationships was also related to use of strategies. Legitimacy and communal orientation did not interact to predict strategy use. However, legitimacy did interact with psychological reactance to predict two of the strategies that were measured."

Thus, I begin by discussing the film as what is not the American Dreamthat is, the racialized and marginalized reality of Southall, west London of Bend it Like Beckhamthat is used to foreground the possibilities of the promised land. What is not highlights not only the politics of assimilation but also the contentious relationships between the (British) empire and the subject. Through out the film, America is the goal. The intricate political travels of the Bhamra family to Britain via Kenya, and the significance of this multiple border crossing remain secondary. Instead, by focusing on the racial tensions of England as the before, Bend it like Beckham perpetuates the myth of the American melting pot as the after. This after, I later discuss in What is: the history and contemporary reality of the South Asian diaspora in the United States preceding and following the release of the film. These histories and contemporary realties, shaped by Americas racial and class relationships, as well as the events of September 11th, stand in stark contrast to the utopian possibilities that the film espouses. I conclude by pulling all these strands together to understand why America so loved Bend it Like Beckham ."

Lexical borrowing as part of nativization has rarely been investigated. This paper presents a data-based analysis of 59 borrowed lexical items as found in 84 articles from two English newspapers in China, including both loanwords and loan translations. On the whole these items do not seem to be in widespread use. Additionally, the findings show that the loanwords tend to be culture-specific lexical items, nonce borrowings, and necessary borrowings. The loan translations may be more foreign than they appear, because of the underlying facets of Chinese culture. Also discussed in the paper are two linguistic factors that may decide if a lexical item may be borrowed as a loanword or a loan translation, as well as the existence of pairs and sets of synonymous loanwords and/or loan translations, found among Chinese-English bilingual communities in and outside China."

A series of highly mediated events over the past 15 years  the O. J. Simpson murder trial, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the death of Princess Diana and the aftermath of September 11, 2001  led segments of the mainstream media to question, with varying degrees of aggressiveness, their own professional activities. Generally speaking, however, these moments of self-reflexivity  leading to the occasional journalistic mea culpa  tend to be scattershot in nature, and not part of a broader, structured effort on the part of mainstream media workers to engage in what Lule (1992) called, the rarest kind of criticism: criticism of the press by the press in the press (92). An exception to the random, unstructured critique of the press is the program Reliable Sources, aired weekly over the past decade on CNN. For this paper, and using Gramscis (1971) theory of hegemony as a framework, I examined the transcripts of 56 episodes of RS (aired between January 2003 and March 2004) in order to illustrate how RS, while appearing to offer a forum for a critical examination of the U.S. mainstream press, actually avoids addressing the structural problems inherent in the U.S. news media and, in addition, marginalizes alternative or progressive critiques of the socio-political status quo."

Unlike past studies that treated support for censorship as the main consequence of the third-person effect, our study is the first to examine the direct political implications of the process. A judgment task experiment of 340 individuals who were shown four ads from the 2004 Bush/Kerry campaigns yielded support for both the perceptual and behavioral hypotheses. The authors present paternalism as a theoretical rational for this occurrence. If individuals feel that others who are less knowledgeable or politically sophisticated than they are, might be more likely to be persuaded by political advertising, they in turn would attempt to compensate for others perceived ignorance by taking political action such as voting."
2005-0879,Limits and Possibilities of Passive Methods for Measuring the Web Audience,Research Methodology for Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Limits and Possibilities of Passive Methods for Measuring the Web Audience,Research Methodology for Communication and Technology,"The audience has traditionally been an essential concept in communication theory and a privileged object of study in communication research. When studying mass communication media, the reality of the audience is always elusive and, for the most part, only manifested through research. Even though the audience can be researched in many different ways, from an institutional and economic point of view the way in which the audience achieves reality has been reduced, for the most part, to issues of measurement. If we assume that the idea of the audience needs to be reassessed as new communication realities take shape, then we necessarily need to refer to the audience of the internet and the web. And if the media audience achieves reality through research and, in particular, through measurement, an analysis of the ways in which the audience of the new media is measured seems particularly necessary. This paper focuses on the audience measurement methods most indigenous to the web, that is, the ones that take advantage of the information stored in computers about the communication exchanges in which those computers participate. The paper places these methods, referred to as passive methods, within a comprehensive classification of web audience measurement methods. It then proceeds to an analysis of the most relevant passive methods website log-files analysis, ad server log-files analysis, and tag-generated log-files analysis that shows how these methods present some fundamental limitations when used as an audience measurement tool."

In response to this increasing health crisis and given the lack of understanding of interpersonal factors that contribute to this crisis, an in-depth qualitative study was conducted investigating communication about sex in the relationships of 42 Puerto Rican men and women ranging in age from 18 to 56. Gender emerged as a significant guide to communication about sex, comprising three main themes: the influence of machismo, the role of virginity, and messages received about sex. It became clear that safer sex, from a relational standpoint, is difficult to negotiate in Puerto Rico for both men and women."

Since neither political science nor mass communication have demonstrated a serious interest in lobbying, the little bit of research available has come from the field of public relations. Although recent research (Koeppl, 2000; Terry, 2001a; Terry, 2001b) has provided greater insight to the communicative practices of lobbyists, a large gap in the literature on lobbying as a specialized form of public relations still remains. This case study is an interpretive analysis that uses an ethnographic approach to further understand the culture of lobbying. Qualitative research methods were applied to address questions about the communicative practices and performative acts of lobbyists. Although admittedly limited, preliminary findings confirm Pearsons (1989) claim of public relations as the management of interpersonal dialogue, Terrys (2001a, 2001b) assertion of lobbying as a form of interpersonal rhetorical communication, and contributes to the development of a dialogic theory of public relations."

I argue that discursive construction and other political, institutional, and cultural factors are not less crucial than mere economic relations for middle-class formation in South Korea.
Middle-class formation in South Korea cannot be understood apart from the presence and features of the state. Since the bourgeoisie has more or less coexisted peacefully with authoritarian governments in Korea, and it has never had a compelling material incentive to promote democratic politics, we should bear in mind an alternative hypothesis that different national and local contexts are crucial and determining factors for structural changes in political and economic arena in an era of globalization. Hence, my aim was to explore different historical formation of class in conjunction with the state, in an empirical context, in this case South Korean."

After a comprehensive literature review, 4 hypotheses are proposed on loneliness, social interaction and parasocial interaction, and perceived reality. The survey method is used, and all of the measurements (except for social interaction) in the questionnaire have been reliably used in a wide range of social science research. Our results suggest that loneliness and parasocial interaction are not associated with the discrepancy between sociability and social interaction. The extent of loneliness exerts no influence on the association between social and parasocial interaction. Perceived reality is positively correlated with parasocial interaction."

Cognitive and Affective Reactions to OTF Objects,Web Advertising and Pop-Up Ads,"With the increased use of rich media on the Web, different online object formats have started to pose important questions regarding the connection between message effectiveness and novelty effects. Among these formats, 3D outside-the-frame (OTF) objects embedded within web page content present an interesting challenge for research, as they are novel and complex versions of interactive 3D animated product presentations. The present paper provides evidence gathered on the cognitive and affective effects of OTF objects. The results show that movies featuring OTF presentations are considered less boring than others, due to a novelty effect. However, the impact of OTF objects on perceptions, attitudes, and memory seems to be moderated by the type of object and also the type of movement the object makes. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed."

The blog was used less for dissent and more for candidate support, and most blog postings lacked reason-giving. Engagement with dissenting opinion depended on the source of the blog post: dissenting opinion from nonsupporters was more likely to be dismissed when compared to dissenting opinion from supporters. Supporter deliberation was determined by source credibility, and nonsupporters were not viewed as trusted sources. Nonsupporters were acutely aware of their minority status and tended to post dissenting opinion that lacked substantive content. Though the Dean headquarters tried to block dissent in the design of the blog, survival of disagreement was evident in the appearance of positive comments about other candidates and continued dissent from supporters. Most importantly, media content cited on the blog framed discourse periodically and provided the needed diversity of opinion that political conversation did not permit."

This paper presents an historical analysis of advertisements appearing between 1970 and 2003 in the womens magazines Cosmopolitan and Glamour. The resulting archive illustrates the relationship between the rise in feminism, poststructuralism, and niche marketing and media representations of gender identity. More particularly, by articulating and employing the theory of identity dissonance, the author wishes to demonstrate how media not only influence, but embody American societys either-or/dichotomous approach to identity management and self-construction. Identity dissonance occurs when an individual regards particular identities as essential components of his or her self-concept yet also recognizes, consciously or unconsciously, that these identities oppose each other. This papers findings point to a growing recognition, and manipulation of gender identity dissonance by the advertising industry, as it attempts to both appeal to, and capitalize upon, womens psychological and sociological experiences.

For them to do this role, they utilize and incorporate various media symbolism into their theological viewpoints in order to reinforce their congregations about their ontological and epistemological position. In this process, identity as a religious community is expressed in forms of rhetoric and discourse. Childrens movies like Harry Potter and Spirited Away provide good examples of the media symbolism for evangelical Christian communities to express, discuss, and distribute their own way to deal with popular culture. Reviews of these movies by evangelical Christian communities help us to understand the perceptions and assumptions about children, parents, popular culture, and the role of religion in the childrens interaction with the media. From the analysis of the film reviews, this study identified six themes that these communities make use of when they evaluate and critique popular cultural products for children: (1) Children, parents, and development; (2) Fantasy vs. reality; (3) Plot line of good vs. evil; (4) Childrens media as parable for moral and religious values; (5) Doomed popular culture and entertainment; (6) The Bible and faith: preparing the warfare."

The murder immediately became a major media-event and was presented as a murder of honour. It induced a lively debate about how it was possible for a parent to kill his child. In order to make sense of the killing actors drew on different discourses such as immigration policies, failed integration, marginalisation, racism, feminism and dysfunctional families. In this public conversation Fadime Sahindal was constructed as a heroine and martyr, who died for her love of freedom and independence. The funeral was broadcasted live and was attended, together with thousands of others, by the crown princess, the speaker of the parliament, and the minister of integration. The paper describes how the media discourse played a part in making sense of what appeared as a senseless murder of honour. Salient in this discourse was the construction of them in opposition to us, a process in which cultural differences, stereotypes, notions of distant times and places, played an important part. Besides pointing to the racist character of this discourse, salient traits in the discourse are deconstructed in order to discuss how other notions and norms, such as notions concerning gender, family and class follow and are affirmed in and through the construction of the dichotomy between the alien other and the familiar Swedish."

We then analyze linkages among these blogs to see whether people of different political persuasions participate in any idea exchange online.

ABSTRACT
This paper will focus on Peruvian television comedy shows that sprout out beginning in 1998 four years after the arrival of cable TV to the country. The comedy shows I will be discussing here were transplanted from the streets and plazas of Lima (the capital of Peru) onto television, creating an interesting inter-textuality and raising questions of race, culture, gender, and class in Peruvian society. On looking at this transference from the streets to television this paper will answer, first, what is the meaning of ""popular culture"" in the Peruvian context; and second, what is the social and economic meaning of the inter-textuality between street skits and television comedy shows. The paper will also address how television has become a site for the ""popular"" to gain a voice while at the same time it perpetuates local hegemonic views of race, gender, class and culture."

Similar to existing scholarship in more established democracies such as the United States, I use the 2001 Afrobarometer survey conducted in Mali to quantitatively examine how mass media use in a developing democracy is associated with higher levels of individual political knowledge, participation, and socialization. Secondly, I theorize that mass media use in a developing democracy with high levels of social stratification and hierarchy may also promote knowledge and communication gaps among the populace. However, in contrast to the literature on knowledge gaps developed in more established democracies, I argue that these gaps may result in normatively positive outcomes by reinforcing existing power relations and overall system maintenance that allow for manageable democratic transition and consolidation. My results suggest that television and newspaper use are associated with political knowledge and participation, but radio use is not. Though radio use is positively associated with democratic socialization while newspaper use is not. Furthermore, I also find significant communication gaps associated with various forms of media use and education, ethnic, gender, and geographic stratifications within Malian society."

Creative individuals are taking advantage of older and newer communication technologies and using them in ways that bridge the divide separating the study of interpersonal communication and of mass communication. The term masspersonal is proposed to encompasses instances when (a) individuals use traditionally mass communication channels for interpersonal communication, (b) individuals use traditionally interpersonal communication channels for mass communication, and (c) individuals use older and newer channels to generate mass communication and interpersonal communication simultaneously. This user-centered perspective highlights the need to unhitch the channel of communication from conceptualizations of mass and interpersonal communication. An analysis of masspersonal communication suggests two dimensions  personalization and message access exclusivity  that provide a clearer understanding of the differences and commonalties of interpersonal communication, mass communication and masspersonal communication. Topics of inquiry requiring attention from both interpersonal and mass communication scholars are identified."

Like her famous colleague Margaret Bourke-White, Mieth was a talented and prolific photographer for Life from the 1930s through the fifties. Unlike Bourke-White, however, Mieth did not survive postwar red-baiting. After refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1950, Mieths Life assignments dwindled and she gradually withdrew from commercial photography. Despite her important contributions to photojournalism and to modern discourse about representation, Mieth has virtually been ignored by media scholars. This paper examines Mieths photography, focusing on her best-known single photograph: a 1939 portrait of a glowering rhesus monkey held captive by scientists in a Puerto Rico monkey colony. This image is worth analyzing as a photographic icon that was extremely popular with Lifes readers when it first appeared. It was subsequently reprinted in the magazine and in commemorative books. The monkey image continues to resonate with viewers, as demonstrated by audience response to its appearance in the documentary Hansel Mieth: Vagabond Photographer (Nancy Schiesari, 2003). Finally, the image is worth examining because the evolution of its meaning parallels the trajectory of Mieths professional career. The photograph was created as part of a scientific article, but its meaning was trivialized by Life editors, who turned it into a novelty photograph called ""The Misogynist."" Similarly, Mieths status as a serious photojournalist shifted during and after World War II, when her assignments became increasingly trivial and then disappeared altogether."
2005-0918,Measuring Community Change as Social Choice,The Importance of Place and Community in Development,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Measuring Community Change as Social Choice,The Importance of Place and Community in Development,"Development communication projects are historically studied using the individual as the unit of analysis. Recently, calls have become common for community based approaches that focus on units of change and analysis that are collective. This study explores an approach to the problem of treating change at the collective level based in social choice theory developed in political science. Social choice measures are constructed by aggregating citizens candidate preference rankings. However, the method of aggregation produces, rather than a summary distribution measure, a measure that under certain conditions reflects the dimensionality underlying preference rankings. The paper introduces the key concepts of social choice theory and preference structuration, and argues their relevance for development communication. It also reports an exploratory empirical study conducted to generate structuration data and test discourse effects on these data in a health setting. A conclusion summarizes results and discusses possible next steps for related inquiry."

This paper proposes an empirical measure for assessing the political bias of any publication in which enduring social issues are analyzed. Using the measure in a content analysis of two of America's leading, explicitly partisan journals, the conservative National Review and the liberal Progressive covering a 25 year period, this study also aims at providing comparative standards for assessing partisanship in future studies of putatively non-biased publications. Analysis focuses on media uses of information sources and on the process by which media define issues in terms of their social costs, causes and possible solutions."

This study looks at 2003 media coverage of the topic, focusing on the ways in which this coverage depicted the issue in political terms. By assessing the attributes, actors and orientations present in such coverage, this study provides a refinement of broad framing studies, particularly those looking at strategic frames. The results suggest same-sex marriage was frequently cast in political terms, and that stories tended to use political attributes and actors in conjunction with one another; both were associated with a negative orientation toward same-sex unions."

Finland has traditionally had a large welfare system, though presently public organizations are under pressure to legitimize their functions, become more efficient and profitable. In order for an organization to survive and legitimize its functions, cooperation with the environment is required. This legitimization is achieved through a dialogue between the organization and its stakeholders. To prove their importance, public organizations are to measure their performance yet suitable measurement instruments are scarce, as the nature of public services is hard to measure. However, stakeholder assessments are measurable, and this paper examines the stakeholder assessments of Finnish public organizations through a survey of frequent stakeholders. The paper reports the building of a stakeholder questionnaire for public organizations and the reputational factors of public organizations presented through Head-model."
2005-0922,Media and Communications Technologies as Time-Space Bridges for Perception and Knowing,New Media,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Media and Communications Technologies as Time-Space Bridges for Perception and Knowing,New Media,"The perception of mediated information takes place in the subjective here-and-now situation of the perceiver within the natural sensory envelope. The content of information can however contain descriptions of far away places or other times. The information can also be fictional, a product of an author´s imagination. Consequently, media and communications technologies can be considered as time-space bridges for perception and knowing of the state of the external world. The role of the perceiver´s mental models in these perceptual shifts is essential. Also, the concept of presence, i.e. the illusion of non-mediation is a key element of broadened perception through technology This article will draft an approach to media as time-space bridges of perception from the point of view of a single perceiver."
2005-0923,Media Change through Bounded Innovations: Journalism in China's Media Reforms,Emerging Issues in Chinese Media,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Media Change through Bounded Innovations: Journalism in China's Media Reforms,Emerging Issues in Chinese Media,"This paper examines media change in contemporary China, focusing primarily on journalists and journalistic work. Taking a critical institutionalist perspective, it argues that Chinas media change in the reforms involves a dialectic relationship between the status quo and innovations. Significant changes are being devised to preserve the basic Party-press principles in a market economy. In this process, journalistic practitioners improvise innovative practices, inspired by both the market and professional media exemplars, while the party-state authority selects and co-opts such practices and stabilizes them into institutional rules or sustained routine practices. This dynamic process represents a mode of institutional change in a transitional society where the state remains in a firm control and change takes place. It leads to political uncertainties and bounded innovations in media change. The ongoing changes, consequently, show no immediate sign on or direct pressure toward democratization of the state, while at the same time, fostering opportunities for the expansion of the society without sustaining any true democratic impulse in it."

It is possible that program context may influence perceived reality of various womens body types. Two experiments found that while the body type of an actress had little effect in a domestic setting, larger women were perceived as less realistic and less likely to get a television role if the program was in a professional setting. The results have implications for both how audiences judge body types and for how audiences make realism judgments."

These new structures are expected to affect the medias coverage of women and womens issues. An examination of the media in the pre- and post-Kufuor election period revealed that coverage of women has not changed. However, findings indicate that the media is creating a class structure with its coverage of women within the various social classes."
2005-0952,Media Credibility: Comparing Internet and Traditional News Sources in South Korea,f Credibility & Community,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Media Credibility: Comparing Internet and Traditional News Sources in South Korea,Issues of Credibility & Community,"Abstract
Based on an online survey, this study examined how Web users in South Korea judge traditional news media, their online counterparts and independent Web newspapers for political information, as well as explored which factors influence credibility of online sources during the 2004 national assembly election. The results revealed that the politically-interested Internet users relied more on Independent Web-based newspapers for political information and judged them as the most credible. Reliance on traditional and online sources are stronger predictors of the credibility for online media sources. None of demographic variables significantly predicted credibility of online sources, but some political variables such as campaign interest, political involvement, and likelihood of voting turned out to be significant predictors. Cultural variables predicted only online newspapers credibility. In a discussion section, authors presented some explanations for this studys findings considering the political impact of the Internet on campaign activity during the election."

While most media dependency research has examined dependency relations under circumstances when information was readily available, this study looks at a situation in which information was highly controlled and thus was not easily available from the mainstream media. As the socio-structural environment was not conducive to the free flow of information during a major public health crisis, audience members not only actively engaged in information seeking from alternative resources, but they were also involved in creating alternative information channels by being information producers and disseminators. The Internet was a particularly empowering tool to allow individuals to bypass official control and to challenge official claims during the crisis."

In contrast to manual workers in an industrial society, every knowledge workers needs to strive to become a specialist with high creativity, outstanding information technology skills, an independent and critical mind, team spirit and a great enthusiasm for learning. To meet the challenge of the new millennium, many countries are undergoing a structural change to transform themselves from industrial societies to a knowledge societies. They are eager to reform their educational systems. This paper takes Hong Kong as a target of investigation. In Hong Kong an educational reform is underway, highlighting the importance of cultivating future knowledge workers. Meanwhile, media education is also getting momentum in Hong Kong. This paper aims at examining how media education can contribute to the nurturing of young leaders and help them become competent knowledge workers in a knowledge society. The analysis is based on the media education projects conducted in Hong Kong."

Using Lulls social use of television typology (1990), this research identifies the pattern of rural chinese's viewing behaviors on the Spring Festival Eve, and investigates how they make use of the media event for festival celebrations. The research is based on a field study performed in a small village in southern China during 2004 Spring Festival period. Ethnographic interviews and diaries are used to collect data for analysis. It finds that rural Chinese use the media event mainly for its structural function, using it as background noise, companion, as well as a regulator of celebration activities. It also finds that the televised Gala provokes a passive mode of viewing, which is opposite to the results of previous research on media event."

Risk judgments including perceived severity, prevalence, controllability, familiarity, and concern about alcohol-related injuries comprise the outcome measures. Alcohol-related injuries include assaults, motor vehicle crashes, and other injury incidents such as falls, fire, and drowning. Results support the hypotheses of partial mediation with respect to most risk judgment factors. In particular, effects of education, gender, sensation-seeking, and prior first- or second-hand experience with alcohol-related mishaps on judgments of concern and/or severity are partially mediated by media variables. The authors conclude that media effects on health risk judgments can be usefully understood as part of a larger social process in which media are selectively attended to due to exogenous influences; part of the effect of these exogenous influences on these risk judgments is via these media influences. Media use variables also retain a degree of influence after controlling for these exogenous factors."

It was hypothesized that media exposure would be positively related to romanticism which would, in turn, be positively related to repeated communicative attempts to win the heart of a reluctant love interest. Participants (N = 236) completed an unrequited love questionnaire, a romanticism measure, and a media exposure measure. Correlational analyses revealed that media exposure was related to three dimensions of romanticism as well as to persistence. In addition, the belief that true love finds a way was positively related to persistence for participants who had attempted to persuade their love interest to go out with them. The findings suggest that the link between media exposure and persistence may be stronger than the link between romanticism and persistence. Avenues for future research are suggested."

Using Goffmans theory of stigma and media frames, the present analysis examines 71 news stories pertaining to adoption that appeared in major broadcast networks between 2001and 2003. Results indicate that while a significant percentage of stories contain stigmatizing portrayals of the individuals involved in the adoption process, depictions of the adoptive family and the communication within it were overwhelmingly positive. Further, the inclusion of issues surrounding the social context of adoption (e.g., teen pregnancy, abuse/neglect) and systematic variation in the appearance of economic and responsibility frames indicate that these stories are attempting to show a more balance view of adoption."

I synthesize three theoretical frameworks: 1) the effect of international trade on political alignment, 2) the media framing of social movements, and 3) a model of ideological diffusion. Agendas of both the WTO and the protestors are compared using a content analysis of 419 articles of the US metropolitan newspapers. The study discovers that the media pushed forward the agenda of the WTO before the protest; however shifted its agenda to the agendas of the protestors. Some concerns of the protestor were illegitimatized due to the ambiguities surrounding the issues."

It explores normative theories and empirical results, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and offers new approaches and a framework for future research. The analysis views international conflict as a process moving through four phases characterized by a particular condition and goal: prevention, management, resolution, and reconciliation. The paper investigates actual and potential media intervention in each phase and offers a proposal for a new framework for analysis based on the integration of conflict theories and the functional theory of communication."

The signs are not new, but the relationship between written text and visual representation is changing in reaction to the audiences knowledge of how media is made. We offer a syntactic critique of how print advertisements work to create meaning for the media literate. This analysis reads texts for underlying cultural and ideological meanings and the anticipation of what subjects might already know about media creation. New conceptual tools are needed to chart these re-combinations of visual and textual signs and codes, specifically, sign paths, meaning momentum, conduits, stylization."
2005-0964,Media Message Flows and Interpersonal Communication: The Conditional Nature of Effects on Public Opinion,Extending Media Effects Theories,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Media Message Flows and Interpersonal Communication: The Conditional Nature of Effects on Public Opinion,Extending Media Effects Theories,"This study investigates the differential effects of exposure and attention to news and of interpersonal communication on change in public opinion under the condition of one-sided or two-sided information flows. Based on Zallers theory of public opinion dynamics, for less politically sophisticated individuals we expected media to influence changes in opinion under the condition of a one-sided message flow. We also expected politically sophisticated individuals to rely more on cues for opinion change stemming from interpersonal communication. The study draws on two-wave panel surveys and media content analyses of television news and national newspapers. The results confirmed our hypotheses and showed media effects for less politically sophisticated individuals under the condition of a one-sided message flow and effects of interpersonal communication for politically sophisticated individuals. Media had no effects under the condition of a two-sided message flow. The study concludes with a discussion of the conditionality of media effects and the moderating role of political sophistication."

This study used media portrayal of women as an index to explore the relationship between media and society within the Chinese context. Through a content analysis of 352 cover pictures of Women of China, Chinas official English women magazine for foreign publicity, we investigated whether and how the media portrayal of Chinese women relates to the social changes in China under an authoritative communication and political system. Our findings show that the image of Chinese women presented by the covers of Women of China was to a large extent influenced by the socio-economic and political-ideological changes in China. Rather than a literal portrayal of the reality, it is a symbolic representation of the Chinese women created through the interaction of party ideology, editorial policy and readers taste as well as the changing reality of Chinese womens life and work"

Its main goal is to analyze the role that the national press plays in constructing the periphery as the other in public consciousness. Our analysis demonstrates how the press makes use of diverse strategies, all leading to the construction of peripheral locations as unimportant, marginal or negligible, and all characterized by events, customs, culture, norms and behavior patterns different from those characteristic of the center. We will show how the national press defines who is included within the center boundaries, who is not, and how the press distinguishes between the center and the periphery. In addition, we analyzed changes in the coverage patterns over the years."

Furthermore, very little research has been undertaken regarding the relationships among and between media content, public opinion, and governmental foreign policy. This study presents an original exploratory and comprehensive model of press–public–foreign-policy relations in times of crisis, combining theories of mass communications and international relations, with emphasis on the various stages of the crisis, the roles of the media, and the different positions adopted by the press and by the public vis-a-vis government foreign policy. The model is then applied it to the U.S. during the Bosnian crisis (1992-1995). Commentary and editorials from the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, news headlines from the Washington Times and USA Today, as well as public opinion surveys were examined. The conclusions point to significant correlations among media content, public opinion and foreign policy, clarifying the varying roles of the press during an international crisis. Overall, the conclusions shed new light on our understanding of these relationships, both in general and during times of crisis."

Of interest were the potential effects of perceived news article reach and slant on estimates of public opinion regarding the two issues. While perceptions of bias in news articles proved to be a robust predictor of opinion judgments, support for an effect of perceived news article reach was mixed. Deconstructing perceived reach into access and exposure assumptions should produce an opinion inference model that is more sensitive to the differing influences of local, national and Internet news."

While Tan and colleagues posit that positive/negative evaluations of minority TV portrayals predict real- world stereotypic responses, ultimately influencing policy decisions, we submit that prototypicality is a better predictor of evaluative responses in this context. Consistent with our predictions, path analytic tests of both models reveal that the prototypicality-based model offers a better fit with the data."

The state-initiated reform process, which started in the late 1990s, nurtures a handful of domestic media giants and deregulates the media industry by opening the latter up to outside capital. As a result, Chinese television has more incentives and opportunities to commercialize. As part of the strategies invented by television stations and such other forces as private media firms under the pressure to commercialize, entertainment becomes the field where intense battles for advertisers are fought out. The paper argues that the dramatic increase of Chinese television entertainment must be understood as a response to media deregulation and a new round of commercialization carried on by new players  media conglomerates and privately capitalized participants  which are created precisely by the Chinese state in the late 1990s."

An occasionally used but rarely defined term for the phenomenon is media saturation. However, much of the research on changes in the media environment has relied on cross-sectional analyses that fail to describe long-term changes in media consumption. This research takes advantage of the existence of pre-television media use data from one community to demonstrate diachronic changes in media consumption. In two follow-up studies conducted among adults and children in 2000 and 2004, media consumption among adults increased from their childhood average of 3 hours per day in 1959 to 9 hours per day. Among a sample of current schoolchildren, media consumption equaled that of adults. Media use among both schoolchildren and adults was nearly continuous. Three principles of media use are proposed: the ubiquity of mass media devices in the household, the location of media devices, and the constancy of media use. Implications for displacement theory are discussed."
2005-0972,Medias Creating Reality: Construction as a Social Process,Media Representations,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Medias Creating Reality: Construction as a Social Process,Media Representations,"Mass media's function as constructor of reality is a widely researched problem in communications. This research identifies three types of events: genuine events that would happen without any media attention; media events that take on specific characteristics as media coverage is expected; and pseudo events that happen only because media initiates or broadcasts them.
Based on this systematization we examined a pseudo event to identify characteristics and strategies of media's constructing reality. Using the German pre-selection of the Eurovison Song Contest we analyzed several levels of reality and compared them: the reality of involved PR professionals, journalists, media coverage before the event and after, and the actual event as it happened on site and as it was broadcasted.
Our results clearly show strategies of reality construction. Media designs its own reality, then reports about it and thereby again takes effect on itself. All identified levels of reality differ and show distinctive characteristics. After all, not only a media reality, but a material one is created. This construction process is best described as a social process."

I suggest that two notions, ordinary people and community, are key constructs in the processes of mediation that shape the invitation to members of the public, the publics take up of the invitation, and the resultant self-representations. Drawing on Rose, Couldry, Williams, Mayo and others the key question explored in this paper is how far the notions of ordinary people and community operate to control and order peoples representations of themselves, and how far these terms are positive and empowering for those so ascribed. This question is explored with reference to early findings from two case studies, BBC Wales Capture Wales and the Museum of Londons Londons Voices."

Philosophy Professor Hubert L. Dreyfus finds that Merleau-Ponty is describing just what gives us our sense of the world being directly present to us, which in his book On the Internet (2001), is presented in opposition to mediation. This paper argues that all communication is mediated, and must be understood in a socio-cultural perspective. Mediation make dialogue possible. In order to get grip on digital communication, we need a concept of mediation encompassing the body providing means of mediation as well. The paper draws upon writings on mediation in works of Vygotsky and Hegel, as well as referring to Merleau-Ponty and his followers."

Based on a representative survey of Hong Kong citizens, it first examines the phenomenon of looking glass perception, that is, people tend to see others as holding the opinions that they hold. We go on to examine the effects of what we call the majority rule principle in political evaluation - people would more positively evaluate actors in a social debate who adopt the majority position. The third purpose is to analyse if mass and interpersonal communication have any moderating effect on the looking glass and majority rule principle phenomena. In sum, the findings are generally supportive of our hypotheses. In testing the majority rule principle, the Hong Kong public, when evaluating political actors involved in policy debates, are found to have taken both personal opinion as well as perceived majority opinion towards the issue into account. People would rate negatively groups that support policies they oppose. In cases where the groups were actually supporting the majority stance, then citizens would rate the groups relatively positively. However, the influence of personal opinion remains stronger than that of perceived majority opinion. Hence, when a person in the minority perceives a group to be supporting the majority, the negative influence of personal opinion will still outweigh the positive influence of perceived majority opinion. Yet it remains important to recognize that perceived majority opinion is not irrelevant."

Yet, for many Eastern Europeans communism was not a monolithic Evil Empire but their normal way of life. This paper focuses on the narratives of Bulgarian immigrants to the US about experiences that formed the fabric of everyday life in communist Bulgaria. The informants in this study are not political immigrants. They claim to have had average lives in Bulgaria. After 1989, they came to the US in pursuit of educational and career goals. They belong to a generation that came of age in the last years of communist rule in Bulgaria and have a unique perspective on that period. While they do not see themselves as communism survivors, their stories may contribute to the reconstruction of a fuller memory of life under communism  one that is not fixated on political oppression but allows for the mundane to be remembered and told.

The analysis approaches memory and identity as narrative constructions that are constantly renewed, struggled over and adapted to the present context. In exploring this instability, the paper seeks to identify common patterns among the stories told by immigrants, which represent pieces of the collective memory of ordinary life under communism."

As jobs that involve processing of personal data are increasingly outsourced to India, concerns are being raised about the protection of this data. While a large number of studies has been conducted in order to assess peoples attitudes about data privacy and security in the US, Australia, Canada and Europe, little information is available on this topic in India.
The research we present seeks to gain an empiric and exploratory understanding of Indians attitudes about data privacy and security. We study these attitudes by analyzing the mental models that are reflected in interviews which we conducted among Indians. We will report on a methodology for extracting, analyzing and comparing mental models from texts and on the knowledge we gained about the perception of data privacy and security among the subjects. Our results might be of use for supporting the development of privacy-related policies and technologies that are tailored for the Indian environment."

To this end, the Marion Brechner Citizen Access Project (MBCAP) has implemented a project combining social science methodology and traditional legal research techniques. By presenting the methodology, the authors of the paper demonstrate how the combination of social science and legal methodologies can effectively answer questions associated with public access law. The paper should also be useful to legal and media scholars wishing to build upon state law compilations in order to identify the policy and purpose behind state legislative or court strategies. Furthermore, the project methodology may provide direction to scholars searching for ways to approach legal questions involving multiple sources of law and jurisdictions.

Part I of this paper gives an overview of the problem statement. Part II provides background by reviewing the relevant literature. Part III of this article will review the overall objectives of the project and the methodology used to meet those objectives. Part IV will exemplify with results in order to demonstrate how state public records laws are being analyzed in the project. Part V will conclude by demonstrating the practical and academic applications of the project as well as its limitations."

It is defined as news stories about the roles of the news media (including media actors, media practices, media standards, media products, and media organizations) and the roles of the military publicity process (including PR actors, practices, strategies, products and organizations of political public relations and military news management) in mediated conflicts or campaigns. This study shows that journalists use four different frames to describe the role of the news media and of military news management; these frames are called Conduit, Strategy, Personalization, and Accountability. A content analysis of five leading German newspapers revealed a marked increase in metacoverage from the first Iraq war in 1991 to the second in 2003. Journalists tended to write themselves into the story more often and portrayed the news media involvement in increasingly more active terms. Consequences for political communication research are discussed."

From major bookstores to airport kiosks and bookstands, the most recent titles in leadership are marketed as the new and the hottest bestsellers. Waves after waves of books and articles drench the leadership literature landscape. Readers, and writers, seem to never get enough of analyzing and seeking to understand this enticing, yet elusive, concept  leadership.

Recent interest, however, seems to center on the idea of paradoxes, contradictions, and dialectics at leadership level in organizations (Fairhurst, 2000; Barge, 1996). Often leaders are faced with radically opposing alternatives that, sometimes, both seem to be reasonable and necessary. These types of situations are fraught with tensions and dilemmas for the leaders.

In my research I seek to unpack the complexities that leaders are faced with in these types of choice situations between diametrically opposed options (i.e. trust-distrust, competition-cooperation, rational-emotional, dependence-independence, and change-stability). I believe that a dialectics theoretical approach holds much promise for scholars and practitioners in elucidating the way leaders manage tensions in organizational settings in order to benefit the respective organizations and reach its goals. In this essay, to be specific, I look at how charismatic and transformational leaders deal with tensions, contradictions, and dualities at a leader-follower level."

Research shows that all cyberspace words are some kind of lexical extensions of ordinary words and they are made by metaphorical process  mapping between the source and target domains. George Lakoffs Metaphor Theory is used to explain the process of creating new words. For categorization of cyberspace words, Eleanor Roschs Prototype Theory is used. Analysis of data shows that there are eight categories (Vehicle, Transportation, and Travel / Post office / Stationery / Business and Commerce / Architecture / Literature, Television, and Movies / Science and Engineering / Miscellaneous) which are the biggest source domains where new cyberspaces words come from."

The instructional format (e.g., Trading Spaces, Extreme Makeover) offers expert advice on how to transform ones identity through correct consumer behavior. The competitive format (e.g., Survivor, The Apprentice) allow viewers to vicariously participate in and compare themselves in reference to the cast members survival of the fittest, capitalistic struggle, for a monetary or otherwise commodified reward. What both of these genres have in common is that they provide a forum for viewers to construct and reshape their identities around the increasingly globalized values of capitalism, values rooted in consumerism, individualism, and narcissism. Constructing and reshaping ones identity around these values has become an increasingly relevant task as more traditional forms of identity begin to lose salience in a globalized world."

It compares consultancies, clients, budgets, and programming to 142 pre-NAFTA listings of 1986-1991. The study asserts that NAFTA and other trade-related public relations in the United States influenced public relations roles and international public relations between Mexico and the United States but did not mark a landmark swing. The increase in the PR manager role did not correlate with more symmetric or ethical public relations.
The study also examines some of the sources of influence for Mexico-U.S. public policy and illuminates organizational inputs into NAFTA media coverage and policy decisions. The author posits that reliance on short-term lobbying and the personal influence model rather than full-fledged public relations programming and relationship building may have contributed, along with U.S. economic variables, to the NAFTA public backlash less than a decade later."

This project explores the way that the story of Jessica Lynch provides for a powerful space on which to map cultural and political narratives about gender and war. In tracing the symbolic and ideological use of the figure of the female soldier embodied by Jessica Lynch by national media discourses I propose that the female soldier becomes a sight for the constitution of a series of normative paradoxes, but also a point of entry for the debates about women and war. The story of Jessica Lynch is about contradictions to the core of normative narratives of war and gender. Indeed, the nations investment in Jessica Lynch is about the celebration of a potentially disruptive kind of femininity; it is about the celebration of an American female soldier. At the same time, the media interpreted the events surrounding Lynchs capture and rescue in such a way that would uphold masculinitys centrality to the war system by explicitly containing her militarized femininity."

Both women and men overestimated thinness preferred by other women and men. Men in dating relationships overestimated thinness preferred by their female dating partners, while women in dating relationships had accurate estimations of their male dating partners norms of ideal thinness. Both women and men also overestimated the influence of the thin ideal on other women and men. However, third-person perceptions were not found in dating relationships. When the third-person perceptions about the media effect were tested, along with peoples own norms of ideal thinness, the two variables accounted for a significant amount of variance in biased perceptions about the norm of ideal thinness."

The original goal of 2000 has been reset for 2005. Communication programs have made important contributions to polio eradication, but overall results have not been reviewed. This paper synthesizes evidence-based studies and explores the links between communication and disease control programs. The findings suggest that polio partners only belatedly have recognized the relevance of communication programs only after the PEI confronted a number of social problems, mainly resistance and negative rumors about polio vaccine. To deal successfully with these issues, a serious consideration of communication issues and the shift from an informational to a social behavioral approach to communication are required. The PEI offers important lessons for other global health programs: communication and social aspects need to be addressed early in the design of the intervention, and social and cultural expectations related to vaccination and other health issues need to be identified and properly integrated."

Taking this perspective, this paper argues that political talk during a presidential campaign must be examined as an analytical category in its own right. Analyzing the National Election Study 2000 panel data, this paper shows that political talk among the general public during the campaign was quite prevalent. The likelihood and frequency of engaging in political talk during the campaign were related to individuals propensity to participate in public life and resulted from individuals ideological intensity and interest in the campaign, and stimulated by exposure to campaign messages and campaign-related contacts by various groups and individuals. General uses of news and public affairs media contributed to more political talk and campaign participation indirectly by increasing the frequency of exposure to campaign messages on media. Theoretical implications to the research on political campaigns in particular and media effects in general are discussed."

The subject is of interest for several reasons. First, U.S. currency is arguably the most important currency in the world today, but it is neglected within the small body of recent scholarly literature on the history of paper money and national currencies. This study aims to begin filling this gap and to introduce communication scholars to the subject. Second, a study of U.S. paper currency provides an opportunity to examine the special characteristics of paper money which, unlike metal currency, is intrinsically worthless. For this reason, the documentary and aesthetic conventions of paper money are significant in that they reveal the issuing authoritys attempt to impute value where, strictly speaking, there is none. As a medium of mass communication, physical circulating money is often taken for granted; it is ubiquitous and prosaic to the point of invisibility. Though communication scholars, including McLuhan and Habermas, have addressed the subject of money, they have tended to minimize or overlook the role of circulating physical currency as a medium of mass communication. Using the U.S. as an example, it is argued that national currencies are legitimized by the state through the iconography of nationalism, a powerful textual and symbolic motif that is not merely arbitrary or fanciful, but essential to the mass communication of value and generalized social trust."

This approach is premised on an epistemological openness that at the same time recognizes that inconsistencies and incompatibilities between theoretical discourses must be taken seriously and attended to accordingly. More specifically, we offer a picturing tool that can potentially facilitate dialogue across discourse boundaries. A major aim of our paper is to propose that interdisciplinary dialogue requires tools which are communicatively-designed and allow for comparisons that are as free as possible of the discourses being compared."

The human brain developed to deal with the real world. Real things, moving through real environments, pursuing goals related to living. Our goal is to consider how the structure and the content of mediated messages automatically and differentially activate the appetitive and aversive motivational systems in the human being, and how that differential activation impacts higher order emotional and cognitive processing of media and media messages. In order to do this, this paper reviews three basic theoretical perspectives: 1) a theoretical perspective on thinking; 2) a theoretical perspective on motivation and emotion; 3) a theoretical perspective on media. Following this background material, the paper applies these theoretical perspectives, in concert, to four basic questions: 1) How and when do media activate underlying motivational systems? 2) How does activation of the motivational systems impact emotional response? 3) How does the activation of underlying motivational systems impact thinking? 4) How does motivational activation, as an individual difference, affect media use and mediated message processing? Each of these four questions is considered first in general, as related to any medium  and then in the context of playing and designing video games."

The author employs content analysis of the decision-making process of gatekeepers at a Korean-language newsroom followed by an indepth interview with the local section editor called Mr. KoAm Gates. The results of this study show that, if a news item does not involve any Korean/Korean American, it is three or four times more likely to be rejected by the gatekeeper than a news item that involves a Korean/Korean American. Gatekeepers at a Korean-language newspaper are more likely to focus on a distributive function than a feedback function. Crime, immigration/illegal aliens, and events/conferences are the ethnic newspapers favorite news topics. The main channels of news gathering are each journalists beat and the American news media. Mr. KoAm Gates perceives his functions as a journalist at an ethnic minority newspaper to be assimilative and pluralistic."

CATALYST FOR OR ENCUMBRANCE TO SOCIAL CHANGE DIALOGUE

ABSTRACT

According to a proverb of unknown origin:

""Two are better than one because together they can work more effectively. If one of them falls down, the other can lift her up.""

This adage defines the essence of a multicultural feminism that encourages dialogue and collective voice to benefit women of Color by facilitating an improved quality of life for them. Evidence is lacking, however, about whether women of Color practice multicultural feminism or even communicate to affect change.

To collect information to support or deny the practice of multicultural feminism, as dialogue and
communication among women of Color, in the lives of women of Color, ethnographic interviews of a total of 24 women of Color in New York City and Los Angeles were used. The research was designed to study three questions:

1. Do women of Color believe that communication, dialogue and interaction, as a part of multicultural feminism, are useful in improving their collective status?

2. Do women of Color attempt to unite in an effort to raise their socioeconomic and sociopolitical status by communicating with one another and among each other?

3. If women of Color do not unite, are there either external societal factors or factors internal to women of Color as a group that keep them from beginning a dialogue about uniting as one group of women to affect social change?"

It first examined the nature of government affairs of MNCs in China. It then analyzed the types of MNC-Chinese government relationships (MGRs) from a coopetitive view developed by Luo (2003). Lastly, it looked at how the types of MGRs affect the MNCs selection of political strategies for policy- or regulatory-related issues. Twenty-six qualitative interviews were conducted in this exploratory study, with 24 MNCs in China, a government affairs manager in the US-China Business Council, and a journalist in a major Chinese news agency. Results showed that government affairs of MNCs in China was management of communication, issues, and relationships with different levels of the government. Government affairs commonly had six major functions across the MNCs. These functions were needed for the MNCs to effectively manage their coopetitive relations, which contained co-existing competition and cooperation elements, with the Chinese government. The practice of these functions was shaped by political- economic, and cultural characteristics in China. Based on the MNCs varying degrees of competition and cooperation, four types of MGRs emerged. However, the types of MGRs did not serve as an antecedent factor for the MNCs selection of political strategies. Instead, the MNCs applied a similar set of strategies: accommodation, adaptation, influence, and compromise."

We also examined factors that differentiate among seekers of health information. A segmentation analysis of Midwesterners was conducted using consumer- (demographics) and issue-oriented (health perceptions and information sources) variables. The subjects were a random sample of 483 individuals from a Midwestern state, contacted via a digit dial telephone survey. Cluster analysis of the variables revealed four distinct groups: Health At-Risk, Health Autonomous, Health Conscious and Health Informed. The four groups significantly varied in their general health and arthritis-related health perceptions as well as types and perceived credibility of health information sources used."
2005-1012,Multiple Media Use and Multitasking with Media Among High School and College Students,Media Effects: Breaking New Ground,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Multiple Media Use and Multitasking with Media Among High School and College Students,Media Effects: Breaking New Ground,"This paper explores the media use patterns of 102 high school and college students with the goal of assessing: 1) the prevalence of media use in the daily lives of young audiences; 2) the extent to which respondents multitask with media and use multiple media simultaneously; and 3) whether there are differences in media use patterns between high school teens (ages 14-16) and college age young adults (17-22). Respondents kept a daily time use diary for seven consecutive days detailing their media use and other activities. Analyses indicate that high school students spend, on average, 4 ½ hours a day with media while college students spend an average of 6 hours a day using media. Multiple simultaneous use of media was a relatively infrequent activity, occurring only 17 percent of the time. Multitasking with media was much more prevalent in this sample, occurring almost 77 percent of the time. The overall proportion of time spent using multiple media and multitasking was significantly greater for college age students. Interestingly, age differences in media use, multitasking and multiple media use disappeared on Fridays and Saturdays, suggesting that it is the structure of the day (i.e., no school or schoolwork) that shapes how much and how media are used. The paper concludes by considering the ways in which multitasking and multiple media use might shape both our notions of exposure to media content and our conceptualization of media effects on youth."
2005-1013,"My Job Sucks: Counter-Institutional Websites as Locations for Organizational Member Voice, Dissent, and Resistance",Anticipatory Socialization and Recruitment,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,"My Job Sucks: Counter-Institutional Websites as Locations for Organizational Member Voice, Dissent, and Resistance",Anticipatory Socialization and Recruitment,"Counter-institutional websites are often dismissed as simply publicizing the ranting of disgruntled employees and customers. We argue that these sites also provide the opportunity for organizational stakeholders to take part in discussions that might normally be prevented within the traditional work environment. These websites enable individuals to publicly and anonymously voice their concerns, disdain, or frustration with particular institutions, without fear of retribution or termination. We argue that counter-institutional websites provide new opportunities for member voice and offer scholars the rare opportunity to examine member dissent and resistance efforts as they develop, rather than after the fact. A close examination of one of these counter-institutional sites (RadioShackSucks.com) illustrates the various voice, dissent, and resistance functions that such sites provide."

Derived from the news coverage of the potential breakdown of a joint operating agreement (JOA) between the two dailies, the myths are labeled David and Goliath, Independent Publisher, Press Baron, and Marketplace of Ideas. These myths are explored and expanded upon through interviews with local journalism professionals, and assessed for frequency of mention in a content analysis of texts from three Seattle newspapers, including the competing dailies. The study finds that mythical themes can be applied to the personalities and powers involved in creating and covering the news. It also illustrates the utility of myth for informing and inspiring journalistic dialogue about news coverage, newspaper competition."

This essay looks at the recent YUKOS crisis and the role that society (largely press media) assigned to President Putin in the YUKOS case. In fact, news is often viewed as a force reifying social order and power structure in a society. This reification occurs through interpreting events through a prism of so-called common knowledge that transfers from generation to generation in myths. Jung calls it collective unconscious. This essay suggests viewing myths also as enforcing symbiotic relations: human beings create artificial ties to connect themselves with the world around and make sense out of this world and of their lives. Myth, in this sense, is not only passive collective unconscious but an active re-formulation of reality."

Feminist scholarship posits beauty as a social construction that is also a marker of power in terms of race and class. This study examines constructions of race in relation to beauty in the top-circulating magazine for adolescent girls, Seventeen. Teen magazinesfashion and beauty magazines aimed at adolescent female readersare an important factor in girls socialization. Using semiology and myth analysis, this study examines the ways in which beauty is activated through the use of multiracialism. It was found that in these magazines, race was a consumer option, devoid of history or social meaning. In a sense the magazines texts and images represent a Utopian future in which racial differences and the attendant social discriminations are nonexistent. In addition, the myriad crosscultural hybrdizations that mark youth culture today was absent."

Empirically, the study examined the relationship between narcissism and self-presentation. Participants (N = 178) responded to questionnaires measuring narcissism, self-presentation tactics, dominance, perspective-taking, and self-esteem. Multiple measures of narcissism, self-presentation, and dominance were included. Narcissism had significantly positive associations with all Self Presentation Influence Tactics (SPIT) Ratings self-promotion, ingratiation, intimidation, and supplication. However, in the coded self-presentation responses, narcissism was positively related with the use of intimidation tactics and not the other tactics. Compared with the new narcissism scale, the shortened Margolis-Thomas Measure of Narcissism (MT) scale seems to show pathological aspect of narcissism with respect to association with self-esteem and perspective taking."
2005-1018,Narratives of the SARS Epidemic and Ethical Implications for Public Health Crises,Public Health Crisis Response,Public Relations,,,Paper,Narratives of the SARS Epidemic and Ethical Implications for Public Health Crises,Public Health Crisis Response,"The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic provides a good case for study of crisis communication and the narratives used to respond to the epidemic. Interspecies transmission of a virus led to crisis in many public health networks, countries, and organizations. During this epidemic, competing narratives emerged, and were at odds with one another resulting in confusion, misinformation, and contagion of an often fatal disease. The narrative emerging in China led to the incomplete enactment of the broader, more global one that ultimately dominated organized global public health response. This case warrants close study because it is comprised of dimensions of organizational crisis, public health crisis, ethical crisis, and natural crisis in the origin of the disease. Lessons learned from the crisis response to the SARS epidemic include the need to respond with rapid, factual, and honest narratives and an ethical dedication to communicate on behalf of the public interest to prevent the needless spread of disease and loss of life."

The paper begins by introducing the method of function-time analysis. It then explores the process of political narrative construction in the transition from indoor discussion to public oration, through an examination of Israeli ministerial discourse during the early years of the state. This analysis identifies a growing tendency to use longer stories with an historical time line as the discussion gains a wider audience and as the debate itself grows more polemic. Thus it presents an empirical indication of the association between argumentative needs and the construction of political narratives."

The characteristics of Necessary Convergence of Meaning [NCM] are presented along with the antecedent conditions and a-priori assumptions linked to this theoretical framework.

The author argues that theory development is as important as theory testing in the social sciences, and contends that NCM has utility to generate additional knowledge about the role of power and connection in interpersonal communication."
2005-1021,Negotiating News Representations of Sexual Assault: Structure and Agency in Reporting on Rape,Reporting Crime: Representation of Violence,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Negotiating News Representations of Sexual Assault: Structure and Agency in Reporting on Rape,Reporting Crime: Representation of Violence,"This case study examines local television news production of investigative reports about a campus rape scandal, focusing on the interplay between structural constraints and human agency from within a mainstream news organization. The study examines the construction of nine stories that described a pattern whereby female assault victims left the college to avoid contact with male perpetrators whose expulsions had been consistently overturned by a vice-president, in violation of campus disciplinary policy. The stories reflected gender-sensitive reporting by giving voice to rape survivors and avoiding the perpetuation of rape myths, as is common in news about sexual assault. The paper argues that such representations emerge from a scenario in which the priorities of a particular social movement, feminism, overlapped with those of investigative journalism, especially as they were tied to the work of the central journalist."

Few would disagree that art has transformative effects on those who create it and appreciate it. Yet the process of exactly how this creativity works is still little understood. This powerpoint presentation consists of two parts: 1.) a visual presentation of two case studies drawn from a studio class on visual thinking and creativity, Art IS 310, Sources of Visual Design, taught by Dennis Dake, Professor, at Iowa State University. 2.) a discussion of the neurological correlates which characterize the creative process in the brain. It provides a neurologically based analysis of the creative process and is predicated on three beliefs: that openness to emotional states may be linked to transformation ability (Lubart & Getz, 1997), that metaphor may be both a tool for this transformation and a reflection of basic neurological process in vision, and that connections made emotionally in the process of producing art may lead to paradigmatic shifts in cognition which affect the quality and direction of future life decisions."

This paper takes a refined approach to digital inequality in examining differences in young adults use of the medium. Young adults are the most highly connected age group, but that does not mean that their online uses are homogenous. Analyzing data about the Web uses of 270 adult Internet users from across the United States, the article explores the differences in 18-26-year-olds Web uses and examines what social factors explain variation in amounts and types of uses. Findings suggest that those with higher socio-economic background use the Web for more capital-enhancing activities. Detailed analyses of user attributes also reveal that online skill is an important mediating factor in the types of activities people pursue online. We discuss the implications of these findings for a second-level digital divide, that is, differences among the population of young adult Internet users."

In this case study we investigate the role of digital media in the communication networks of a computer science research group in relation to more traditional communications in journal publications and research projects. Taking co-author networks and project collaboration networks as point of departure, we try to answer the question to what extent the ego-networks of this research group are reinforced or modified by the use of new media (email, internet, WWW). We show how producers and users of knowledge are located in the various networks maintained by the new media, and how new media are used to maintain relations with different types of organizations."

Howard Deans surprisingly successful campaign reinforced this idea as he became the poster child of Internet success with his Dean Team Leaders, monthly MeetUps, and red bat fundraising thermometer. It seemed that these new media were reaching out to an audience that had steadily been declining in participation since initially afforded the franchise: young voters. This paper examines the following question: are new media campaign techniques engaging young people to be more active in the civic process?

I maintain that there is a role for new media in engaging youth to be more active if we look at a variety of opportunities for civic engagement. However, I believe that it must be a multitude of messages through various media that incentivize an individual to actually get out and vote.

I provide a short review of literature in the areas of youth engagement, new media campaigning, and strong and weak ties. I then provide analysis of 287 responses to an online survey I conducted in late 2003. The results of this survey indicate that there are a number of new media campaign techniques that correlate with individuals feeling informed about a campaign, having paid attention to a campaign, or having been involved with a campaign. This, coupled with the increasing entrenchment of new media into our personal and interpersonal lives, indicates an area for further research."

Information and communication technologies are having a paradoxical impact on the border Mexico-USA regions: on one hand consolidating the power and influence of the major Mexico and USA Mass Media Groups (creating a group of global influence) and on the other one extending their influence over a new mass media consumers, whose language (Spanish) is an attractive market for both USA and Mexico Mass Media Groups.

This paper attempts to explain these forces to establish whether their impact over the Mass Media consumers. So we have to try to identify the preferred attributes of a region in this environment and, using a face to face research among inhabitants of Baja California north border state with USA.

The approach in developing this paper has been to conduct a literature review from a variety of disciplines and sources covering economic, politics and new communication theories.

We presented a preliminary work in BINACOM last meeting in New Orleans. Now we have finished the research and it is ready to diffuse. The research was made in Facultad de Ciencias Humanas of Universidad Autonoma de Baja California."

The objectives of this study are to assess the effects of priming a belief in genetic susceptibility to smoking addiction on smokers inferences about their own susceptibility to a genetic addiction to smoking, their efficacy to quit smoking, and their intention to get a genetic test for addiction susceptibility. Subjects were 450 young adult smokers recruited in a national random-digit-dialing sample. They were surveyed on the telephone in a randomized experiment embedded in a survey about cigarette smoking practices. In the priming condition, respondents heard an abbreviated news story about genes for smoking addiction. In the unprimed condition, participants heard a news story concerning the gender of the offspring of smokers. Priming with the genetics news story did not affect respondents inferences about personal genetic susceptibility to smoking addiction. However, those finding the news story credible and having a strong family history of smoking were more likely to infer a greater personal genetic susceptibility. The impact of the news story about genetic susceptibility on the intention to get a genetic test and the efficacy to quit smoking is not direct, but is mediated through the inference of genetic susceptibility to smoking addiction."

News leads are typically accompanied by three cuesthe name of the primary source from which the headline and lead were borrowed, the time elapsed since the story broke, and the number of related articles written about this story by other news organizations tracked by the newsbot. This paper investigates the psychological significance of these cues by positing that each cue triggers a distinct heuristic (mental shortcut) that tends to influence online users perceptions of a given news item. A large 2x3x6 within-subjects online experiment (N = 523) systematically varied two levels of the source-credibility cue, three levels of the upload-recency cue and six levels of the number-of-related-articles cue in an effort to investigate their effects upon perceived message credibility, newsworthiness and likelihood of clicking on the news lead. Results showed evidence for source primacy effect, and some indication of a cue-cumulation effect when source credibility is low. Findings are discussed in the context of machine and bandwagon heuristics."

Indeed, few studies have systematically explored the possibility that framing effects are amplified or attenuated by the predispositions and emotional reactions that an individual brings to information processing. We address these issues by examining the interplay of news frames and political predispositions on the complexity of individuals cognitive responses. As a context for our study, we present research participants with news stories concerning the surveillance of political activists under the USA PATRIOT Act. We manipulate two factors: (1) whether the story is framed around an individual or a group as the focus of government scrutiny, and (2) whether the respondent supported or opposed the cause being advocated by the featured target. These two factors  the social level of the news frame and the affective reactions generated by the cause predisposition  and their interplay are expected to shape the extent of cognitive processing."
2005-1053,News Media Choices and the Polarization of Attitudes,Media Influences on Public Opinion,Political Communication,,,Paper,News Media Choices and the Polarization of Attitudes,Media Influences on Public Opinion,"Political commentators have noted the current trend of extreme attitudes held by many individuals on both the left and the right of American politics. The present study examines whether the choice of where respondents receive their news and their income levels play a role in this polarization of attitudes. Findings from a national telephone survey suggest that choice of sources for news information was an important factor in the polarization of attitudes. In general, radio listeners were the most polarized of the respondents, while newspaper readers were the least polarized. Radio content, such as conservative talk shows, could be reinforcing some respondents already conservative beliefs, making their attitudes even more extreme. In-depth coverage in newspapers, on the other hand, may be exposing readers to both sides of issues, leading to less extreme viewpoints. Income, meanwhile, played a lesser role in polarization."

Language may play a significant role in this contest. On the one hand, news media may render certain viewpoints, information, and topics reportable through the use of discursive strategies. On the other hand, news media may also employ discursive strategies to absolve themselves from the responsibility of confronting the political power center. The present study focuses on the case of Hong Kong. It analyzes how two local newspapers handle a highly important yet sensitive political issue in their editorials. The two newspapers are found to have used two different sets of discursive strategies as they tried to handle political pressure, market credibility, and journalistic integrity at the same time. The elite-oriented Ming Pao adopted the strategies of balanced criticisms, characterizations of agents in the controversy, and emphasis on rational discussion to posit itself as an impartial arbitrator of the ongoing political debate. The mass-oriented Apple Daily, in contrast, took side in the debate and provided direct and harsher political criticisms towards the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. Nevertheless, it also used the strategies of appropriation of dominant discourse, construction of internal contradictions within the power center, and decentralization of the Chinese Central government in order to smooth out the radicalism of its criticisms."
2005-1057,Newspaper Reading and Electoral Participation: Consonant and Dissonant Information Exposure Effects,Predicting Political Behavior,Political Communication,,,Paper,Newspaper Reading and Electoral Participation: Consonant and Dissonant Information Exposure Effects,Predicting Political Behavior,"Does exposure to political information that is dissonant with ones own political attitudes hinder electoral participation? Recent studies indicate that party-political cross-pressures (exposure to party-political information that is dissonant with ones own party-political attitudes) may demobilize the electorate, whereas exposure to consonant information may enhance the likelihood to vote. This paper studies whether this theory also applies to other political attitudes. It argues that findings in previous studies may be distorted by self-selection effects. In order to minimize such explanations, this paper focuses on attitudes that are not likely to play a large role in newspaper selection, namely attitudes towards the European Union. The paper studies the relationship between these attitudes, exposure to news that is consonant or dissonant with these attitudes, and voter participation in elections to the European Parliament.
To test the effect of consonant and dissonant information exposure on electoral participation, the study employs survey data from the European Election Study 1999. It focuses on Britain, where newspapers can be classified according to their pro-or anti-European stances. The analyses show that exposure to consonant newspaper contents indeed mobilizes citizens to go vote, irrespective of the attitude one holds towards the EU. It implies that reading a consonant paper affects participation positively, even if one is negative towards the EU. For cross-pressures, no effect is found, which may be due to a differential effect for political (un-)informedness. The results indicate that this indeed might be the case. In the concluding paragraph, implications of the findings will be discussed."

The quality of journalism may be especially important where democratic processes and economic privatization are emerging. This paper examines how journalists perceive the practice and quality of journalism in Slovenia as it has evolved since the countrys independence in 1991. The researchers had the opportunity to examine this perspective a few weeks after the accession of Slovenia into the European Union. Participants express concerns about pressures on editorial content induced by politicians, privatization, advertisers and stockholder profit goals. Of particular concern are convoluted ownership patterns that obscure overlapping interests and government involvement, threats to media plurality and diversity of voice in the marketplace of ideas, and the phenomenon of self-censorship. Despite apparent structural barriers to achieving and maintaining quality journalistic practices, the authors find evidence that it is still possible for journalists to construct more positive and progressive journalistic practice."
2005-1059,News Pictures and the Official Story in Iraq,The Visual Construction of News,Visual Studies,,,Extended Abstract,News Pictures and the Official Story in Iraq,The Visual Construction of News,"The role of pictures, and particularly photographically based images, in news reporting hinges on their status as presumed reflections of external reality. As naturalized evidence of events, pictures underpin the legitimacy and authority of news reporters, lending a sense of verifiability to the written or spoken word even when no unique or additional information is provided by the visual illustration. When we look at published photographs or televised video reports we are encouraged to think of the camera as a simple extension of our own vision, allowing us to survey the world for ourselves. Despite countless studies of TV news and photojournalism that debunk these assumptions, most people are still ready to believe that photography simply reveals the world to us. What visual communication scholars call the reflection hypothesis of photography lives on.
This suggests that photographs alone may not have the power to drive the news without the evocation of a contextual interpretive frame. Predominant news frames, usually flowing from those official sources that news organizations rely upon so routinely for their daily reports, envelope rather than respond to pictures that are produced, incorporating images into the narrative and rhetorical conventions and patterns that have priority. This completed paper will provide an in-depth analysis of specific patterns of visual coverage to discover the precise nature of image-text relationships in U.S. news related to Iraq."
2005-1060,Nigeria: Equivocating while Opening the Broadcast Liberalization Gates,Governing Media Industries,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Nigeria: Equivocating while Opening the Broadcast Liberalization Gates,Governing Media Industries,"There is a notion that broadcast liberalization is intricately linked to the development of democratic institutions. After all, democracy breeds competition and broadcast liberalization is at its best, a competitive market system. Thus, both should logically be associated. This notion has held true for several states that have recently liberalized their broadcast industry. However, it was not true of Nigeria, which liberalized its broadcast industry in the last decade. In Nigerias case, it appeared an anomaly to have a military dictatorship essentially develop a competitive market system. To be sure, General Babangida's move to reform the broadcast industry was not a benevolent one, as one would imagine. It simply was the pragmatic thing to do considering the forces that aligned against the continued state ownership of broadcast media.
This paper is designed to record the difficult road to broadcast market liberalization in Nigeria under a military dictatorship regime. It will review the historical control of the broadcast market by the state in Nigeria. In addition, the paper will delve into the discussion of the pressures that finally forced market liberalization as well as the instruments used by the dictatorship to open the market. The impact of liberalization shall focus on two distinct periods: (a) under military dictatorships and (b) under the nascent democratic system that followed in 1999. The periods are discussed separately because that are remarkably different and they both shed light on the fact that Nigerias military dictatorships never fully accepted liberalization."

From this data, five speech acts that women with diabetes encounter when attempting to engage in healthy eating behaviors were identified and described: deterrence, indifference, encouragement, compliment and temptation. In addition, the data generated a new theory, The Theory of Social Support and Diet, which explains how these speech acts can be perceived as either supportive or non-supportive or both supportive and non-supportive.

It is not a paper to conduct statistical tests to support theoretical propositions, but a paper to explicate a concept to challenge for a new way of thinking. Describing the audience studied in the conventional communications research as passive and/or pseudo-active, the current paper suggests the materialization of a truly active audience that has not yet been clearly discerned. To reach such a conclusion, the author largely recapitulates the previous approaches to audience studies in terms of audience activity. Then, while certain phenomena in the digital age are attributed to the audience in this paper, the new audience is conceptualized as a truly active audience that is not only an active critical thinker, but also an active participant to shape media content or agenda."

From fat to thin, to the exploitation of their fame and their self-promotion, the public and private worlds of these two women are very similarly framed by the popular press. More than being made similar in how we dismiss them, these two women have manipulated their own excessive performances to yield the very fame that causes their dismissal. This is worth examination, for if one could manipulate their own cultural construction by ignoring the cultural rules for appropriate performance, there is a degree of resistance within such a gesture. Therefore, if celebrity bodies can perform excess that successfully resists, can less recognizable women also reclaim such spaces for the production of stronger, more salient identities? Further, the identification of which cultural boundaries Anna and Carnie push against and ignore are also key elements to understanding the critical discourse surrounding them. While seemingly succumbing to the system, they also expose its rules, further amplifying the normative ways in which womens bodies are constructed and maintained."

While in liberal societies, this phenomenon has been attributed to commercialization, I argue that in Singapore, this human-interest element could be traced to the ideological dominance of the one-party government. In the absence of alternative frames, the official framing of national issues as questions of personal morality becomes the dominant ideological frame for journalists. There are two significant consequences of the shift from a political to a moral frame: the distinction between hard and soft news is blurred and media discourse becomes de-politicized."

The federal appeals court held that his court did not have personal jurisdiction over the French groups. And it declined to review whether Yahoo!s action for declaratory relief was ripe for adjudication or whether Judge Fogel properly refused to abstain from hearing this case.
Although it was long expected to be history-making, the Ninth Circuits ruling was tellingly anticlimactic in minimally reconciling U.S. and French (and other nations) old laws in cyberspace. Nonetheless, the Yahoo! case as a whole is bound to affect freedom of speech and the press in the United States and beyond.

In this paper, we demonstrate the utilization of a discussion group design and analytical process informed by Sense-Making Methodology to highlight the relationship between situational aspects of online dialogue and consensus/dissensus activity. We analyzed 1,360 messages submitted to three pedagogical discussion groups. The postings fell into two broad situational modes: (a) self-relating-to-others (abbreviated as self-others), which coincided with greater numbers of agreeing/disagreeing communicative verbings, and (b) self-relating-to-self (abbreviated as self-self), which focused more on personalized observation and communicating behaviors that highlighted meaning-making rather than meaning-sharing practices. These findings suggest that, counter to received theories advocating the privileging of user-to-user interaction within online discussion groups, both modes -- self-others and self-self -- appeared to be necessary for robust communicative activities."

Such a development may have consequences for the nature of public opinion over time and even for the functioning of democratic societies. This paper is designed to evaluate whether online news audiences read broadly when they are on the Internet or, as many observers expect, focus their reading on a limited number of topics. The data examined in this analysis are records of online news selection over a period of two months by a nationally representative sample of Internet users. These data were subjected to cluster analyses that identified groups with similar news reading patterns. The resulting clusters show that the online news audience contains a large number of highly focused readers of news and information. These results suggest that the Internet is conducive to reader specialization. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the results for the issue of public fragmentation."

The proponents of disembodiment assert that cyberspace is an emancipatory sphere for women because gender does not exist online, while the proponents of embodiment assert that the new cyberspaces may in fact be gendered spaces because the internet is reflective of our social values as a whole, and since gender bias exists in the broader culture, it surely exists in cyberspace (Gurak On Bob 12).

Informed by the feminist paradigm, participant observation of an online bulletin and message board was conducted --each of the boards are on an online girls magazine web site. It was assumed here that because such magazines are the most popular web sites among teenage girls, they would be the best type of online content in which gendered behavior can be observed (jmm.com).

During the data collection period, the users of the bulletin and message board under study acted as gendered beings. This finding supports research started in the early 1990s by Herring, and radical cyberfeminism, according to which embodiment, or gendered behavior, online is natural. Radical cyberfeminism asserts that the internet merely reflects current social values as a whole. On a larger scale, the finding of this study supports the feminist belief that gender is socially constructed."

It is within this primary and unfolding action, its horizons and possibilities, taking into account my own concerns and goals, that other people, events, and objects, might or might not affect me. In this paper we point out the relevance of the course of action in which a person already is involved  his or her concerns, goals, projects and dispositions  for the shaping of meaning of whatever comes across himself or herself. The meaning of dialogue, of other people discourses, of opportunities and threats might not rely so much on the kind of information a person accesses, but instead it might indeed very much rely on the persons own and already set kind of concerns and goals."

More specifically, we hypothesized and found that when an agent exhibited brands that were rated high on the brand personality dimension of competence (Aaker, 1997), these can induce patterns of nonverbal submissive behavior in the antagonist. Compared to control conditions, participants exposed to high-competence brands showed more frequent sequences of submissive nonverbal behaviors such as looking at the agent while listening to him, nodding affirmatively, coy smiling and blushing. This effect of brand competence on hierarchisation was more pronounced for individuals with a low intrinsic tendency for dominant behavior."

This paper examines the structure of symbolization manifest in ""Human Remains,"" a black and white documentary film about Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Franco, and Mussolini. Drawing from Lacanian psychoanalytic theories of the Real, the editing technique of cutting to black is interpreted as the means by which this documentary holds open the place of lack constitutive of the visual field. Symbolized by the form of the blank screen, the void-place of symbolic inscription is exposed in ""Human Remains"" as the object-cause of the proliferation of images of evil, the source of support for their power to fascinate as masks of social harmony."

First of all, a meta-analysis of ten empirical studies on the formal quality of poll reporting is undertaken. The studies are re-examined systematically in order to find out what exactly the problems with the reporting of polls are. In addition, the meta-analysis aims to systematize the different variables which are used in the content analyses in order to make suggestions for further research on poll coverage. Secondly, results of a qualitative investigation of the relationship between journalists and pollsters in Germany are presented regarding structural aspects of the relationship between journalism and opinion polling. The in-depth interviews highlight the self perceptions and the mutual expectations of representatives of the two professional groups. On the basis of these findings, proposals for the improvement of the press-polling-relationship are discussed."

The study shows that the surveyed journalists reported practicing self-censorship less often than their colleagues did. Both broadcast and print journalists would believe that they face less editorial control than their cross-media counterparts. There was no gender difference in terms of journalists perception of self-censorship. The results supported the hypotheses proposed under the theory of optimistic bias.
2005-1078,Organizational Change: The Dialogue Between Change Agents and Targets,Communication and Organizational Change,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Organizational Change: The Dialogue Between Change Agents and Targets,Communication and Organizational Change,"Organizational change is prevalent in businesses today. At it simplest level, this situation involves a change agent who is directing change and a change target who is directly impacted by the proposed modifications. Often these two groups differ with regard to authority such that the change agent has greater authority and the proposed change reflects a top-down process. However, change targets can sometimes express their views of proposals and even propose alternatives. We are interested in such dialogues. We predict that change agents will construct messages to targets that are primarily focused on the economic outcomes of proposals, whereas change targets will construct messages that focus on generating new ideas. We conducted a role-play in which individuals played the role of university administrators cutting back the size of student groups or the presidents of the affected groups. These roles constructed messages about the proposed changes. Results supported our predictions."
2005-1079,Organizational Identification and the Communication of Identity: Effects of Message Characteristics,dentification and Sensemaking in Organizations,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Organizational Identification and the Communication of Identity: Effects of Message Characteristics,Identification and Sensemaking in Organizations,"The central focus of this paper was to identify how certain characteristics of a communication message contribute to organizational identification. A distinction was made between an affective component of organizational identification (closely related to affective commitment) and a cognitive component of organizational identification (more related to ones self-definition as a member of the organization. The main object of the study was to find out if these distinct forms of identification are under the influence of different aspects of communication messages. More specifically we looked at cues that signal organizational identity (in the form of company logo and the use of the typical organizational color scheme) and the focus of the message (personal vs. non-personal). The effects of these two characteristics on both components of organizational identification were tested in a 2 (organizational identity salience: no vs. yes) x 2 (focus of the message: personal vs. not personal) factorial design. This quasi-experimental study was conducted in a large international software company in Europe. Results confirmed our expectations: organizational identity salience had a strong effect on the cognitive component of organizational identification and no effect on the affective component, whereas the focus of the email (personal vs. non-personal) only yielded a significant effect on the affective component of organizational identification."
2005-1080,Organizational Identification During A Merger - Determinants of Expected Organizational Identification,dentification and Sensemaking in Organizations,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Organizational Identification During A Merger - Determinants of Expected Organizational Identification,Identification and Sensemaking in Organizations,"In order to investigate the development of organizational identification during a merger, a quasi-experimental case study was conducted on a pending merger of police organisations. The research was conducted among employees who would be directly involved in the merger and among indirectly involved employees. In contrast to earlier studies, organizational identification was measured as the expected identification prior to the merger. Five determinants were used to explain the employees expected identification: (a) identification with the pre-merger organisation, (b) expected utility of the merger, (c) sense of continuity, (d) communication climate before the merger, and (e) communication about the merger. The five determinants appeared to explain a considerable proportion of the variance of expected organizational identification. Results suggest that in order to obtain a strong identification with the soon to be merged organisation, managers should pay extra attention to present departments with weaker social bonds as these are expected to identify the least with the new organisation. The role of the communication variables differed between the two employee groups: communication about the merger only contributed to the organizational identification of directly involved employees; and communication climate only affected the identification of indirectly involved employees."

Specifically, four different lines of theory and associated research strategies on organizational communication and media are considered, namely, James Taylor and colleagues, Janet Fulk and colleagues, Noshir Contractor/Monge and colleagues, and Marshall Scott Pool and colleagues. The common themes and differences among these approaches and the implications for developing theory and research strategies to successfully investigate and explain media selection and usage within organizations are discussed."
2005-1102,Organizational Structure and Internal Communication as Antecedents of Employee-Organization Relationships: A Multilevel Analysis,Public Relations Top Student Papers,Public Relations,,,Paper,Organizational Structure and Internal Communication as Antecedents of Employee-Organization Relationships: A Multilevel Analysis,Public Relations Top Student Papers,"The antecedents of relationships are the first stage of the relationship framework (Broom, Casey, & Ritchey, 2000), for they are what cause specific relationships between an organization and its publics to develop. The purpose of this study was to integrate two possible antecedents into employee-organization relationship research. I explored the influence of organizational structure and internal communication on dimensions of employee-organization relationships. This study tested hypotheses by conducting a survey of employees in 31 Korean organizations. Measurement items taken from studies of relationship management, organizational structure, and internal communication were employed. In addition, the multilevel nature of main constructs of this study was addressed by using the multilevel analysis method. The results of this study showed that organizational structure and internal communication do function as the antecedents of employee-organization relationships. This study can help people understand how and why organizations come to have specific relationships with their employees."

Examining the Value of Luhmann’s Social Systems Theory for Organizational Communication Research,New Systems Perspectives in the Study of Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Organizations as Communications. Examining the Value of Luhmann’s Social Systems Theory for Organizational Communication Research,New Systems Perspectives in the Study of Organizational Communication,"The aim of this paper is to underline similarities between the constitutive perspective on organizational communication (e.g. Taylor, 2003) and Niklas Luhmann’s theory of social systems (1995; 2000). Following an overview of key insights of both approaches, suggestions are given how they could be integrated in the future. The analysis aims to show that, from a Luhmannian perspective, it is worthwhile to concentrate on decisions as communicational phenomena of organizations. This focus allows to analyze how organizations manage to transcend the paradox of the fundamental contingency of any decisions. The question is raised how these strategies of deparadoxification vary depending on genres and media applied in organizational communication, which is illustrated here by analyzing the increasing usage of Microsoft PowerPoint presentations in organizational communication."

A Critical Examination of Organizational Socialization Messages Found in Motion Pictures Targeting Teenage Girls,"Gender, Resistance and Socialization",Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Organizing Girls on Film? A Critical Examination of Organizational Socialization Messages Found in Motion Pictures Targeting Teenage Girls,"Gender, Resistance and Socialization","Organizational and gender socialization begin in childhood and continues throughout our lives. The following study presents a critical examination of organizational socialization messages presented to teenage girls through the medium of motion pictures. Todays teenagers are tomorrows future employees. As members of generation Y, or the echo boomers, they are likely to have a different perspective on organizations and organizing than their older colleagues. Understanding the mediated messages that are presented to them may provide an indication as to what they and future employers may expect in terms of organizational memberships. A total of 21 movies released in the United States between 2000 and 2004 were analyzed to explore messages that girls are receiving about the role and function of organizations as well as the relative importance of organizations compared to other commitments. The results reveal that while many films present messages that reinforce traditional stereotypes, others may in fact challenge girls to think critically about dominant ideologies."
2005-1105,Outline of a Multilevel Approach of the Network Society,New Media,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Outline of a Multilevel Approach of the Network Society,New Media,"Social and media networks, the Internet in particular, increasingly link interpersonal, organizational and mass communication. It is argued that this gives a cause for an interdisciplinary and multilevel approach of the network society. This will have to link traditional micro- and meso-level research of social and communication ties (Rogers, Granovetter a.o.) to the macro-level research of the network society at large (Castells a.o.).
Systems theory linked to a theory of communicative action establishes a potential basis for a multilevel theory. The systems theory described uses elements of a biologically inspired analysis of networks as complex adaptive systems and the mathematically inspired theory of random and scale-free networks recently elaborated by Barabási, Strogatz and Watts. The outline of the multilevel theory is summarized in ten statements about changing relationships in the network society: an information society with structures and modes of organization primarily shaped by social and media networks.
In the last section an inventory is made of the theoretical and methodological changes communication science will have to make to develop a general theory of the information and the network society in the perspective of communication."

Previous exposure to OTF objects, type of OTF object, and movement of the OTF object were between-participants variables, whereas exposure to OTF objects embedded within the movie presentations was the within-participants variable. Type of OTF object and type of OTF object movement were included into analysis to ensure that there are multiple instantiations of OTF objects inserted within a web page. Skin conductance responses and heart-rate measures were the main dependent variables.
The most interesting pattern found points towards the dissimilarity between skin conductance measures (SCR at onset and SCR at offset) and BPM change scores, suggesting that some OTF objects/movements are likely to elicit defense responses, whereas others are linked to orienting responses."

Since her public display of such a private moment, our discussion of her has been readily focused on how she is properly performing femininity (or not). When Al Roker also had the procedure done years later, the public response was much different. This paper analyzes the gendered differences in public discourse surrounding Wilson and Roker and how their obesity is framed by their gender. Further, after Roker's public outing regarding the surgery, Wilson enjoyed greater acclaim and praise for her procedure, rather than the criticism she received for bypassing traditional feminine responses to the inappropriate body."

An integrated model is supposed that links the concept of (positive and negative) Parasocial Relationships (PSR) to the concept of affective dispositions as used in the Affective Disposition Theory of Sportsfanship (ADT). Five hypotheses on the formation of suspense while viewing sports contests on television are derived and tested in an empirical study in the context of the popular sport ""Formula 1"". Results show a significant influence of both positive and negative forms of PSR on the viewers' hoping and, in turn, on the felt level of suspense."

One observation regarding parenting is that in the course of nurturing, parents will tell their children what to eat, what to wear, when to sleep, and when to bathe. However, simply telling children what to do does not always seem to produce compliance from the children and so the parents must seek other interactive resources if they are to pursue getting their children to obey. In this paper I will show how parents use coaxing as a way to get their children to perform a specific course of action that has been so far resisted. Although coaxing may be a form of persuasion that can occur between parties other than parents and children, the interest of this paper is to focus on coaxing as it is used in parent child interaction. This paper is based on the direct observation of parent-child interaction from a video-recording of a family eating dinner. Using conversation analysis, I explore where coaxing occurs in the course of parent-child interaction and what the consequences are for the ongoing interaction. By understanding coaxing in parent-child interaction we may be able to identify why coaxing is particularly suited to parenting and how this may contribute to our larger understanding of parenting practices."

Television mediation literature shows that restrictive meidation and coviewing help children understand the content better. This paper applies the mediation concepts to the new media. A sample of 167 children were recruited to answer a questionnaire at their own leisure. questions focus on how well children understand the concept of privacy and online information collection.

Specifically, how authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and neglectful parenting styles as well as home and bedroom Internet access influence the instructive and restrictive mediation techniques used by parents was investigated. Results indicate that parenting style has a significant effect on almost all mediation techniques under investigation, while increased access only appears to influence time online. Additionally, technological blocking as a restrictive mediation technique was found to be highest for permissive parents, followed by authoritative, authoritarian, and neglectful."
2005-1112,Participation in Alcohol-Involved Social Gatherings: A Test of Theory of Planned Behavior in Korea,Alcohol Abuse Prevention,Health Communication,,,Paper,Participation in Alcohol-Involved Social Gatherings: A Test of Theory of Planned Behavior in Korea,Alcohol Abuse Prevention,"A series of 6 studies are reported examining the applicability of the Theory of Planned Behavior for predicting and understanding Koreans participation in alcohol-involved social events (i.e., drinking parties). Specifically, this paper examines the social influence experienced by individuals when forming their intentions to join or refusing to join drinking parties and the behavior of joining or refusing to join drinking parties. Among Koreans, drinking parties provide an important context for interaction, that attendance is associated with a variety of communication outcomes (such as promoting group cohesion, providing a venue for conversation, obtaining information, etc.), and that going to these parties is the result of systematic social influence. Generally, the results showed that attitudes toward behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were significantly associated with both working adults and undergraduates behavioral intentions to join drinking parties, although none of the variables were significant for working adults behavioral intentions to refuse to attend drinking parties. Neither behavioral intention to join nor behavioral intention to refuse was significantly related to actual behavior (i.e., participation in drinking parties) for both working adults and undergraduates. Differences were observed between working adults and undergraduates for the links between specific behavioral outcomes and behavioral intentions. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed."

Results indicate a complex relation among information quantity, LOC, and partners LOC. Discussion addresses competitive and collaborative group contexts."
2005-1114,"Participatory Democracy in the Global Public Sphere: Scale, Media Events, and the Body",Predicting Political Behavior,Political Communication,,,Paper,"Participatory Democracy in the Global Public Sphere: Scale, Media Events, and the Body",Predicting Political Behavior,"A farmers deadly protest at WTO meeting in Cancun 2003 provokes a consideration of new forms of participatory democracy in the age of globalization. In the age of globalization, by staging or performing image events for mass media dissemination, local or national political resistance easily turns into global issues. Lees action is highly significant as a model that demonstrates not only the way in which local struggles achieve global significance but also how global citizens can exploit the immense possibilities of mass media to enact forms of activism adapted to a globally wired society. By especially focusing on the visual and performative aspects of resistance, this paper intends to discuss and delineate a transformation of citizen participation in the global public sphere, explore a possibility for enacting globalization from below, and consider the emergence of new forms of participatory democracy. In the meanwhile, the vital terms such as the public sphere, scale, and media events will be critically examined in the broader context of globalization."

This relationship is analyzed in coordination with the testing of perceptions of the proper role of government in society as a potential mediator. In addition, political party identification (Democrat, Republican, and Independent) is assessed as a potential moderator. This study reveals three distinct processes of mediation (or the lack thereof) across the distinct party identification groups, with the perceived role of government serving as a full mediator for Democrats, a simple mediator for Republicans, and not serving as a mediator for Independents."
2005-1116,Party Journalism Vs. Market Journalism: The Coverage of SARS by Chinese Newspapers,Emerging Issues in Chinese Media,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Party Journalism Vs. Market Journalism: The Coverage of SARS by Chinese Newspapers,Emerging Issues in Chinese Media,"To explore the impact of commercialization of the Chinese press, this study examined how Peoples Daily, organ of the Chinese Communist Party, and Beijing Youth News, a market-oriented newspaper, covered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. A qualitative analysis of the SARS-related stories shows that the two newspapers basically followed the Partys overall policy towards information management regarding the epidemic. The newspapers censorship and publicity of information about the epidemic were based on the Partys strategies of information management rather than their own editorial decisions. However, the two newspapers had some important differences in handling news about the Party leaders, the medical workers and the public. While Peoples Daily tended to follow the Party line in its daily reports about the epidemic, Beijing Youth News was more likely to follow its bottom line by presenting stories of greater relevance to the public."

This study, however, concerns the quality, that is, the variety of health-related online activities as well as the specific type of activity such as cancer-information seeking. This study, analyzing the 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey conducted by National Cancer Institute, confirmed that socio-economic status was associated with the frequency of Internet use on health information (B= .34, p< .001; B= .08, p< .001; and B= .09, p< .001, respectively for education level, income, and race/ethnicity; according to OLS multiple regression). This study further showed that the frequency of Internet use on health information is positively associated with both the variety (B= .26, p< .001 according to OLS multiple regression) and the specificity of health-related Internet use (OR= 1.61, 95% CI= 1.48-1.76 according to logistic regression). Moreover, the variety and the specificity of health-relevant Internet use were both found to be positively associated with knowledge acquirement of cancer (B= .05, p< .05 and B= .09, p< .001, respectively). Finally, pathways linking SES to acquirement of cancer knowledge, though the frequency, variety and specificity of internet use, were confirmed."
2005-1118,Patient Training and Patient Satisfaction: Data from Canada,Provider-Client Communication II: Client Issues,Health Communication,,,Paper,Patient Training and Patient Satisfaction: Data from Canada,Provider-Client Communication II: Client Issues,"114 adult patients voluntarily participated in the study which was carried out at a clinic in a northern city in B.C., Canada. Prior to their medical visits, participants in the experimental group received 10-15-minute face-to-face training on various ways of requesting their physicians to clarify a piece of previously elicited information during medical interviews, whereas the control group did not receive any training. Immediately after their medical visits, all participants filled out a patient satisfaction questionnaire. On all four dimensions of patient satisfaction, patients who received training scored significantly higher than patients who received no training. Other interesting findings include: (1) Seventy-eight percent (of the total) preferred a biopsychosocial model and 62% (of the total) reported receiving it. Twenty-two percent of them indicated that they preferred a business-like medical interview (i.e., get down to my symptoms and concerns right away). (2) Over half of the patients reported that they do make life-style changes such as quitting smoking and drinking as instructed by their physicians. The other half only occasionally or never did as their physicians told them to do. Results of this study suggest that a combination of pamphlet and a short face-to-face coaching on how to ask physicians questions during medical consultation can have significant effect. While much effort has been made to train physicians how to communicate effectively with patients, it is now time for patients to contribute their part."

This essay studies the performance of the tele-spectacle of the crime scene investigation conducted by the US-based forensics expert Dr. Henry Lee, and, more importantly, analyzes the significance of witnessing this spectacle. Specifically, I argue against the contention that media spectacles produce passive spectators. I assert that the process of the Taiwanese witnessing of the gunshot investigation allows a circulation of energies which opens up the possibility of addressing and responding to the subjectivity of those who hold different political and social ideologies. Drawing on Jonathan Crary and Kelly Olivers work, I contend that witnessing goes beyond looking. It is a space for creative syntheses of the spectators memory, imagination, emotion, and rationality. From these perspectives, I propose a way in which the Taiwanese people may experience witnessing and subjectivity as a sense of active agency, which is essential for both social transformation and active citizenship."

Mood, and the Intervention Potential of Media Messages.

An experiment investigated the influence of neuroticism on the mood management strategies and media preferences of 169 undergraduates. Participants completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI), were criticized or praised in an interview, and then given the opportunity to watch television programs that varied in their potential to disrupt cognitive rehearsal. Personality predicted selective exposure in the praise condition, but mood predicted media preferences when participants were criticized. Neuroticism was correlated with more intense negative moods and weaker positive moods in both experimental conditions. The intervention potential of TV affected recall and mood, but minimally influenced recognition. The results demonstrate that neuroticism negatively biases the perception of a stressful experience and influences selective exposure to entertainment media. However, when stress is intense, personality differences are leveled, and mood drives media preferences. These findings have implications for modifying theories of mood management and selective exposure."

A quantitative content analysis of the British form of televised political advertising, namely Party Election Broadcasts (PEBs) was carried out incorporating content and structural features that are deemed as to have an effect on viewers processing of audio-visual messages. In order to narrow the focus of the analysis party leader presentation was defined as the unit of analysis. The research found that party leaders presence in PEB has increased over time in all three parties, although there seem to be an indication that party politics might reverse this trend if needed. Party leaders are usually presented with a gesture of happiness. Features like music and emotional appeals have also increased their presence in PEBs."

In this paper, we present a methodology for analyzing the influence of these traits on Web users. We combine evidence from questionnaires, memory tests, and unobtrusive observation of navigation patterns to provide a comprehensive picture of user behavior. Our methodology is applicable to a wide range of Web phenomena, and enables researchers to develop more refined models of the psychological aspects of online information behavior. We also report results from an experiment which employs this methodology to examine the affective, cognitive and behavioral effects of NFC and NES."

Results show significant main effects of viewer gender such that when viewing ads that feature female nudity, male viewers react more favorably compared to females, whereas, when viewing male nudity, females react more favorably to the ad. The study findings support the opposite sex effect suggested in previous research. In addition, a significant interaction between viewer gender and degree of nudity on viewers responses to male nudity ads was found. Specifically, the opposite sex effect of ads containing male nudity could be found only with explicit nudity but not with suggestive nudity ads. Explanations for the results and practical implications of the study are further discussed."

Although some progress has been made in understanding how persuasive metaphors (of the A is B variety) may achieve their effects, comparatively little is known about how such metaphors are produced. This study attempts to fill this research gap by proposing that the construction of a persuasive metaphor involves search of a B with an appropriate valence to yoke with A. This search can proceed via three processes. First, as an attribute search process, where the search seeks a specific attribute with the appropriate valence and then selects the object or category as the base which has the attribute. Second, as an object or category search process, where the search seeks an object or category with the appropriate global valence and then selects it as the base. Third, as a mixed search process, where the search seeks an object or category with the appropriate global valence as well as an attribute with the appropriate valence and then selects a base that has both the desired global valence and the attribute. Results from a sentence completion task show most support for the second process."
2005-1126,Phenomenology and Technography: Theorizing How To Gather In A World Without Distance,New Media,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Phenomenology and Technography: Theorizing How To Gather In A World Without Distance,New Media,"This paper outlines of a theory applicable to mobile technology derived from Heideggers philosophy of technology. Contemporary technological mobility intensifies the problem Heidegger identifies in modern technology: the end of distance. Miniaturization, ubiquity and speed make traditional conceptual differentiations between humans and technology impossible to maintain. Time/Space compression and tele-presence are now staples in theorizations of technology and society, but these theories focus on situationality rather than de-distancing as an experience. Heidegger warns this approach continues to theorize humanity into the standing reserve of nature. In addition to elaborating how technologies are employed in everyday life, I suggest it is important to identify poetic dwelling, seizing technological crisis as an opportunity to find Heideggerian truth. The task is to identify rituals that give sacredness to the artifacts (Carey, 1989), and in the revealing of the ritual processes, unveil the experience of pure being itself. Technography as a method of qualitative inquiry in communications should take seriously the Latourian perspective that technological devices function as actants in the actor-network, holding things at a uniform distancelessness as per their programs. Technography should artfully represent and recreate experience, autoethnographically and dramaturgically, emphasizing the performance of culture even as we and our technologies participate in writing it. This paper fits the ICA theme Questioning the Dialogue by exploring the relationship of culture and technology through a dialogue of traditional and contemporary theoretical and philosophical discourses. (an earlier draft of this paper was presented at a nonacademic conference, the New Forms Festival 2004, Vancouver)"

The angle and distance chosen suggests attributes about the relationship between the subject and viewer that help the viewer to interpret the portrayal. An analysis of award-winning photographs found Presidents of the United States are most often portrayed at eye-level, suggesting a social relationship that allows citizens to relate personally to the President. The analysis found greater variety in the distance at which the President is photographed, suggesting the relationship between viewers and the President changes in different situations."

Focusing on discussions in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate leading up the the passing of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998), the concept of frames was used to examine the ways in which the metaphor was employed. It is argued that the use strongly encourages certain ways of perceiving the problem while discouraging others. Implications for the possibility of open and honest dialogue about information policy in legislative stages are discussed."
2005-1151,Play it Again Uncle Sam: Ritual and Imagination in American Dreams,Hopes and Dreams and Imagined Themes,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Play it Again Uncle Sam: Ritual and Imagination in American Dreams,Hopes and Dreams and Imagined Themes,"This paper examines the television show American Dreams. Through semiotic, textual, and narrative analysis, paired with what producers have said about the show, I argue that the show serves a nation-building function. Set in Philadelphia in the 1960s, the show focuses on the six-member Pryor family, the audience is meant to see the family as their prior American selves. Meg, the eldest daughter embodies the future of the nation. Just as Meg is eager and forward-looking, with a face so smooth and glowing it couldnt be any easier to look at, the history presented on American Dreams is infinitely digestible, relating well-known events as simply as possible, inserting pop songs from the era into the narrative to orient viewers to the emotions they should be feeling, and making use of authentic news and television footage to add authenticity and a sense of realness to the stories that are told. American Dreams, by playing retro media, using the audiences knowledge of how it all ends, and sympathetically portraying multiple perspectives, imagines a nation unified by history and emotion. The retelling of history on American Dreams serves a nation-building function; it is a retelling of a shared past that revisits tensions only to resolve them, letting viewers imagine not only a better America, but also an America in which they are members. This show, which premiered a year after the terrorist attacks of September 11, offers support to the American public by suggesting that Americas current state of anxiety is natural and tolerable."

Abstract
With a highly vertically-integrated structure of ownership now in place, media corporations are using their various subsidiaries and affiliates to cross-promote their diverse assets. Local television newscasts are important outlets for this practice, known as plugola. This paper examines how plugola inserts parent network programming into local station ""news"" in ways that appropriate public informational programming for commercial purposes. A general discussion of plugola is followed by a study of the Portland, Oregon television news market to show how even a city well regarded for its preservation of local identity and high level of civic engagement is subject in the neoliberal era to a growing commodification of news broadcasting."

In this study we examined how media and personal attitudes contribute to such an erroneous perception. We also examined the extent to which pluralistic ignorance might be related to college students sexual attitudes and the consequences of such a misperception.
The data for this paper came from a paper-and-pencil survey involving 312 college students. The results indicate widespread evidence of pluralistic ignorance. Students believed that friends and the average student on campus were more sexually permissive than themselves. We found that college students form such erroneous impressions of peers according to their estimate of possible media effects on peers and their own sexual attitudes. These misperceptions were found to produce a significant impact on the male college student and to make him more likely to engage in sexual activity at an earlier stage in dating."

Data for analysis are chosen on the grounds that, first, they are not presented baldly to sell products, but adopt the rhetorical strategies of repetition, parallelism, name and metaphor, producing poetic effects and somehow literary. Secondly, poetic effects, like other tropes, would arouse more attention of the audience, serving a site where the weaker effects of communication of feelings, attitudes and impressions could be more implicated than by literal forms of expressions. Thirdly, they are ideologically significant for conveying such appeals and frames as intellectualism, elitism, nostalgia, friends' rapport, feminine awakening, humanistic concern, and those current lifestyles of petits bourgeois. Placing quite little emphasis on the target commodity -- books, they encourage an imaginative audience to spell out a variety of weak implicatures along these lines, fairly invisibly persuading her to recognize the prominent values. Also they help shape Eslite's corporate image as a cultural landmark, thus keeping the dialectical relationship between social structures and social practice/discourse.
Relevance framework (Sperber & Wilson 1995) is applied to reexamine the speaker-audience relationship in communication by looking into five captions released by Eslite Bookstore. The sociocultural aspect of language use, on the other hand, is further explored to see the inseparable relationship between language and social function. This functional linguistic study reveals that the selling motive could well be melted and/or hidden through such a communication strategy due to its implicitness, indirectness and vagueness."

This paper fits in the media economics tradition within communication science, with a strong focus on how market structures and behavior of market players influence the performance of media markets. As the market for digital educational content is still in an embryonic state, I conducted a scenario exercise to investigate how different forms of governmental policy could influence the structure, conduct and ultimately performance of the market for digital educational content. Based on interviews with publishers of digital educational content and representatives from governmental organizations engaged in ICT and education, four scenarios are proposed. These scenarios detail how different forms of public funding and market standardization could influence the production of digital educational content for primary and secondary education."

A Study of the Priming of the Media Frames of the President in the Public Mind,Cognitive Effects of the Mass Media,"This study content analyzed a leading Korean newspaper to examine the different framing of the 14th and 16th presidents. The news stories of the presidents were analyzed in terms of topics, sources, title of the presidents, and the content of presidential quotations. The results were compared with two polls. As a result, the 16th president, represented more with the politics frame, had a lower approval rating in terms of his negative personal characteristics as a politician, while the 14th president with the policy frame was evaluated in light of his policies. The study discusses the idea that media framing effect occurs when its framing devices are primed in the publics political judgment."
2005-1157,Political Discussion and Democratic Citizenship: Comparing Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Political Discussion as Promoters of Active Citizenry,Communication and Citizenship Revisited,Political Communication,,,Paper,Political Discussion and Democratic Citizenship: Comparing Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Political Discussion as Promoters of Active Citizenry,Communication and Citizenship Revisited,"Political communication scholars have put forward contrasting theories and produced contradictory evidence in attempts to explain the impact of heterogeneity of political discussion on active citizenship. However, most of these studies examined the effects of heterogeneous discussion independently of homogenous discussion. This is overly simplistic, of course, given that most citizens are likely to be mobilized through discussion with both likeminded and non-likeminded discussion partners. This study examines the opposing claims on the civic consequences of heterogeneous political discussion empirically and directly compares the influence of heterogeneous and homogeneous political discussion on indicators of active citizenship. Overall, two general findings emerged. First, heterogeneous political discussion does encourage democratic citizenship and, second, heterogeneous political discussion and homogeneous political discussion have different effects on indicators of active citizenship."

Some have considered such blogs as a new form of alternative journalism. This study draws on agenda-setting theory to examine coverage within the top eleven political news blogs of the nine candidates vying for the Democratic party nomination to run in the 2004 U.S. presidential election leading up to the Iowa caucuses on January 19, 2004. Blog coverage was compared to a random sample of mainstream newspaper coverage using content analysis, and to popularity of candidates with the public using results from a national public opinion poll. Supporting past agenda-setting studies, a correlation was found between candidate popularity and newspaper coverage of candidates. However, contrary to the studys hypotheses, the findings suggest that the more popular a candidate, the more coverage a candidate receives in political news blogs as well, to a similar extent as newspapers. The amount of candidate coverage in the studys sample of blogs and newspapers is highly correlated, as is the valence of coverage. Both political news blog and newspaper coverage of candidates is predominated by horserace-type content. These findings suggest that the top political news blogs hold stark similarities to mainstream newspaper coverage of elections. Agenda-setting appears to be a relevant framework within which to address these relationships. Follow-up studies are recommended to further examine how political news blogs can be seen as representing private views of members of the public, while also reflecting influences of mainstream media."

For many feminist critics, however, the entry of feminism into the popular culture has not been unproblematic. Some critics say that images of liberated women are mainly connected with commercial interests, and feminist discourse is incorporated in dominant patriarchal ideology in popular culture. By examining two television dramas Lovers and The Woman Next Door, which were produced before and after 1997, a turning point in popular feminism in South Korea, I intend to explore the role of popular culture in forming feminist discourse and incorporating feminist discourse in dominant patriarchal ideology. Main argument is that although popular culture, reflecting social change, delivers resistant feminist discourses, they are constantly reinscribed in dominant patriarchal ideology through various strategies."

The examination included the detailed deconstruction of two exemplars  a household and business advertisement.
Research found that Nigerian mass media advertisements including advertising material used to promote the household product under analysis did resort to the use of gender and sex stereotypes. Other advertisements including the business-oriented advertisement was ambiguous in that it showed women in professional setting, however it did also contain stereotypical hints. On the basis of these findings, the study suggests that as the society of African nations changes the role of women within those nations is also evolving."

All shows in the sample included romantic partners; most often these partners were married or dating Caucasian adults. Results show that conflict is found in less than half of romantic relationships and is most frequently initiated by the female partner who attributes the cause to the male partner. Female characters engage in distributive conflict resolution behaviors (e.g., patronizing comments, chastisement, defensive actions) while men engage in integrative behaviors (e.g., apologizing, changing behavior). The problem is almost always solved by the end of the show."

Time/Space Articulations of Eastern European Media Landscapes,tertextual Narratives of Time and Space,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Portraying the Media Landscape. Time/Space Articulations of Eastern European Media Landscapes,Intertextual Narratives of Time and Space,"In the last couple of years there has been an increased interest in emphasising the spatial aspects of the media, metaphorically by painting pictures of electronic landscapes, dominated by electronic empires. The importance of the media for shaping our perceptions and use of space is naturally not new, but was already discussed by Marshall McLuhan in the early 1960s, in metaphors like the geographical revolution and the global village. However, space cannot easily be understood apart from time, which seems obvious when seen against the societal changes (including those in the media systems) the last couple of decades have witnessed in Western as well as Eastern Europe.
This paper is an attempt at contributing to the discussion on the spatiality of the media, taking its start in the concept of media landscape and relating it to spatial as well as temporal aspects of the media. The examples to this discussion is taken from an ongoing research project dealing with the changes in the media systems of Eastern Europe, and relating these to the changes occurring also in Western Europe."

An experimental design is employed to explore the links between perceptions of threat, media dependency relations for achievement of goals of social and self understanding as well as social and self orientation, and public agenda. Perceived threat is manipulated through the use of newspaper content. Five hypotheses are posed linking the foregoing variables pairwise. While the results of the data analysis from this initial exploratory study did not provide the anticipated results supporting the key hypotheses, the discussion of the results and the limitations of the study is instructive in preparation of a follow-up study scheduled for the beginning of 2005."
2005-1164,Power of Romances: Voices For and Against the Serbian Regime,Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,Feminist Scholarship,,,Works in Progress,Power of Romances: Voices For and Against the Serbian Regime,Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,"The aim of this paper is to present bipolarization in Serbian pulp-fiction literature during the regime of ex-Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic and to depict the ways in which some women writers, commonly known as love-story authoress, expressed their subtle or open dis/agreement with the political situation in the country. During the 1990s, Milosevic's politics were based on revival and return of national heritage which included, among other issues, representation of other Balkan peoples as frightening Others, an emphasis on the role of a man in society, and the imposition of the attitude that the country can live and make progress without relying on or dealing with the West or other countries in the region. Writers who included that agenda in their works were praised by the regime in television commercials, public advertisements, and interviews in high-circulation dailies/ magazines. The fact that most of the books by these writers were bestsellers can be interpreted as a specific way of women confirming and/or resisting Milosevics power.
For instance, Ljiljana Habjanovic-Djurovic in her novels *Ana Marija me nije volela* (Ana Maria Did Not Love Me) and *Zenski rodoslov* (Feminine Genealogy) repeat the stereotypes imposed by the regime. For instance, in the first book a husband leaves the main character, a Serbian orthodox rural woman, for a Catholic woman from the capital of Croatia. The differences include clothes, make up, way of speech, and cooking abilities, but in all cases the Catholic woman is presented as a harmful and alienated (Western) Other."

This paper aims to present and discuss the key findings of a research project conducted during 2004 into stakeholder perceptions of public relations education in the UK. Quantitative and qualitative data is presented and discussed on the structure of curriculum and specifically the balance of theory and practice. Employer perceptions are analysed to understand their views and occasional contradictions. For example on the one hand employers perceive public relations education as over theoretical and lacking practical application; on the other, it is blamed for failing to instil the analytical flexibility found in non-PR graduates. The paper concludes with discussion and recommendations for the future of public relations education in the UK context.

Federal appellate Judge Richard A. Posner has been one of the most-published and most-cited proponents of legal pragmatism, which he suggests is tied to reasonableness and free of a reliance on abstract theories and philosophies about the Constitution and democracy. But how does this philosophy work in practice? This paper attempts to answer that question by examining two of Judge Posners opinions in press-clause cases. The paper concludes that pragmatism may be beneficial to press defendants in tort actions if the press can show that the good it did in the public interest is greater than any harm it caused. However, pragmatism may work against the press in journalists privilege cases in which the press must rely on moralistic claims about the value of a free press."

However, these associations represent a practical problem in that their examination is dependent on behavioral assessment and thus can only be applied to relationships in progress. This study sought to gain predictive power regarding relational outcomes by integrating need fulfillment and compatibility. Data collected from 91 couples involved in exclusive romantic relationships were used to examine interpersonal need compatibility (the extent to which partners pursued similar levels of affection, inclusion, and control fulfillment) as a determinant of satisfaction. Results demonstrated that interpersonal need compatibility possesses significant associations with need fulfillment and relationship satisfaction, but that these associations are more complex than originally predicted."

The online medium, a hybrid of multiple communication technologies, offers a multitude of communication functions, including marketing. As a marketing communication channel, the Internet has attracted nearly one-third of its users to try online shopping during the decade when it became commercialized. Yet online marketing remains an alternative instead of a primary outlet for consumer product distribution, due to privacy and security concerns associated with electronic transactions.

This study intends to examine the factors that can help explain why Internet users choose to shop online. A random telephone survey yielded 281 valid responses from among Internet users. Study findings reveal that user motives, individual innovativeness and online-use frequency were strong predictors for online shopping behavior. By contrast, off-line teleshopping activity, online-use repertoire or user demographics were insignificant predictors."
2005-1170,Predicting Political Attention as an Allocation of Limited Mental Resources,The Influence of Mood and Attention on Political Messages,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,Predicting Political Attention as an Allocation of Limited Mental Resources,The Influence of Mood and Attention on Political Messages,"This study tests the idea that the two predictors, partisan consistency and schematic consistency of a message, affect the resources allocated to the processing of the political information. In general, it is expected that unfavorable messages against their own partisan orientation are more likely to be processed with less resources to be allocated. Also, schematic consistency is expected to affect political information processing in such a way that person/issue schema drive attention to schema consistent information, having people allocate more resources to it. Schema in general is explained to guide attention, and partisan bias to affect the acceptance, or storage, of political messages (Lodge & Hamill, 1986; Zaller, 1992; Garramone et al., 1991). Although these explanations were provided under theoretical contexts other than resource allocation, both partisanship and political schema as stored constructs are hypothesized to affect allocation policies in the subsequent loops of information processing. Heart rates (HR), secondary task reaction time (STRT), recognition, and free recall are used to measure the allocated resources. Low HR, slow STRT, more recognition and free recall are assumed to indicate more resource allocation."

This increase in the amount of monitoring has generated research regarding the impact of this monitoring on employees. This study extends current research related to employee information monitoring and examines the monitoring of employee communication, and in particular, from a social identify theory (SIT) perspective examines how the relationship between employees attachment to their organization impacts their perceptions about monitoring, workplace communication, their job, and several important organizational outcomes. People from both public and private organizations (N = 386) completed measures of organizational identification, perceived monitoring appropriateness, perceived amount of monitoring, perceived communication privacy, organizational relations, job satisfaction, intent to leave, and communication adequacy. From a SIT perspective, the results signal a shift in beliefs toward monitoring appropriateness to align with the organizations position on the issue to maintain consistency of beliefs. These results are interpreted within the theoretical context of the study, and directions for future research and implications for practice are emphasized."

An online survey of college student IM users (N=443) was conducted to examine the role of three important conceptsgratifications sought (GS), gratifications obtained (GO), and social presencein the context of IM use.
Results indicate that 1) College students used IM to seek fulfillment of social utility, interpersonal utility, convenience, entertainment/relaxation, and information needs and did so successfully through IM use. The two most salient gratifications (both sought and obtained) were convenience and social utility. 2) Social presence was positively and significantly related to GS and GO. The mediating role of social presence suggested that the relationship between GS and GO depends on the extent to which college students feel a sense of being together. 3) The convenience motive, followed by the entertainment/relaxation motive and the convenience benefit were the strongest predictors of IM use. 4) Both GS and GO were influenced by social presence and GS had a direct effect on IM use, while GO had an indirect effect.
Implications for extending uses and gratifications and social presence theory and research are discussed."

focused on examining the salience of online reputation in electronic
commerce. More importantly, it introduced a new methodological
approach to scholarly investigation of online auctions and electronic
commerce in general. Succinctly, this study utilized a power law model
based on preferential attachment (Barabasi & Albert, 1999) to
investigate how the aggregate feedback score influences the
probability of a sale on eBay. The model was tested using empirical
data collected from 1541 randomly selected eBay members. The findings
indicated that consumer-buying preference is largely dependent upon
seller reputation on eBay, and further suggested that the aggregate
feedback score is indeed an effective communication contrivance of
online reputation in electronic commerce."

Past research has demonstrated positive associations between image quality and presence and video game technology and presence, the perceptual illusion of nonmediation (Lombard & Ditton, 1997). No study to date, however, has examined the presence effects of video games played in high definition, something likely to become very common in the future as both technologies diffuse into homes. This paper reports the results of an experimental study in which 22 college students played a video game either in high definition (high image quality) or standard definition/NTSC (low image quality) and then completed several measures of presence and a measure of video game skill. Skill was included as a second independent variable in the study, and both image quality and skill were expected to relate positively to presence dimensions. The results of the study provide some support for both image quality and skill affecting presence, though not all results were in the direction expected. These findings are discussed along with suggestions for future research."

Social injustice is more of concern in environmental activism in the developing world. This study examines four years of news coverage in both countries to determine if those concerns are still reflected in the news coverage of environmental issues. This paper uses contextual analysis to analyze coverage of hydroelectric projects in two Indian newspapers (The Times of India and The Hindu) and two U.S. newspapers (The New York Times and The Buffalo News) in the environmental cultural context of their respective countries. Environmental activism was measured by examining the power of news stories to invite public participation. Using Bartons classification of news formats, presence of disjunctive news format was considered an indication of newspapers emphasis on citizen involvement.
The study demonstrates that there is a marked difference in the way environmental activism, as it relates to the hydroelectric projects is covered in the United States and in India. Some of the key findings of the study are: 1) environmental activism appeared more potent in the Indian newspapers than their U.S. counterparts, 2) Disjunctive news formats, which create a sense of discontent and therefore potentially invite public participation were much more prevalent in the Indian newspapers. 3) The coverage of hydroelectric controversy in the US newspapers was much more complacent and seemed to discourage public participation."

Bush (February, 2001  August, 2003). Employing time series regression analysis, we traced factors impacting President Bushs attention on four primary issues -- war, economy, domestic and foreign issues. Our data revealed that President Bush tried to focus on the economy and domestic issues during the wartime. Notably, the president turned more attention to domestic issues as his approval rate decreased. The wag-the-dog Hypothesis also is supported in the finding that the president focused on the war issue more when the employment rate increased. The presidential attention to the four issues did not have influence on his popularity, except for the war issue, which, however, had a negative effect on presidential popularity."

Specifically, it explores the online medias agenda-setting effects on five different attributes of the global warming issue, and the effects influence on peoples shaping their own evaluative dimension relative to the issue. By exposing three groups of subjects, respectively, to three kinds of online newspaper (High, Medium and No Exposure) stimuli, the experiment attempts to determine (1) if there are attribute agenda setting effects in the digital era, and (2) if the attribute salience transfer affects the priming effects. The rank order correlations between the stimuli and the subjects opinion on the attributes after the exposure to the stimuli support the attribute agenda setting effects of the online newspaper. Additionally, regression analyses show the association between the attribute salience transfer and the priming effects."

Undergraduate students (N = 278) at a large public university were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions (outgroup contrast, ingroup counter-stereotyping, and control). Only the outgroup contrast message strategy was effective in activating collective identity and reducing perceived social distance from ingroup members. Results suggest that, as hypothesized, activating subjects collective identity resulted in decreased misperceptions about group members normative behavior. In addition, this debiasing strategy resulted in more favorable evaluations of the accuracy of social information about the true distribution of members behavior. On the other hand, there was no evidence of effect on behavioral intentions. Implications for future research and intervention strategies are discussed."

In addition, the moderating effect of news exposure, political ideology, sex and race were also assessed. Findings indicated that exposure to crime stories in which the majority of the suspects were identified as Black increased whether participants believed a separate unidentified suspect was culpable for his alleged offense. Furthermore, findings also suggest that participants of color and women are more likely to view the world as a dangerous place. Finally, conservatives and whites were more likely to support law enforcement officials compared to people of color and liberals. The methodological and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."

The concept of privacy has changed in recent years from one that required due process to breach our privacy to one that assumes guilt even with evidence of innocence. Among the many difficulties with our new and perhaps not so improved privacy laws is their lack of uniformity in application, especially with respect to technology. Our government strictly watches over our use of some technologies with no obligation to inform of their doing so, but overlook others with equally if not more capability of compromising our countrys safety. This paper will examine two technologies with near identical capabilities yet with two entirely different standards for infringement of privacy, wireless laptops and wireless phones."

We argue that in addition to institutional structures that differ between the two jurisdictions of Hong Kong and Ontario, differing cultural notions of privacy tend to affect the acceptance of new information and communication technologies (ICTs). For our comparison, we focus on one potentially privacy-invasive technology, smart cards, and discuss the factors that contribute to their adoption and use in the two regions selected, including ones conceptualization of digital identity and privacy, and the role of consultation and public debate."
2005-1202,Privacy and Surveillance in Interactive Television: The Case of the TiVo Digital Video Recorder,Privacy and Communication Technology,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Privacy and Surveillance in Interactive Television: The Case of the TiVo Digital Video Recorder,Privacy and Communication Technology,"Privacy and surveillance studies must expand to reflect the growing number of sites where new digital, networked technologies combine with existing technologies. The paper proposes that television is an important developing site for examining this intermeshing. Even though the industry has remained stable for half a century, the introduction of a two-way flow of information raises novel questions for both the industry and for communication researchers. To make this argument, the contours of interactive television are explored. The TiVo digital video recorder is than presented as a detailed case study in both the application of surveillance technology in television as well as the promotion of the ethic of surveillance-based models as the future norm. Implications of this shift are discussed in the context of the literature of surveillance."

Queer studies can offer surveillance studies a theoretical perspective on the social consequences of those practices. Together, they offer a framework for the analysis of infrastructures of identity and visibility. Research should focus on how infrastructures permit individuals to claim an identity within a social context, and how they enable subcultures to generate knowledge. Not restricted to techniques, analysis should include the institutional adoption of techniques, to expose, demystify, and appropriate the mechanisms that produce social truth."

The series celebrates the sophisticated tastes and make-over prowess of a quintet of self-identified gay men: the Fab Five. From a queer theory perspective, there is much to celebrate about Queer Eyes openly gay stars and their easy fraternization with straight men. Still, there are reasons for critical concern. We interrogate the series as an expression of the strategic rhetoric of straightness that hides and supports the very heteronormative order it seems to challenge. We argue that, as such, the series functions as a mediated ritual of rebellion in which gays are given temporary license to tame, touch, and tease heterosexual men, violating norms governing appropriate male behavior. And yet, even while this popular culture text challenges heteronormative hegemony, ultimately, we contend, Queer Eye strategically serves to domesticate queers and contain queer sexuality."

The first section of this paper clarifies what is meant by a multi-layered definition of the public interest. The remaining sections look specifically at the layers of meaning within the public interest standard, especially those layers of process and principle. In comparing various theoretical viewpoints, the author recommends a participatory process as the preferred method for identifying and applying public interest principles. The ultimate goal of the examination is to discover ways to increase public participation in the ongoing dialogue regarding media policy."

The purpose of this manuscript was to examine the effects of visual and audio modalities on viewers attention and retention of information contained in political advertising. Results of a 2 (positive video/negative audio vs. negative video/positive audio) X 2 (video-only or audio-only) X 6 (number of each message type/cue sequence exposure during attention) X 4 (4 exposure sequences) indicated that participants had higher rates of attention for visual information than for audio information. While there was no difference in the amount of visual versus audio information participants retained from the ad stimuli, they did recall more negative information than positive information from the political advertising."

The study found quite a change in recent public relations scholarship: Many new names were found in productive author and program categories. Glen T. Cameron and Maureen Taylor were the most productive authors and University of Georgia, Rutgers University, University of Houston, and University of Missouri ranked as top institutions in terms of productivity. Academicians wrote most of the public relations articles and academicians-professionals together wrote about 10 percent of articles. Female authors comprised almost half of all public relations authors."

The professional community in other nations (e.g., Italy, Puerto Rico, Venezuela) is exploring a sort of legislation. This paper documents the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations law through interviews of eleven top-level professionals. These professionals believe that: (a) the law has enhanced the prestige and legitimacy of the profession; (b) the registration process is inefficient, therefore, it should be decentralized; (c) there is low public awareness about the NIPR law, which is partly responsible for widespread violation of the law by both government and private organizations; and (d) the situation would have been worse without the law, therefore, it should be maintained, yet revised to keep up with the professions dynamic nature and publicized in order to increase compliance. Even though the law was enacted by the military, the respondents think that it would have been possible but difficult to do so under the current democratic dispensation."

In a world where increasing corporate power and presence have lead to widespread protest and debate, corporations realize the potential profitability that comes with having a good social and environmental image. In this paper I will look at one specific case of this phenomenon: the Shell Oil Profits and Principles public relations campaign, launched in 1998. I will use methods of critical discourse analysis to argue that this type of discourse cooptation serves a more significant purpose than merely improving a corporations image; that it in fact serves the broader project of economic liberalization and reinforcement of hegemonic ideas by couching globalist projects, not only in powerful and deceitful language, but specifically in the language of its enemies. The first part of this paper involves a theoretical discussion of the notion of globalization, the field of critical discourse analysis, and the methodology I use. The second part analyzes in depth three of the campaigns advertisements. I conclude by posing some questions concerning the impact of campaigns such as this on the anti-globalization movement."
2005-1210,Programmed Escape? Avoidance Processes in TV-Program Choices,The Gratifying Media,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Programmed Escape? Avoidance Processes in TV-Program Choices,The Gratifying Media,"Communication scientists typically regard exposure to TV programs as an approach process, with audiences using TV for uses and gratification purposes. To this effect, channels get changed until individuals have optimized their program choice. Less attention, however, has been given to avoidance processes during TV exposure. Our essay discusses TV exposure from such a perspective in that it conceives of changing programs as a reactive damage minimization strategy. Drawing from the classical gratification discrepancy model, we present an escape model that is based on relevant psychological research on cognitions and emotions. Results from an empirical study support the escape model by showing that experience of negative emotions (repulsion, despondency / distance loss, anger, compassion stress, boredom, anxiety, shame and lack of authenticity) can be understood as reasons for program escape. The data also showed that avoidance behavior is influenced by the personality structure of the audience. The paper discusses the implications of these findings and makes suggestions for future research."

An Analysis of Mediation from the Perspective of Feminist Legal Theory,Theorizing the Feminine,"This paper examines mediation as it pertains to alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and as an alternative to adjudication. It discusses the current form that mediation takes in ADR and demonstrates how mediation merely presents another forum for men to exert power over women. I assert the lack of formal rules and standards in current mediation practice do not protect women from the power imbalance inherent in modern society in the United States, but can in fact make that imbalance even more pronounced. This prepares the way for coercion in the realm of dispute resolution, and can have the effect of denying rights to women that would protect them under the current laws."

It also sought to determine if individual differences in need for cognition moderated such an effect. A 2 (high need for cognition vs low need for cognition) x 2 (high interactivity vs low interactivity) factorial design was used to test the hypotheses. Two sites with the same content were designed with different levels of interactivity and randomly assigned to 445 undergraduate students (aged 18-27) at a Southeastern university. Results show a non-significant main effect for interactivity on comprehension, and a significant main effect for need for cognition (p < .05) holding reading style constant. Results also show a significant effect of interactivity on attitude towards site (p < .01), with the high interactivity group displaying more positive attitudes. The results suggest that while level of interactivity does not affect comprehension, it has a positive impact on whether people are attracted to and will continue to pay attention to a website. The implications and suggestions for future analyses are also given."

Extended periods away from spouses and committed sexual partners, high stress environments, disposal income and mobility create a combination of pressures and opportunity that expose military personnel to high-risk situations. In East Africa, the nations of Tanzania and Kenya have launched aggressive campaigns among their military to address the critical health problem of HIV and AIDS. In this paper we explain the military effort in Kenya to influence military personnel through an entertainment-education film and document some of the results of this effort. We also discuss the lessons health educators and government leaders have learned through theses experiences and the implications of these experiences on future entertainment-education theory and research."

Although the current Sino-American copyright dispute is presented like a morality play between the evil Chinese pirates and the genius of American authors, the historical examination shows that on the one hand the U.S. is in no position to claim such moral superiority, while on the other hand different countries should design their copyright legislation according to specific economic, political and cultural contexts rather than adopting one universal standard of copyright regime. The first part of this paper is a retrospective analysis of how the early U.S. copyright statute dealt with the copyright of foreign works and what the rationales were behind the discrimination against foreign authors rights. I then discussed the treatment of foreign works in the Chinese copyright law and argued that such treatment was under strong influence of the hegemonic power that the U.S. had established in the arena of international copyright. In the conclusion part of this paper, I draw together the two historical accounts to further criticize the impracticability and injustice in the current trend of the harmonization of international copyright."

This article proposes that deliberation and deliberative processes define the public relations practice of a democratizing nation such as Singapore. We posit that as a country becomes more democratic, deliberation also becomes a more prominent feature of government public relations. Using quantitative content analysis, this study evaluated 37 National Day speeches delivered by three Singaporean Prime Ministers on the occasion of Singapores National Day. Our findings show that as the Singaporean political leadership moves away from a top-down approach and towards a more participatory style of government, the frames found in the speeches emphasize greater public participation and engagement in public debate on issues that shape the countrys future. As it emphasizes equal opportunity for citizens to speak and be heard, this model of government public relations moves away from the traditional public information model and approaches a two-way symmetrical model."

Universities,Public Relations Top Student Papers,Public Relations,,,Paper,Public Relations Function in a Higher Education Setting: An Examination of Communication Management in Two Eastern U. S. Universities,Public Relations Top Student Papers,This study uses the Excellence theory of public relations to examine how two Eastern U. S. universities practice public relations. The characteristics of excellent public relations identified in the Excellence theory provide a useful benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of the public relations function. Few studies have used the Excellence theory to examine how public relations is practiced in a higher education setting. Results from the study indicate that the two public relation units did not completely exhibit the excellence characteristics. This study provides recommendations on how the two public relations units can achieve excellence.

Because of its history and an increase in the influx of foreigners to the city especially in the 1920s and 1930s, it became one of the most cosmopolitan cites in China. This study investigates the nature of public relations practices among a sample of different types of organizations in this cosmopolitan city that is leading Chinas explosive economic growth.
A combination of quantitative (self-administered survey) and qualitative methods (in-depth interviews) was used to gather data for this study from 23 organizations (government agencies, non-profits, and corporations  domestic and multinational).
The personal influence model was found to be the most prevalent model in all the organizations based on personal networking (Guanxi) due to Chinas relation-centric culture. Relationship with the media was less valued particularly amongst government agencies and state owned enterprises. Contrary to published literature, the public information model was least used by government agencies and non-profit organizations in the sample. Multinational corporations practiced the two-way asymmetrical or symmetrical model more often than domestic organizations.
The lun zi pai bei system (valuing seniority over performance or qualifications), which had not been discussed at all in PR literature, showed that heads of PR departments of government agencies often had no education or even background in public relations. As a result, railway workers and even chefs were asked to head public relations departments!"
2005-1218,Quality Assessment of Television Programs: Can Viewers Recognize Production Value?,Back in the Newsroom,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Quality Assessment of Television Programs: Can Viewers Recognize Production Value?,Back in the Newsroom,"Television programs' production value is highly regarded by professionals as a crucial dimension of program quality, but was never examined from viewers' perspective. This study examines the degree to which viewers are sensitive to television programs' production value as a distinct evaluative dimension, their ability to pass educated judgements of production value, and its impact on their overall program appreciation and quality assessment. Based on a large-scale survey among television viewers in Israel, we find that production value makes up a distinct evaluative dimension, indicating that viewers are sensitive to production considerations. Production value assessments also explain television program appreciation and quality evaluations. On the other hand, there are indications that lay viewers are not very good at discerning gradations of production value among different programs and genres. These findings have direct implications on policy-oriented recommendations as to the role of viewers' quality judgments vis-à-vis experts' assessments."

In an experiment college students (the target demographic) rated the sexiness of 12 ads and then responded to a series of questions regarding attitudes toward the ad and the brand, product recall, and purchase intent. The study design incorporated both gender and race as independent variables. The results provide a an interesting picture of the interaction of sexy ads, gender, and race with interactions. The findings include interactions between sexiness of the ad and gender predicting attitudes towards the ads, between race and predicting recall, and gender and predicting purchasing intentions. Both the theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

From a number of open issues, twelve issues were selected to study the level of agreement between the two countries' general public (i.e. the degree to which the two sides share similar evaluation of each issue), accuracy of one side's assessment of the other side's opinions (i.e. the degree to which the assessment of Croatian citizens about the opinions of Slovenia's citizens agrees with the actual opinion of Slovenia's citizens, and vice versa), and the degree of congruency of either side's opinions with the responses they have predicted for the other side."

This paper looks at the role of discourse in the human relationship to animals by going beyond the widely accepted premise that humans lack critical awareness of their roles in the discourses that reinforce their own subordination. This paper takes the next step in discursive theory by focusing on the discourse by which people structure, discipline, and often subordinate nonhuman animals lives. Using critical discourse analysis to analyze transcripts of recordings of visitors and officials at a modern day American zoo, this paper focuses on both institutional and visitor discourse about zoo animals to illuminate the strategic action of discourses that construct the human relationship to other animals. In addition, this paper looks at subtle and not so subtle discursive resistances as they exhibit other worldviews or consciousnesses in regard to the human-animal-nature relationship. This paper also looks at how these resistances might be discursively policed via institutional discourse at the zoo."

Traditional forms of teaching and learning are increasingly being converted to online and virtual environments. This paper is a critical analysis with reference to the changes taking place in teaching and learning process and the role that ICTs have played in this transformation. The study focus on three aspects concerning the impact of ICTs on teaching and learning at a Mexican higher institution: the role of the instructor, in the way students learn, and the impact of ICTs use in HES themselves. The paper examines these aspects using a case study approach drawing on data obtained from in-depth interviews, documentary materials and observations. The paper argues that, while the use of ICTs plays an important role in bringing about changes at the institutional level, other factors such as the use of innovative pedagogic techniques, instructors and students willingness to change traditional ways of teaching and learning, and instructors and students training for working with technologies are also crucial. The research adds to the body of literature that considers the conditions under which the potential of the new technologies can be realized in a developing country."

The intent was to go beyond the old-and-tired polarization between qualitative and quantitative and to build a bridge in which borrowings from each approach remained true to their origins without homogenization. In shorthand, the purpose of the study was primarily one of methodological engagement. For this study, the qualitative borrowings involved a set of assumptions regarding the nature of in-depth phenomenologically-based interviewing and explicit attention to soliciting gratification namings in terms of phenomenological depths. The research question became, thus, how did the naming of seven gratifications (drawn from the literature) vary by channel and phenomenological depth. The interviews for the study were executed by students in an in-depth interviewing class at a large public university using interviews conducted on themselves and their friends and relatives. Sample n was 56 with each respondent coded for three gratification depths for each of five channels -- television, newspaper, radio, book, and interpersonal contact. A factorial analysis of variance tested for channel, depth, subject, and channel x depth interactions. Results both mirrored former uses and gratifications studies and opened up windows for examining the complex interplay of media/channels in everyday life. Conclusions pointed to a rich array of alternative entry points for advancing the uses and gratifications research tradition."

While both professions reported their experience of the behavioral conflicts in the relationship, they demonstrated discrepancies in experiences of grant privilege to the other profession, promise material support, give additional assistance and other experiences related to confer behaviors. Public relations practitioners reported confer events in the source-reporter relationship more than did journalists. This study confirms the perceived conflicts of public relations professionals and journalists through their behavioral conflicts and reflects that journalists do not tend to admit the information subsidy function of public relations practitioners."

By applying Freirean concepts of dialogic communication, problem-posing and empowerment, the present paper analyzes the case of a comprehensive rural health project (CRHP) in Jamkhed, India, which is looked upon by many as an exemplar of community-based health and development. This analysis is guided by one-and-a half months of intensive field work in Jamkhed and a dozen surrounding villages. This paper relies on observational data and 32 interviews with the participants who were either CRHP staff members or Jamkhed villagers actively involved in the community-based health project."

Recent uses of technologies of information and communication for collective action appear in some instances to violate these two tenets. In order to explain these, we reconceptualize collective action as a phenomenon of boundary-crossing between private and public domains. We show how a reconceptualized theory of collective action can better account for certain contemporary phenomena, and we situate traditional collective action theory as a special case of our expanded theory."

With the proposed coviewing types, this study also seeks to find out how the two types of coviewing vary in frequency and relationship with other variables as the content differs."
2005-1229,(Re)Considering Communitarianism: Choosing and Applying a Radical Alternative to News Coverage,Community and Civic Life,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,(Re)Considering Communitarianism: Choosing and Applying a Radical Alternative to News Coverage,Community and Civic Life,"More than a decade after the book Good News: Social Ethics and the Press proposed a radical departure from conventional journalism, communitarianism remains an understated and misunderstood voice in the contemporary debate about press ethics theories. Communitarianism has been posited at the foundation of the public/civic journalism movement, which has both boosters and detractors. This paper goes beyond a debate about public/civic journalism to return to the original conception of communitarianism as a normative press ethic. By analyzing value-laden choices of language and representation in a case study of one ongoing newspaper story over a period of nine months, I explore whether and how communitarianism might apply to specific news coverage. The resulting critique suggests how a truly communitarian press might provide an alternative coverage that focuses more on ethical considerations and less on the amoral craft conventions of traditional journalism."
2005-1230,Recruiters and Realistic Previews: Perceptions of Importance and Practice,Anticipatory Socialization and Recruitment,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Recruiters and Realistic Previews: Perceptions of Importance and Practice,Anticipatory Socialization and Recruitment,"Recent research suggests that realistic previews given to job candidates reduce voluntary turnover and increases their performance and job satisfaction. Yet, the extent that recruiters share realistic previews and influences on those previews remains unclear. This investigation explores linkages between extant research knowledge and recruiters reported behaviors. Approximately 100 collegiate recruiters reported their patterns of sharing realistic information, the source of their job information, the timing of realistic previews, and their interview training. Findings reveal that recruiters in this sample share more realistic information than recruitment literature suggests, share realistic information in a manner that reflects their beliefs, and largely present realistic information early in the recruiting process (e.g., information session, on-campus interview). Limitations of the research and future directions are discussed."
2005-1231,Recursive Regulatory Model for Technology,Theorizing Technologys Impact on Communication and Policy,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,Recursive Regulatory Model for Technology,Theorizing Technologys Impact on Communication and Policy,"The notion that code serves as a form of regulation is widely recognized in the scholarship on information technologies (Lessig 1999). However, the theoretical understanding of technology as a form of regulation is immature. This paper presents a model, the Recursive Regulatory Model for Technology (RRMT), for understanding how technology regulates. This model is largely inspired by Giddens structuration theory with some insights from Actor-Network Theory. It theorizes how technology develops, evolves, and acts as a regulatory mechanism. Specifically, RRMT focuses on the role of institutions in the development of technology, how technology affects individuals, how individuals reconfigure technology, and how individuals can influence the development of technology. The model is illustrated by examining the evolution of cookies technology. The cookies technology allows web sites to maintain information on their users, and therefore, has implications for privacy. In sum, RRMT is a model capable of assessing technologies as well as showing how technology can be used proactively as a regulator."

While changes in format consolidation and general programming have been well-documented, the implications for local radio news have not been studied as extensively. This paper utilizes data from field research in a small radio market to examine issues related to news values and decision-making when such choices are taken out of a local context. It compares the content of news produced in that local market to newscasts produced for that city from a corporate newsroom almost 300 miles away. Broader issues about the meaning of news in a community are also examined in the context of cultural geography and sense of place literature."

Though western democracies have had a long-standing tradition of investigative reporting and muckraking, such efforts were nearly absent until recently in India. However, in March 2001 a non-traditional news website - tehelka.com, exposed rampant corruption in the Indian government by setting up a sting operation. This paper explores tehelka.com as a critical turning point in Indian journalism. By conducting two-dozen interviews with Indian editors, journalists, news anchors and tehelka.coms reporters, the paper analyzes the factors responsible for the delayed rise of muckraking in India and the impact it has had in reforming the media landscape. The interviews indicate that tehelka.coms efforts forever changed the role of Indian press, asserted its independence, and redefined the modes and codes of journalistic practices."

This study tests the impact of an in-school media/social marketing campaign, in combination with a participatory, community-based media effort, on marijuana, alcohol and tobacco uptake among middle-school students.
Methods. Eight media treatment and eight control communities throughout the U.S. were randomly assigned to condition. Within both media treatment and media control communities, one school received a research-based prevention curriculum and one school did not, resulting in a crossed, split-plot design. Four waves of longitudinal data were collected over two years in each school and were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models to account for clustering effects.
Results. Youth in intervention communities (N = 4216) showed fewer users at final post-test for marijuana (odds-ration [OR] =.49, p<.05), for alcohol (OR=.39, p<.05), and, marginally, for cigarettes (OR=.47, p<.10 [two-tailed]). Latent growth trajectory results varied by substance outcome and by analytic strategy."

The goal here is to explicate the management of understanding uncertainty that is often exhibited in the interaction between nonnative speakers and native speakers. Understanding uncertainty is defined here as a communication incident in which the participant forms an interpretation of the others utterance, but there is an exhibition of uncertainty about what was said and/or what was meant.
The data examined here consist of four dyadic, naturally occurring conversations between NNTA and ACS in office hour. The four NNTA and four ACS participants were recruited from the Department of Economics at a Northeast State University. The office-hour interactions were all audio-taped. Each participant was interviewed separately after the office-hour interaction was recorded. Based on the participants actual discourses and their retrospective accounts, the present study found that ACS participants did experience some understanding uncertainty. The ACSs understanding uncertainty was not related to their inability to understand what the NNTA said as much as their inability to identify what was meant in what the NNTA said. The ACSs understanding uncertainty was displayed and managed in their selective uses of reformulations. These reformulations were classified, based on their function, into six categories: elucidative reformulation, elaborative reformulation, inductive reformulation, deductive reformulation, replicative reformulation, and explicative reformulation. The close analyses of these reformulations revealed that mutual understanding could be enhanced in the NNTA-ACS interactions."

Do the newspaper and TV reporters who serve as the link between environmental scientists and the public on such issues also vary, by region, in the way they cover environment stories? This study, building on an initial examination of New England environment reporters (Science Communication, 23:4), used a census approach to examine environment reporters in the Mountain West, Pacific Northwest and South, in addition to New England. Across all four regions, these reporters were more experienced, on average, but spend much of their time also covering non-environment stories. They relied more often on local sources than on national sources and used a variety of story frames and angles to construct their reporting. In discussing barriers to reporting, they were more likely to cite such issues as time constraints or the size of the news hole, rather than interference by editors or advertisers. Most felt the need to remain objective, rejecting calls for advocacy or a civic journalism approach. The study found more similarities across the regions than differences, suggesting there is a national norm for covering the environment. That may be due to the type of people attracted to field, the uniform training they have received, or newsroom routines. A special case can be made for the Pacific Northwest, where reporters differed from their counterparts in all other regions on some issues."

Abstract
This paper is trying to examine the inner dynamics of the regional media market. Although language and cultural proximity have been seen as the most important
factors for the formation of a regional media market. However, through exploring
the emergence of TV drama co-production within the greater China media market,
the author argues that the formation of a regional media market is a product of historical contingency instead of a natural formation. In terms of the greater China media market,
the author points out that there are at least four factors contributing to the inner dynamics within this regional media market, and they are: 1. the geo-politics; 2. the cultural proximity and linguistic advantage; 3. technological inventions and 4. market force. The paper also contends that the centers and peripheries within a regional media market are fluid instead of fixed positions."

The primary focus was to investigate the link between culture and self-construals. For the individual level culture, three sub-concepts of independent-interdependent self-construals (Triandis, et al., 1988) were employed. A questionnaire containing the self-construal scale and the Relational Closeness Inventory (Berscheid, et al, 1989) was administered to Japanese (82) and U.S. American (157) students. Two hypotheses were tested. Contrary to the predictions, Japanese and U.S. Americans did not differ in ranking their relational partners in terms of the degree of closeness, and U.S. Americans showed significantly closer feelings toward their friends and lovers than Japanese. At the individual level, one hypothesis was only partially supported whereas the other was not. These findings raised a question on the association of culture and self-construals"

In addition the intercultural couples perceived the cultural issues of language, communication, adapting spouses, friends, raising children, female-male roles, visibility, and traditions as relevant in their relationship. The intercultural dialectics of difference-similarity, privilege-disadvantage, and belonging-exclusion were identified in the relationships of these intercultural couples."

Abstract
Two studies used an equity framework to examine the role of relational maintenance communication with relationship satisfaction and loneliness among partners contending with cancer. Participants in study one were undergraduates reporting on a relationship in which one partner had cancer; study two participants were 18 adult pairs (36 individuals, one of whom was a cancer patient). Results indicate that, compared to individuals in relationships not affected by cancer, people in relationships affected by cancer experienced less relational satisfaction, and used fewer relational maintenance strategies. But maintenance mitigated this effect and demonstrated substantial positive correlations with cohesion and satisfaction. Results also indicate statistically significant relationships between loneliness and maintenance strategy use and satisfaction, though the direction of the correlations varied across role of the individual in the relationship. Partners of cancer patients experienced more loneliness as they perceived more maintenance and cohesion in the relationship. Strong support was shown for the value of enacting relational maintenance behaviors to maximize relational satisfaction and benefit regardless of illness status"
2005-1263,Relational Maintenance During Deployment:Communication Between Spouses,Closing the Divide: Interpersonal Communication in Long Distance Relationships,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Relational Maintenance During Deployment:Communication Between Spouses,Closing the Divide: Interpersonal Communication in Long Distance Relationships,"Among the many challenges facing military marriages, one of the most pressing is maintaining healthy relationships during the hardship of separation due to deployment. Spouses are confronted with the demands of coping not only with time and distance apart, but the uncertainty of regular communication opportunities, and the anxiety involved in the dangerous nature of the deployment situation. The present study sought to examine how marital couples maintain their relationships during deployment through communication. The following sections present the conceptualization of relational maintenance and a review of previous studies on maintenance strategies. The content of deployed marital couples communication was analyzed using relational maintenance strategy categories. In accordance with Stafford and Canarys (1991) typology, the strategies of assurances, positivity, and openness were observed. However, moving outside of the typology, the category of small talk emerged as a prevalent part of relational maintenance among the current sample of deployed couples. The findings also indicated the possible mutation of sharing tasks and social networking due to the constraints of the deployment situation. The current study provides a preliminary picture of relationship maintenance patterns for those experiencing this special type of long-distance relationship. Further studies involving larger samples are necessary to validate the findings."

Study 1 (N=145) investigated the use of relational models in three different types of relationships (mother, close friend, & acquaintance). Results showed that even though intimacy and interpersonal power generally predict relational model use, the use of a relational model in one relationship domain correlates only weakly to the use of the same model in a different domain of the same relationship. Study 2 (N = 282) replicated these findings in a cross-cultural context (American & Singaporean) and found evidence suggesting that although relational models are systematically related to horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism, these correlations are only small to medium, particularly when compared to the variance between relational domains. Results of both studies suggest that relational models are a particularly fruitful approach to relationship research when individual relationship domains are considered rather than relationships in general."

It is based on a comparison of two quasi-experimental studies independently conducted on the second televised debate in the 2002 German federal election campaign. Participants in two mid-sized German cities followed the debate on a large-scale screen. The viewers immediate reactions to the candidates were measured in real-time. In terms of technicalities and substance, both quasi-experiments differed in several important respects. For example, the system used in B-Town was based on a control unit with a seven-point scale and yielded one merged metric dimension for both candidates. The A-Town system measured positive and negative impressions of the candidates independently, yielding categorical data. Despite these operational differences, the results show that both methods render reliable results that also meet the criteria of face, construct and criterion validity. Hence, RTR measurements provide valuable, unique insights into subjective immediate reactions to candidates in televised debates and help to explain post-debate perceptions and attitudes."

Comparing Audiovisual and Audio Presentations,Information Systems Interactive Paper Session,"The present study examines the effects of repeated exposure and mode of presentation (audio vs. music video) on the enjoyment of pop music among adolescents, theoretically referring to the concepts of mere exposure and perceptual fluency. In an experiment, participants listened to several pop songs twice (repeated exposure) or watched the music video and subsequently listened to the pop songs (cross-modal exposure) or just listened to the pop songs once (control). Both between- and within-subjects analyses mostly indicate better evaluations for repeated and cross-modal exposure; but only the between-subjects differences reach significance. More than repeated exposure, the mode of presentation influences how a song is liked: The initial video exposure is evaluated more positively than the initial audio exposure and even the second one. Consistent with prior research, no effect of song familiarity on liking is found. The perception of song complexity and preference of pop music in general does not influence liking. The implications for further research and theoretical development are discussed."
2005-1268,Representation of Asians in Hollywood Films: Sociocultural and Industrial Perspectives,The Cultural Gaze and Social/Geographic Hierarchy,Visual Studies,,,Paper,Representation of Asians in Hollywood Films: Sociocultural and Industrial Perspectives,The Cultural Gaze and Social/Geographic Hierarchy,"This paper attempts to identify the factors underlying stereotypical and often negative portrayals of Asians or Asian Americans in Hollywood films from both sociocultural and industrial perspectives. Why has Hollywood maintained its representational practices when it comes to the portrayals of Asians? Why do such portrayals persist in the presence of the growing Asian population and racial diversity in the United States? While sociocultural approaches view negative Asian representations as a reflection of racial prejudice deep-rooted in American culture and society, industrial perspectives regard stereotypical Asian portrayals as consequences of the following factors; underrepresentation of people of color in Hollywood studios, industrial routines and conventions in Hollywood, and the relatively insignificant Asian American market segment. Sociocultural and industrial factors accounting for Hollywoods representational practices, however, are not mutually exclusive. This paper suggests the reciprocity between culture and industry in the construction of racial imagery in Hollywood films."

The following question was central to both studies: to what extent and in what way are ethnic minorities (re)presented in the news? This quantitative analysis adopts a new approach in that the same coding instrument was used in all participating countries. The focus was not only on the news figuring coloured people, but on all domestic news stories. This inclusive approach allowed for the impact of deep-seated news values and other recurrent news-making practices on general news contents to be compared with news stories about ethnic minorities.

Through an inductive coding process, 21 content categories are constructed. Significant associations are found between the sex of the recipient and type of work and balance messages. Data are also deconstructed in terms of memorable absences to reveal the lack discursive frames for altering marital structures, work as community value, and life happiness as key to work success. Finally, these findings are further interrogated to reveal how dominant meanings reflected across these data ideologically position gender, power, and rationality.

Drawing on Foucauldean discourse analysis, I develop a critical perspective on ethnography, grounded in the analysis of discursive operators, the analytic concepts that work to legitimate claims to knowledge in different logics of inquiry. I argue that despite strong assumptions of realism, the ethnographic perspective has been consistently displaced by powerful discursive operators such as Resistance and Reflexivity. I map out the work of these operators across a range of research projects, and I describe a number of contemporary research strategies that help ethnography contend with the determinations of discursive operators."

To examine how seemingly privileged professionals experience and respond to such loss, I examine data drawn from my study of occupational identity among U.S. commercial airline pilots. My analysis indicates a tension faced by many pilots today: how to reconcile the legacy of a potent professional identity with the organizational emasculation of that self. I demonstrate how participants in my study employed discursive tactics to both (a) embrace institutional mandates that airline Captains facilitate crew empowerment and (b) fend off the threat of feminization associated with such mandates. Participant tactics imply that resistance varies in relation to audience, as well as the ironic possibility of resistance through consent. I use the case to suggest that scholars grapple more fully with the empirical and political implications of discursive models of the dialectic of control. Ultimately, I argue that tales of resistance to control lost, however politically contentious, merit serious consideration, for these discursive realities shape lived experience and pose significant obstacles to social change."

The present study attempted to investigate messages designed to convince men to donate their organs and to talk with their families about donation. Standpoint analysis was utilized in the development of messages that were hypothesized to appeal more strongly to men compared to women. Additionally, the life vs. death frame of the messages was manipulated to create some with a focus on life and some with a focus on death as they relate to organ donation. Ten organ donation and four family talk messages were tested on a snowball sample of 3508 respondents (approximately half men and half women) using a paper and pencil measure. The results showed that women responded more positively to all of the messages and that death focused messages generally lead to more positive attitudes toward organ donation. No consistent differences were noted between the male-focused vs. female-focused messages. Additional data collection indicated that the planned male and female foci of the messages were not effectively manipulated. The data indicate the continuing difficulty of targeting organ donation messages to potential male donors, but provide some suggestions for doing so."

Rituals of the sports allow people to construct collective identities by participating in sporting events and to resist dominant ways by their performative acts. Given this theoretical work, I examine the spectacular scenes in the city square during the World Cup in which millions people came together and supported Korean National Football Team. I apply theoretical terms liminal/liminoid, communitas, and carnival to understand the supporting acts, the supporters, and the places of the squares in this spectacular scenes. Finally, I try to theorize a spectacle of the left by understanding sporting events from the perspective of performance studies. The spectacular scenes in the squares could be regarded as energetic and liberating spectacles of the left. In this sense, this paper is a heuristic trial of articulating sports to performance studies and, subsequently, of suggesting an alternative way of understanding sporting events."

Unlike its broadcast counterparts, the cable format allowed the women of SATC to share in frank discussions of their sexuality. While studies have looked at SATC as a postmodern, postfeminist vehicle via the text itself, what are the actual social implications of the series? How do viewers make meaning from the program? More specifically, how do viewers interpret its sexual messages and themes of female friendship, male-female relationships and consumerism? This study utilized various methods, including participant observation, focus groups and in-depth interviews with SATC viewers to examine the impact the series has had on their views of female bonds, sexuality, male-female relationships and American consumerism. Audience analysis found that viewers see City as a multifaceted program that both encourages and hinders women, reflecting a society open to female sexuality but awash in poorly construed male-female relations and false notions of opportunity and class."

When underdeveloped Singapore became independent in 1965, its population policies were strongly anti-natalist. The government feared that unchecked population growth could strain the countrys limited resources (as a small island state with no natural resources) as they would of any underdeveloped country. As a result, population control became one of the primary goals of the city-states socio-economic development. In 1966, the National Family Planning Campaign was launched and the government embarked on a Stop-At-Two (children) policy with the slogan: Girl or Boy  Two is enough.

The populations control campaign was so successful, aided by the economic development of the country and increase in literacy, that the government realized that in a generation, Singapore would not be able to replace its population. That is when, probably for the first time in Asia, a country tried reverse course on population control and exhort people to have more babies! Romancing Singapore was the campaign that Singapores government envisaged to reverse the decrease in population. We study the efficacy of this campaign based on a survey and personal interviews with campaign planners as well as members of the audience. Data reveal that the campaign was not at all successful in persuading singles to marry or married couples to have more babies."

Also, it predicted moderating effects for relationship satisfaction and perceived realism of romantic TV portrayals suggesting that the relation between exposure to romantic TV content and development of stronger parasocial relationship might differ at both level of satisfaction with current romantic relationship and realistic perception of romantic TV portrayals. Participants (196) were recruited from a larger sample (415) of young adults who completed self-administered questionnaires. Results revealed that the romantic TV variables were indeed positive predictors for romantic expectations, satisfaction and strength of parasocial relationship. Additionally, it was found that people holding more romantic expectations also reported more satisfaction in current relationship. Perceived realism was indeed a moderator for the relation between satisfaction and parasocial relationships with mediator characters. However, satisfaction did not interfere in the relation between exposure to romantic TV and parasocial relationships. Implications for these and other findings are discussed."

An analysis of two Israeli newspaper sections and one trade journal providing regularly appearing media reviews and critique suggests the significance and uniqueness of a complementary ritual, conceptualized as paradigm maintenance: the routine construction and reconstruction of journalistic ideology and values. While paradigm maintenance performs some functions parallel to those taken up by paradigm repair, it also provides more substantial opportunities for resistance to the dominant ideology, and tends to present more complex formulations of ethical dilemmas in media practice. As such, it may serve as a more finely tuned seismograph to gradual, leisurely paced shifts in journalistic hegemony."

Ten defense attorneys whove practiced under the two systems discuss their clients experiences of being portrayed on television. The two visual forms are analyzed according to their visual and cognitive messages, and interpreted within a legal defense framework . The defendant portrayals are interpreted as a two different social constructions, one of guilt and the other of process. The interviews with defense attorneys indicate that control is an overriding concern in their role as image-managers. Portrayals of defendants are found to be a news norm that supports authority, contradicting the presentation assumed by news-professionals that the images are objective. More research is indicated for better understanding of defendant impact and juror and potential juror interpretation."

In this study we analyze two such interviews -- one with Yassir Arafat on Israel's Public Channel, the second with Saddam Hussein on CBS -- in an effort to understand how they are seen from the perspective of interviewers, interviewees, government, and audiences. The analysis demonstrates how the interviewers, talking to their own constituency, undertake a negotiator's mode visa v is the interviewees, how the interviewees talks over the heads of the leaders to the people on the enemy side, and how the governments at the receiving end are both threatened by the legitimacy endowed to the enemy, and pleased at his exposure as dangerous or ridiculous."

Diversity on the Micro-Level of News Coverage.",Back in the Newsroom,"The notion of diversity is crucial for our view on mass media as part of a pluralistic society. Media performance in democratic nations is based on this broad principle which often guides the goals of communications policy. At the same time, diversity on its various levels also qualifies as a normative criterion of quality in the field of journalism. Based on a typology of media diversity on different levels of analysis as a framework, our empirical study provides first evidence on the lowest level of TV news diversity  that of daily events and singular film sequences included in coverage of eight main German TV news shows. This micro-level analysis indicates a considerable degree of variety both of shared events and shared footage. We could identify only ten stories that were reported the same by all eight news shows in our seven-day sample, and less than ten percent of daily events were present in more than half of the programs. Among the events with film material that were broadcast by at least two shows, not more than four film sequences could actually be watched in every newscast. On the other hand, more than half of the material was distributed exclusively by one channel. Although focussing increases when we look at the weighted amount of coverage, the variety of TV news coverage is still higher than expected."

As proposed, this study will allow researchers to: 1) compare young adults responses to different types of fear-oriented messages; 2) distinguish those effects from responses to disgust-centered messages; 3) examine the cognitive and emotional responses to health- and social-threat messages. A key feature of this study is that it will focus on the cognitive and emotional responses experiences by young adults while they watch television anti-public service announcements."

Participants were exposed either to a White, light-skinned Black, medium-skinned Black, or dark-skinned Black perpetrator. In addition, participants provided self-reports of their news viewing habits. Results revealed that heavy television news viewers were more likely than light viewers to feel emotional discomfort after being exposed to the dark-skinned Black perpetrator. Heavy news viewers also had favorable perceptions of the victim when the perpetrator was Black, regardless of skin tone. Results also indicated that all participants, regardless of prior news exposure, found the perpetrator more memorable when the perpetrator was a dark-skinned Black male. The methodological and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."
2005-1313,"Science, Technology, and Women Represented in Korean Sci-Fi Girls Comics","Girls Just Wanna Have Fun: Games, Comics and Teen Magazines",Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,"Science, Technology, and Women Represented in Korean Sci-Fi Girls Comics","Girls Just Wanna Have Fun: Games, Comics and Teen Magazines","Inspired by the rebellious nature of both science fiction and girls comics, this paper investigates science, technology, and women represented in Korean sci-fi girls comics. To be more specific, from a feminist perspective, it examines how sci-fi girls comics depict science and technology, how they represent women protagonists, and what such representations mean. Further, it explores the major concerns and themes of sci-fi girls comics and thus illustrates how they challenge the patriarchal binary schemes. Thus, this paper analyzes four texts of Korean girls comics.
As a result, it is found that Korean sci-fi girls comics convey potential supremacy of femininity over masculinity. In other words, science and technology are represented as a futuristic setting to deal with the humanistic themes such as love, life, morality, myth, and religion. Women authors elaborate a strategy to contrast old/nature/human with new/science/technology. Based on such settings, women protagonists, often having the supernatural power, play the significant roles to demonstrate the ascendancy of humanity over technology, and moreover advocate the positive femininity. In the more recent works, we can observe the reconciliation of nature with science, which is claimed by feminist utopian science.
Further, I conclude that such Korean girls comics have the potential of subverting the patriarchal dualism. Although women cartoonists live within patriarchy, they present a more progressive perspective than men. In sum, the underlying idea of feminism exists in Korean sci-fi girls comics, thus giving more publicity to womens own gaze for womens gratification."

Scrapbooks are carefully constructed to demonstrate emotional connection and to ritualize events. However, unlike traditional photo albums filled with ""solemnized"" events (weddings, vacations and holidays), contemporary scrapbooks place more emphasis on ""everyday moments"" and the symbolic meanings of daily life. These narratives of care in turn influence what is seen and remembered, and the construction of identity, family and history."

Literature is critically reviewed from a variety of disciplines and angles, including social science theories and network theories, to support this argument. It is concluded that the WWW has a robust structure of skewed distribution of accessibility which is strengthened by search engines. The latter define the already highly accessible websites as more important and relevant on their search results lists. Moreover, search engines consider links coming from central websites as important to their sites ranking, giving them the power to determine which websites would be accessible via search engines. It is suggested to deal with the inequality of WWW accessibility by reconsidering either the corpus of indexed websites or the searching rationale."

But as authoritative sites, what is presented and what is not can have a major impact on how society sees itself. While theoretically the museum community has faced up to the contested nature of heritage mediation dealing with issues such as ideology, representation of gender, and postcolonial ethnography, embedded bias is revealed upon closer analysis of exhibition practice. This paper illustrates inherent race and gender issues in the planning and design of museum displays by examining the development history of and techniques of mediation used in a current exhibit in Toronto on the Underground Railroad. Drawing on written objectives, planning minutes and scripts for the display, and a semiotic analysis of the visual impact of the exhibit, what planners intended to be seen and what is actually presented are compared. The paper concludes by offering insights that may mitigate the political difficulties of museum mediation, bringing together theory and practice."

Recently, the magazines view of the world has become more complex. Since 1995, the magazine has been producing editions published in languages other than English. This raises questions as to how international audiences negotiate these glocalized representations. By investigating how the National Geographic Age of Samurai (2003) story resonates with Japanese individuals this study addresses the cross-cultural reception of an American text not simply exported to another country but an American text repackaged for a local foreign audience."

This paper conceptualizes the desired Europeanization of the national public spheres as a gradual process that may occur on three different dimensions: 1. segmented Europeanization, 2. discursive Europeanization, and 3. collective identification with Europe. It then presents the results of our empirical research on the transnationalization of public spheres in Europe: What is the prevailing pattern of Europeanization that can be observed in different countries of the EU?
We have conducted a quantitative content analysis of the political discourses in quality newspapers of five EU member states (Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain) over a period of twenty years. According to the analysis of more than 3000 articles the main pattern of transnationalization to be found in all countries is segmented Europeanization: Within each public sphere we find more and more talk about European institutions and policies but there is no indication of an increase in the debate in between the national public spheres. This notwithstanding, we find that the level of discursive interaction transcending national borders has already been considerably high in the beginning of our analysis in 1982. In addition, we find indications of a gradually developing a European we-perspective."

In addition to governmental and civil society organizations, private corporations seek strengthened roles in Internet governance. A number of inter-governmental organizations, as well as in non-government organizations and states are now debating goals and forms of Internet governance.

Internet governance may be approached most usefully by distinguishing among three distinct segments of Internet service provision, and the governance goals, bodies, and mechanisms most appropriate and relevant to each. This allows different problems to be identified, different actors and institutions to be mobilized, and appropriate policy mechanisms to be debated and designed for each. By separating these segments, policy concerns may be addressed more concretely, within a feasible scope, and constructive solutions unique to different sectoral activities identified and implemented."

German participants (n = 276) of two age groups (18-30 vs. 50-65 yrs) browsed through an online news magazine. During the 4 min browsing time, selective news exposure was unobtrusively logged. Eight manipulated articles focused on an individual and varied along three within-factors: Gender and age group (18-30 vs. 50-65 yrs) of the portrayed individual, as well as valence of the news story (positive vs. negative). Effectiveness of these manipulations had been established in a pretest. After browsing news, participants completed a questionnaire including a self-esteem scale.
Results show that users prefer media content on same-gender and same-age group individuals. Furthermore, females with low self-esteem favored upward comparison choices with positive articles, whereas high self-esteem females preferred downward comparisons based on negative articles. This pattern was reversed for males."

Participants will be asked to browse through news reports presented via an experimental online newsmagazine, while selective exposure times for articles are logged via software. Presented news reports feature the same number of articles on social/interpersonal contexts and on achievement/performance contexts, containing the same number of positive and negative reports in each category. A pretest established unambiguous classification of these articles in the context domains and as positive or negative reports. Furthermore, the presented articles focus on individuals, while having the gender of the individuals balanced across context and valence of the articles.
After a scheduled browsing time, participants will be asked to indicate impressions of the newsmagazine (to provide closure) and to complete a questionnaire on demographics and self-esteem."

It employed a 2 (low vs. high independent self-construal) X 2 (low vs. high interdependent self-construal) X 2 (physical vs. social threat) X 2 (within-subject pretest vs. posttest) mixed repeated-measures design. Of the 911 college students who participated in the pretest, a total of 700 students completed the experiment and posttest. The results showed that main effects for both independent and interdependent self-construals were found. Participants high in independent self-construal reported greater scores for perceived severity, perceived response efficacy, perceived self-efficacy, intention to use condoms, condom interpersonal impact, knowledge about gonorrhea, and perceived content learning, but lower scores for message reactance and defensive avoidance than those low in independent self-construal. Participants high in interdependent self-construal reported higher scores for perceived severity and condom interpersonal impact, but lower scores for message reactance and defensive avoidance. Two-way interaction effect between independent and interdependent self-construals was also found. Using Yamada and Singelis (1999) typologies of self-construal, the cultually-alienated participants had the highest perceived susceptibility scores followed by the bicultural, Western and traditional participants. The bicultural participants also had the highest scores for perceived severity, while the culturally-alienated participants had the lowest scores. The Western and traditional participants had similar scores for perceived severity."

While the general connection between self-disclosure and intimacy has been clearly established in friendship literature, little to no effort has been made to establish the relationship between self-disclosure and intimacy among pre-existing same-sex heterosexual male friendships. The current study examines this link in established friendships, using multiple measures of self-disclosure (amount of self disclosure, breadth of self-disclosure, and lack of depth-control of self-disclosure) and multiple conceptualizations of intimacy (closeness of friends, strength of influence among friends, diversity of activity between friends, perceived bonding of friends, and time friends spend together weekly). Results are discussed as potential predictors of perceived friendship behaviors, such that self-disclosure among men is significantly related to the experience of, and behaviors within, the friendship as a whole. Essentially, men who reported engaging in more self-disclosure with their same-sex friends perceived that relationship as closer on multiple dimensions."

This research study attempts to examine self-disclosure behaviors in LDFs through both face-to-face (FtF) interactions and computer-mediated communication (CMC) channels and understand social impact of new information technologies on relational communication between long-distance friends.
Specifically, relationships between self-disclosure and geographic distance, relationship stage, gender, cultural values, and friendship quality are tested in both FtF and CMC contexts. Research subjects were recruited from a large public southwestern university. A total of 388 students from 43 countries and regions participated in the study through a web survey.
Results of the study suggest that in LDFs people tend to disclose slightly greater in FtF settings than in CMC environment and women are likely to reveal personal or private information to others slightly more than men do. And overall, self-disclosure in both FtF and CMC contexts is highly associated with relationship quality. However, geographic distance does not influence self-disclosure behaviors between long-distance friends in either FtF or CMC context. Once people are separate, it does not matter how far apart they are from each other. Moreover, self-disclosure trumps culture in the present study, indicating that the intimate nature of friendship may be trans-cultural."

However little insight has been provided to explain how people form and change their self-efficacy. Review of literature on self-efficacy conceptualization suggests that the judgment of personal ability in a given context for a given behavior is the theoretical core of the self-efficacy notion. Components of self-efficacy include appropriateness of behavioral goals, behavior- and context-specific skills, necessary resources and opportunity to perform the act, as well as elimination of barriers. Empirical findings have confirmed all the above factors as determinants of self-efficacy. Different ways to influence these components are also illustrated. Direction for future research is discussed."

This study undertakes an exploration of what happens during our initial interaction with a television program.

Using an episode of a situation comedy that participants had not seen before, we examined development of their choice of a favorite character and their attribution of personality characteristics to that favorite. Evidence suggests that ones own perceived personality and the sense of being part of a mediated world are important factors in choice of a favorite character."

A self-report measure of prevention focus confirms that an online versus conventional shopping environment induces the consumers prevention focus. Furthermore, results show that this consumer prevention focus carries over to behavior in a domain unrelated to online shopping, particularly for consumers who are not chronically prevention focused and have prior experience with online purchasing. The results provide a basis for further understanding of online consumer behavior. Implications for future research are discussed."

Rice has been the main diet of Koreans for thousands of years, yet Hetbahn was the first product of pre-cooked rice. Traditionally rice cooking has been considered as the housewifes exclusive responsibility. Despite its convenience, Koreans hesitated to purchase instant rice products. The Hetbahn ads were designed to reduce the psychological barriers of Korean consumers. Through examining the narratives and images of Hetbahn ads, this study found that Hetbahn ads employed the myth of the traditional mother. Furthermore, Hetbahn ads exploited the notion of mother nostalgia by creating a never fulfilled yearning towards the mother. Finally, Hetbahn ads bring in technology as a savior that claims superiority over real life mothers, insinuating that the only substitute of mothers rice, and thus mothers love, is the product, Hetbahn."

This paper is inspired by the question. The debates on new women I will explore in this paper reside in public narratives on the nature of new women in the Korean womens magazine Shingajong (New Family) from January 1933-August 1934. Many articles in the popular magazine of the 1930s attempted to adopt a reformist discourse on educated new women but simultaneously condemning new womens adoption of western ideas of sexual liberation and gender equality. While the modernizing male nationalists acknowledged the need for womens education and their involvement in the movement, they resisted a radical restructuring of gender relations, especially when what women wanted and acquired from the nationalist movement was not confined to the cause of nationalism.
The terms of new womens arguments centered on issues of sexual liberation and the adoption of western fashion styles. I argue that new womens configuration of womens liberation and power structure within Korean society led them to individualistic modes of negotiating their identity and claiming agency. Much of the public censure and the symbolic social death of new women came from societys male-centered critique that marginalized the ways that new women actively negotiated and resisted the social and familial constraints upon them."

Of the 911 college students who participated in the prescreening phase of the study, a total of 700 students completed the experiment. The results showed that the collectivistic participants had greater increase in posttest scores for perceived severity, perceived response efficacy, perceived self-efficacy, and knowledge about gonorrhea than individualistic participants. LSS expressed greater condom self-control than HSS. Participants exposed to the physical appeal message seemed to be able to recall the information better than participants exposed to the social appeal message. Participants from individualistic societies expressed greater perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived response efficacy, perceived self-efficacy, condom interpersonal impact and condom self-control than participants from collectivistic societies. In addition, participants from individualistic societies seemed to be able to recall the information better than participants from collectivistic societies."

The present study brings in the voices of people notably absent from most discussion of the implications of gay characters on TV: gay people themselves. Guided by the communication theory of identity and its tenet that identity is multidimensional, the study draws from responses generated in interviews with 22 gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals regarding their opinions of representations of gay characters on TV. The study focuses primarily on the relational dimension of identity, with observations and opinions from interviewees about the relationships gay characters on TV have - their romantic same-sex relationships as well as their relationships with heterosexual people. The analysis finds that participants note that gay characters are often primarily identified by their sexuality, but at the same time are generally not allowed visible or continuing romantic relationships on mainstream TV. Respondents offer mixed views about the relationships gay characters have with straight characters on TV; some find the relationships limited by a homosexual/heterosexual divide, while others find gay/straight relationships to be strong and well-adjusted. The analysis concludes that while gay people are often ambivalent about gay relationships as depicted on fictional TV programs, they ultimately see great potential for TV to educate both gay and straight people about the complexity - and normalcy - of gay relationships, and gay identity in general."

Lang, 2000). LC3MP explains mediated message processing from an information-processing perspective. In this study, secondary analysis of an existing experimental data set will be performed to test hypothesis using the newly developed I-squared coding scheme. In the original experiment participants viewed 30 PSAs which varied on production pacing. Production pacing was operationalized as number of cuts plus ½ the number of edits. Predictions involving production pacing, based on previous studies, were not consistently supported. One possible explanation given for this somewhat surprising finding was that PSAs are processed differently from other types of television. A second possibility, and the one being tested here, was that the effect of production pacing on message processing is mediated by the amount of information introduced."

This paper will report a study currently underway which further examines the interactive effects of camera changes per second and I-squared per second on STRTs for messages which vary in terms of arousing content and emotional valence. One goal of this study is to determine if variation in STRTs in response to resource allocation is the same or different as a function of motivational (approach or avoid) set."

Based on previous work in cultural, gender, and leisure studies, as well as research on computer mediated communication (CMC), this study researches an online fandom gossip community and the various ways posters use gossip. It inductively builds from community gossiping practices to interactional roles and collaborative actions. The results suggest that the community uses gossip to build norms and beliefs, relying heavily on humor as a way to decrease the likelihood of conflict when expressing beliefs on inflammatory subjects. Identifiability also played a role in the interaction between posters. The public nature of the group suggests that there is a need for a new understanding of gossip. It also suggests a need for further research on fan gossip, as it relates to a number of separate fields and fuels conflicts within multiple subsections of fandom."

Yet, the process has been slow and largely unfulfilling for both the courts and the television networks. Developments in this field, compared to other countries, notably the United States, Canada and New Zealand, have progressed only on an ad hoc basis. A preliminary study indicates that the management in television newsrooms, notably news directors, have not been proactive in gaining camera access in any systematic or unified way. Indeed, the courts have argued: we got the table set but nobody came to dinner. In contrast, the other countries mentioned above have all either introduced televised court proceedings on a reasonably regular basis, have undergone formal trial periods of allowing cameras in courts, or both. It is the proposition of this paper that the Australian scenario should be considered within the context of the free speech debate and the absence of a constitutional Bill or Charter of Rights, which guarantees a free media. This lack of a constitutional guarantee of free speech sets Australia at odds with these other three democratic countries."

Using data collected in May-June 2004, the analysis shows that many who say they would not vote for a woman for president would do so if given realistic political scenarios with head-to-head match ups with potential candidates. Results indicate that survey respondents were about as likely to vote for Hillary Clinton as John Kerry in a match up against George W. Bush, and many who say they are unlikely to vote for a woman do so when forced to choose between a woman of their own party and a man of the opposing party."

In this manuscript we discuss the similarities and differences of more and less powerful communication in female and male communication and highlight the similarities between power and sex. Comparison suggests that several characteristic male and female differences in communication behaviors may actually be differences in occupying positions or roles with more or less power. Implications of power and sex differences for leadership, professional relationships, and social relationships are discussed as well as the complexities of these relationships when sex, power, and communication are considered"

This report contributes to that body of work by describing female participants reactions to 11 sexually oriented commercials, and examining the relationship between sexual self-schema and ad responses. Preliminary findings suggest that females with positive sexual self-schemas reported more favorable affect, attitude-toward-the-ad, and purchase intention than females with negative sexual self-schemas."

It helps deconstruct our identity. In Chocolat (1988), Claire Denis argues that cinema makes a great intervention in capturing characters secrets and inner lives and transcribing their desire for the audience. She uses film technology to recreate important moments and events of her childhood in Cameroon. She turns her camera to investigate her family history and the patriarchal colonial ideology that sustained it, structured the behavior and feelings of its members and marked their personality for life. She also challenges the simplistic idea that colonial power only enforced its hegemony through force. She demonstrates how the search for sexual love and intimacy is a powerful driving force that can either oppress the individual or free him .
Through her memory, Denis debate taboos, sexual desire and power relation as mediated through technology to argue that these emotions can be traced at the level of the visual, through movements and gestures. She provides a visual field of racialized gaze to complicate the participants longing, desire and sex with their notions of self-worth and integrity. The movie is a visual metaphor to discuss colonization, taboos, desire and racism, the place of women and their desire in patriarchal society, individual agency and the role of children in a society that considers them invisible. The movie moves forward from memories of colonization to meditate on its legacy by inferring the taboos that still between France and Cameroon to this day."

Following along with the textbooks, I gave the biological conceptualization of sex brief mention and quickly moved on to gender, the social and cultural constructions. Yet, I wanted to know more about the complexities of sex. How do we actually define sex? Why have we split sex from gender? In what ways are we better off from splitting the two concepts? In what ways have we suffered? Can we participate in the sex dialogue without oppressing women? Can we find ways to include communication scholars in the important dialogue of integrating sex and gende? With the introduction of biological and evolutionary perspectives of communication into our curriculum, I believe these are important questions to ask. I believe this pursuit of understanding the sex/gender divide will lead us toward the development of a progressive, integrative sex/gender communication theory and place communication scholars into a dialogue already in progress in multiple disciplines. In this paper, I explore the complexities of sex."

Results show that when considering a stigmatized health risk such as HIV/AIDS, optimistic bias for personal susceptibility is reduced. In addition, perceptions of self-severity for the negative outcome of the risk is also reduced. The effect of courtesy stigma and inaccurate predictions of future affective state are offered as possible reasons to explain these results."

This content analysis evaluated media coverage before and after Congress passed the resolution that authorized the use of military force in Iraq. A sharp decline in critical coverage was observed after Congress passed this resolution. However, the press continued to report substantial levels of opposition originating with foreign governments and the United Nations, despite the decline in oppositional coverage originating from domestic government sources. This studys results suggest a more nuanced relationship between the news media and government than frequently reported."
2005-1354,Short-Circuited: Communication and Working Class Struggle in China,Communication and Media Studies in Asia,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Short-Circuited: Communication and Working Class Struggle in China,Communication and Media Studies in Asia,"This paper examines the communicative dimensions of growing unrest amongst industrial workers in contemporary China. These struggles potentially have global significance, but have received little attention from theorists and activists within movements against capitalist globalization. Examinations of recent worker unrest suggest that the fragmented and uncoordinated nature of labour activism in China is partly reflective of the Chinese states success in controlling information flows and blocking workers access to autonomous channels of communication. Coverage of worker unrest is often excluded from Chinas mainstream media through censorship, or is articulated within hegemonic neoliberal discourses. Nascent autonomous labour communication networks, media and organizational structures have been harshly repressed. These communication blockages have helped pre-empt the development of a collective identity that might recompose Chinas stratified working people as a political subject. The difficult situation of Chinese workers problematises theories that fetishize decentralization and spontaneity as strengths in emancipatory social and political movements."

The study used messages targeted toward high sensation-seeking impulsive decision-makers (HSSIDMs), and utilized an interrupted time series design with a control community. N=100 individuals were surveyed randomly in each city each month (for a period of 21 months) regarding their safer sexual beliefs and behaviors. In Lexington, a three-month televised campaign took place, while no such campaign took place in Knoxville. Time series regression analyses indicated that condom use, as well as condom use self-efficacy and intentions increased significantly (p<.05) among HSSIDMs in Lexington. Increases in condom use were of reasonable magnitude as well, with an effect size of d=.26. No such changes took place in Knoxville. The results suggest that a mass media campaign using only televised PSAs can change safer sexual behaviors as well as attitudes and beliefs. The implications of these results are discussed."

Need Fulfillment, Well-Being, and Social Network Structure",Need Fulfillment in Interpersonal Relationships,"While the belief that individual well-being is affected substantially by experiences of personal need fulfillment is an implicit component of many frameworks, the process of fulfillment through interaction and as a partial consequence of social network structure has received comparatively less attention. This study examined both the link between need fulfillment and well-being at a general level, and the role of network structure in the determination of both fulfillment and well-being. Analyses involved comparisons of 91 participants involved in exclusive romantic relationships and 105 single individuals. Results indicated significant associations among need fulfillment, well-being and network structure. Specifically, individuals in exclusive relationships experienced greater well-being, greater affection fulfillment, and lower emotional loneliness than single individuals. Significant differences were not found for inclusion and control needs. The results illustrate the importance of specific network features to overall well-being, further analyses revealed complex associations among the variables that should be addressed in future research."

This paper looks at two moments in the development of these fags-and-hags stories in popular film and television, from art-house obscurity in films like My Hustler in the 1960s to the mainstream popularity of My Best Friends Wedding in the 1990s.

As writers such at Steve Maddison have argued, certain fags-and-hags narratives offer possibilities for producing and foregrounding anti-patriarchal political alliances between gay men and straight women. Unfortunately, our popular culture thus far has been much more likely to produce sidekick stories or tales of sexual competition than stories of gender dissent and political affiliation. Moreover, the fact that these stories are based on a dramatically limited notion of femininity and gay male gender identity prevents them from being as transformative as they might be."

Despite increasingly sophisticated understandings of the effects of integrating CTs into work and private lives, we still know relatively little about how people learn to use the affordances and constraints of CTs to perform social actions in situ and in vivo. Using consumer-level personal IP videoconferencing as our example CT, this ethnomethodological paper explores one piece of pilot-study data that illustrates aspects of a concept-in-progress: situated exploratory learning about how to use CTs. Videoconferencing has been chosen because, like email and Instant Messaging before it, videoconferencing is currently moving from being cutting-edge to mainstream as its quality increases and its costs decrease. It is increasingly becoming a rich medium for anything from professional collaboration to relational maintenance."

Only the perception is measured whether important others would approve or disapprove it if a person performs a certain behavior. However, more types of social influence can be discerned and it is hypothesized that the conceptualization of the social factor should be broadened. This study brings together the fragmentary knowledge on social influence factors related to smoking cessation. An inventory of social influence variables shows six social influence factors. With the exception of descriptive norm, most of these are rarely studied in the context of smoking cessation. Regression analyses on the data of 1,107 smokers is used to estimate the relative importance of social influence variables as predictors of intention and smoking cessation behavior. The regression analysis show that the subjective norm is not the most important social influence variable. It has more effect if other people tell a smoker to quit. The effect of the injunctive norm, that is the perceived acceptability of smoking in society, is similar to the effect of the subjective norm. Results suggest that health campaigns should incite social interaction between smokers and non-smokers. Also, studies into smoking cessation should take account of the various social influence factors that are outlined in this study."

We examine to what extent inter-cultural as well as other relevant socio-psychological factors influence online information seeking and sharing behavior. To examine this research issue, we created a field experimental research setting where 288 students from two different cultures (one university in the U.S. and two in Singapore) socially recommended some useful information using online forum for one semester. We examine how group membership, interpersonal social networks, and intercultural differences influence the ways in which distributed CMC users exchange, utilize, and evaluate socially recommended information."

This paper analyzes patterns of sourcing and framing in newspaper coverage of two social protests set decades apart -- the Vietnam anti-war protests in October 1967 and the anti-WTO protests in November-December 1999. The results reveal journalists increasing reliance on official and authoritative sources. No such change is seen in the number of sources cited from the protesters side. No change is seen in either the use of the episodic versus the thematic frames or in story valence. In particular, these patterns of reportage are unaffected by the use of the Internet by journalists for their research and sourcing, indicating that journalists may still be on the fringes of Internet-mounted political communication."

For example, in Namibia, parents dying from AIDS-related illness have left their orphaned children in need adoption. Some diseases and health conditions may have social acceptability, whereas others may carry a stigma. We extend the extended parallel process model (EPPM, Witte, 1992) to include issues of stigma and collective efficacy. We found that Namibian participants (n = 400) process personal efficacy and stigma when evaluating personal willingness to support those with HIV, where as collective efficacy and group stigma predicted beliefs about adopting AIDS orphans. Contrary to prediction from EPPM, these effects appeared for those who did not assess HIV as a health threat. Practical applications and intervention designs are discussed."

Given that Internet-related social support may become more pertinent as the Internet penetrates newer sectors of the American population, this paper draws on broader sociological and Internet literature relating to social capital and social shaping of technology to discuss Internet related social resources, a form of social capital that is assessed via families of Internet users. The study empirically examines the association between social resources, family support and Internet connection behaviors by using surveys (n= 739) and focus group interviews (n=26) collected from residents in two newer Hispanic immigrant communities. Results show that kinships networks and social resources in the home are significant predictors of individuals Internet adoption and Internet use. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results as well as implications for policy and future research on the digital divide."

This article recognizes technology as a socio-cultural product which has historically been constituted by certain forms of knowledge and social practice, so it explores the socio-historical contexts that gave rise to the Korean texts. In particular, it emphasizes the way in which the 1997 economic crisis as one of the most significant socio-cultural turning points in modern Korean history has influenced the deployment of broadband services because high-speed Internet connections have developed since 1997. It first briefly discusses important government policies for the rapid deployment of broadband services in order to provide the reader with background information on the infrastructure and institutional implications in Korea. It then examines several social factors¾such as PC bang (Internet cafes), online trading, and housing patterns¾to ascertain how they have contributed to the rapid growth of broadband. This article finally articulates cultural elements contributing to the diffusion of broadband services in the context of the cultural environment in Korea."

Using critical political economy, textual analysis, and ethnographic methods to radically contextualize the series production and distribution, the essay reveals that the emergence of the series and program-length advertisements relied on a constellation of changes in regulatory arenas and economic financing for both pornography and television industries. With a media terrain that changed dramatically over the course of the 1970s and 1980s, Joe Francis, the series creator brought together groups of media workers, specifically video producers and cable representatives, who stood to gain from mutual investments in the companys product in the 1990s. This market coup places Girls Gone Wild in the middle of a new televisual economy, one that represents a heterosexualized, white girl next door in order to deliver the male that Francis now embodies."

We hypothesized that women would evaluate an insensitive female helper and her behavior more negatively than they would a male helper. In Experiment 1, participants (N = 137) read conversations in which male or female helpers sought to comfort emotionally distressed friends. In Experiment 2, participants (N = 87) engaged in face-to-face interactions in which they were comforted by either a male or female helper who used insensitive comforting messages. Overall, the results imply that women with deficient emotional support skills may be at high risk of rejection by same-sex peers."

A model was tested with 107 undergraduate avatar non-users. Results indicated that the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) explained intention to use avatar-relate products, and the link between Internet self-efficacy as an external variable and TAM was also supported. More specifically, all relationships among variables in the TAM, such as perceived ease of use of avatar, perceived usefulness of avatar, attitude toward using avatar, and intention to use avatar-related products, were strongly supported, as was the link between Internet self-efficacy and perceived ease of use of avatar. Also, the subjective norm component in the TRA successfully predicted the influence of attitude toward using avatars and intention to use avatar-related products. Overall, all hypotheses were supported and the data were judged to be consistent with the model."

Located on the border of China, between the worlds largest continent and largest ocean, Taiwan has flourished economically as one of the Four Tigers economies. As one of most modernized and democratized countries in Asia, Taiwan has witnessed the rise of modern (homo)-sexuality in the 90s, which continues to attract public attention. Winning multiple awards in the international art film circuit, Malaysian-born auteur director Tsai Ming-liang has been known for his innovative representation of modern (homo)-sexuality in the Taiwanese society. Tsais films portray a variety of ways in which people perceive and consume time, space, and sexuality as a means of forming identity and connecting between here and there, between now and then. The processes of globalization and local identity formation are much more complicated, ambiguous, and multifaceted than the one-way cultural homogenization thesis would assume. Drawing upon Hall's and Appadurais discourses, I will analyze three of Tsais films, The River and Good-bye Gragon Inn to illustrate his unique cinematic aesthetics and identity politics in representing time, space, and modern sexuality at the crossroad of modernization and globalization."

This paper maps out a complementary way of thinking about the digital and the question of division  between individual women and between women of different classes. The division in question here is a spatial division which is structured by the use of information technologies in the domestic sphere, and which has troubling implications for collaborative, collective approaches to social and economic issues facing all women. The manner in which domestic information technologies are currently designed and marketed to be deployed by women can be usefully submitted to the critique of the material feminists of the 19th and early 20th century, who so clearly understood the barriers to womens true equality that the private, technologically independent household embodies. The material feminist critique speaks directly to our own historical moment by foregrounding the interconnections between spatial relations, the distribution and use of domestic technologies, and womens struggles for economic and social justice."

Specifically, the study investigates the extent to which time estimation can be used as a valid measurement of presence. There has been an argument over the relationship between presence and time estimation among researchers, although many researchers have agreed that there is a negative relationship between presence and time estimation (e.g. the more people experience presence, the more time speeds up). Kurita (2003) examined theoretical differences which had led the researchers to the opposite prediction and conducted an experiment in the prospective paradigm. The results showed the negative relationship between spatial presence (e.g. being there) existed only when the stimuli were short, which partially supported the general prediction. However, another possible relationship between presence and time estimation could be analyzed through the absolute value approach which examines how much people lost track of time regardless of the direction of the time variance (e.g. over- or under-estimation). It will be argued in this paper which analytical approach has more explanatory power and theoretical validity."
2005-1371,Speaking of Discipline: A Framework for Analyzing the Discourse of State Surveillance,Watching and Being Watched,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Speaking of Discipline: A Framework for Analyzing the Discourse of State Surveillance,Watching and Being Watched,"This paper offers a comparative examination studies focusing on state discourses that attempt to justify the surveillance of citizens. The critical review reveals that state discourses can be classified according to subject and function categories. This heuristic classification uncovers four patterns of surveillance discourse. Within each pattern, a desire for discipline serves as the underlying purpose or nature of the surveillance activities. In this manner, the various cases compared here provide support for Foucaults theoretical assertion that surveillance serves a disciplinary function in society. The papers focus and conclusion is in keeping with the conference theme of dialogue in that it provides insight into a governments dialogue with its citizens."

This transformation has fuel not only military engagements in Afghanistan against Al-Qaeda and Iraq against Saddam Hussein, but they also catapulted notions that prophesized a civilizational and religious confrontation to the forefront of political debate. Samuel Huntingtons (1996) frequently quoted thesis on the clash of civilizations became a popular interpretation of what he considered immutable differences between the Islamic and Judeo-Christian traditions and the inevitability of a contestation between them. The paper offers an institutional assessment of Radio Sawa, its mission, motivations, and the role of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). It provides a discussion of Radio Sawa as an approach to public diplomacy along with a description of how the station has evolved and responses to its programming from Western and Arab press. A review of how public diplomacy has been conceptualized, its theoretical underpinnings and application with particular emphasis on the role of mass media is also presented. Based on a preliminary discourse analysis of the stations news and entertainment content mediated representations of the other, the cultural impact of civilizational and cultural interaction, cultural hybridity, glocalization, transnationalism and identity mediation are interrogated. Finally, a model of discursive and ideological construction of the news is offered as a description of the stations journalistic practice."

This paper argues that, along with that of Karl Marx, the spirits of Harold Adams Innis and Herbert Marshall McLuhan haunt us on a regular basis in media and cultural studies. If they already exist in ghostly form, perhaps by exorcising them through the logic of the specter, we can allow them to co-mingle with the living via historical materialism, Marxism, and phenomenology."

While scholars have examined fans for sports, soap operas, and reality programs separately, they havent looked for commonalities in fanship across programming genres. This study assessed the ways in which the viewing experience for sports fans is similar toand different fromthe viewing experience for fans of other popular genres of programming. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by 267 students at a large Midwestern university. Close-ended questions assessed the viewing experience for soap operas, reality programs, situation comedies, daytime and late night talk shows, adult-oriented animation programs, and prime time dramas. Fans of televised sports were likely to engage in a variety of pre-game planning and information search activities. Their viewing was more likely to be purposive and content-oriented. Sports fans appeared to be active viewers who took a keen interest in the action on the screen. They were emotionally involved and cared about the outcomes. Perhaps as a result, they also were more likely to check media sources for follow-up information about the games they watched. Sports fans stood alone. Fans for other programming genres were not as active or invested in their favorite programming genre."

The study found that stages of a crisis was an important factor in determining coverage frames and media functions. Media served primarily as a source of information about the crisis in the early stages rather than guidance and consolation in the crisis. The magnitude of the crisis and the uncertainty during the early stages of a crisis limited media in using government officials as sources and the influence of government officials was found to be not as strong as they were expected in a crisis situation involving national interest. Human interest as a story frame was not found to be dominant during this early stage of coverage, and rose as a major frame during the later stages of the coverage."

Two meanings are provided in the dictionary. The first is indeed adverbial and is found already in biblical Hebrew: honestly, in trustworthiness, wholeheartedly. The second comes from a later period of the language (Talmudic period and the Dead-Sea scrolls): but, it is true that, in contrast to what was said before (Even Shoshan 1986). In both usages, some degree of stance the speaker is taking towards his or her talk can be discerned. Even Shoshan classifies be'emet as an adverb, regardless of which of the two meanings are concerned. However, a brief look at the second meaning reveals that it is more of a discourse marker than an adverb.

In this paper, we investigate the various uses of be'emet in casual Israeli Hebrew conversation, not all of which are covered by Even Shoshans definitions. Our goal is to understand the functional itinerary this particular word has followed in Hebrew, through a close exploration of its synchronic uses in the contemporary spoken language. Since this particular adverb, derived from the noun 'emet (truth), is so profoundly tied in with the speakers beliefs and attitudes towards his or her discourse, our journey takes us to consider issues of metalanguage, stance, and modality."

Fan-produced video represents an opportunity for ordinary people to take the means of cultural production into their own hands. However, becauseof its roots in an already-existing, culture industry-produced world, there may exist limits to the amount of resistance this form of vernacular culture can provide. To explore these tensions, Icompare two fan film productions based on the popular Star Trek television and movie franchise. These two productions, both of which are distributed through the Internet, illustrate the differentlevels of attachment to and freedom from the main text that characterize much of fan film."

Explaining news managers' attitudes about newspaper-TV partnerships,"Profit, Convergence, Ownership: Corporate Issues in News Production","This study adopts theory from the study of media production and from the sociology of organizations to explain news managers attitudes about industry trends  in this case, partnerships between TV news operations and newspapers. The study asked, to what degree do managers attitudes toward partnering reflect goal-oriented, rational assessments, and to what degree do they reflect cognitive shortcuts and routine decision-making? The relative impact of news quality vs. financial conditions on manager attitude was also explored. Findings from a survey of U.S. news organizations (N=502) supported the idea that managers bypass rational assessment. The more deeply involved the managers organization is in a partnership, the more favorable the managers attitude toward the general notion of partnering  this is the case no matter how beneficial managers believe their particular partnerships have been. Also, managers attitudes are more influenced by the organizations financial health than by news quality."

But viewer evaluations from previous research suggest news viewers do not prefer tabloid style TV news, based on responses to questions such as how enjoyable, believable, and informative the stories were. However, the data were self-reported and thus there may have been a normative bias in the responses. Further, those studies were conducted with older viewers, so the results may not generalize to the younger viewers so highly sought after by news executives, as studies have found some differences in the way older and younger viewers process and remember television news messages.
This study investigates the effects of sensational television news story content and tabloid style presentation features on attention, arousal, recognition memory, self-report evaluations and channel changing behavior for young adult viewers. The study also examines processing, memory, and behavioral differences based on the sensation seeking personality variable, differences in motivational types, and gender."

The authors maintain that stealth democracy beliefs are due to rather understandable apathy rationales and that a more deliberative democracy is simply of no interest and no benefit to the public. This paper examines survey and related data from a representative sample of 568 Pittsburgh residents, who participated in a deliberation. It finds that stealth democracy beliefs are explained by a number of apathy rationales that are not innocuous but are related to a syndrome of factors including authoritarian beliefs and an incapacity to take the perspective of others. These factors may, in turn, be related to inadequate cognitive development. It also finds that democratic deliberation significantly ameliorates the apathy rationales, potentially remedying stealth democracy beliefs."

The study interviewed 28 adults in-depth, examining their life history with media and technology. Conceptually, the study builds on Bourdieu's ideas of cultural, social and symbolic capital as well as elaborating a concept of linguistic capital, particularly focued on recent migrants. The study examines the way that Latinos and other working class people have to negotiate fields of competition in language, education, technology and work. It also uses the generational perspectives of Daniel Bertaux, looking at how generations of families work toward social mobility using their capital and struggling to compete in fields that they are not always very familiar with.
The study finds that several distinct groups use technology quite differently, based on their levels of formal education and their language skills, more than other aspects of their human capital. Also very important was how recently people had migrated to the U.S., whether recent or longer term, first, second or third generation migrant."

A Study of Political Communication Practices in Swedish Election Campaigns.,Political Communication Around the World: Developing Models and Assessing Realities,Political Communication,,,Paper,Still the Middle Way. A Study of Political Communication Practices in Swedish Election Campaigns.,Political Communication Around the World: Developing Models and Assessing Realities,"This paper focuses on the process of hybridization of political campaigns, using Sweden as a case study, and raises three main research questions. Firstly, how do global campaign practices influence the national campaign context in Sweden? Secondly, how does Swedish political structure and political culture influence the adaptation of global trends in this area? Thirdly, how can a possible hybridization of political campaigning be characterized in Sweden?
The data in this study is mainly based on structured interviews with Party Secretaries and Campaign Officials in all seven parties with seats in the Swedish Parliament.
The results of the study indicate that the hybridization of political communication practices in Sweden is characterized by a growing use of global campaign practices. Marketing tools are frequently used for opinion analyses, but there are substantial obstacles for a complete implementation of modern practices. To some extent this can be explained by existing laws and regulations, but above all, by public perceptions of parties, politics and elections. Sweden is a country with a structural framework where global campaign features can be transformed to a large extent. However, a political culture more influenced by a national campaign context somewhat curtails this transformation process."

In this paper, we argue that focus groups provide a learning context for the empowerment of dialogue participants through the development of communicative self-efficacy as they struggle over constructing and sharing understandings of controversial issues such as human biotechnology. As part of a larger research project on dialogues about science, we present a case study that puts qualitatively collected transcripts of interaction and quantitative self report measures into empirical conversation. In the case study, focus group participation and interaction led to increased participant confidence and motivation towards participating in public dialogues as well as the construction, modification and contestation of attitudes towards science, scientists, and biotechnology. It also suggests that scholars rethink their rationales for and engagement of the focus group as just a method of data collection and reconsider and explore alternative ways of presenting focus group results."

A central claim of public relations is its strategic role in understanding the environment and advising management on adjustment and adaptation initiatives to achieve best fit between organization and environment. The resulting legitimacy or social acceptance of the organization therefore is a critical outcome for the public relations function and relies on careful understanding of both social expectations and appropriate strategies to achieve acceptance. This paper explores public relations conceptualisation of this function and explains why public relations scholars should reconsider the use of the mass media in a strategic function. The limitations of resource dependency theories that underpin adjustment and adaptation approaches can be addressed through concepts in ecological and institutional theory about environmental pressures on organizational structure, strategy and practices. Within this perspective the mass media are an environmental actor that confers legitimacy. Mass media are also active in depicting opinions of those social actors who have the power and ability to influence organizations. I argue that opinions about legitimacy depicted in mass media are a source of intelligence that can drive strategic organizational action."

This is particularly true for people who have multiple and/or contrasting identity claims. Group interviews with 72 allophone and anglophone Montreal residents were used to find patterns in strategies for negotiating these claims, given that these populations must contend with competing discourses about nation, language, ethnicity/ race, religion, etc. A number of strategies were located and discussed, including modification of memory and performativity, strategic blindness, constitutive contradiction, constitutive contrast, and identification through exclusion. Individuals facing greater degrees of contradiction required increasing levels of cognitive labour and more sophisticated strategies of negotiation to make sense of their cultural identities; failure to do so was marked by feeling of isolation and alienation. Most remarkable was the sophistication and creativity with which these people managed complex identity positions."

The current study examines whether emotional support received through interaction with others was effective at moderating the association between terrorism-related stress and psychological health (depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms) for individuals who were not direct victims of the attacks. 511 college students from an East Coast university completed measures of terrorism-related stress, received emotional support, and psychological health in the first two weeks of December, 2001. The results indicate that received emotional support moderated the relationship between terrorism-related stress and depression and somatic symptoms; the relationships between stress and psychological health were weaker for individuals with greater quantities of received emotional support. These findings suggest that providing emotional support can be an efficacious response to terrorism-related stress."

Much of research on U.S. press coverage of oppositional voices against U.S. war policy indicates that dissent voices are limited in the absence of U.S. official oppositions. However, media balance norm and attraction to conflicts might lead the press actively to seek dissent voices. Our findings show that the New York Times maintained relatively constant level of coverage of opposition. However, dissent voices from various sources were differently framed according to their legitimacy, relevance and the need for application of balancing norm."

In cases like these, neither benefits from the unique approach nor the subsequent findings of the other. While studies in enrollment management have shown that teacher/student relationship is one factor that can positively affect retention especially in the case of minority students, very little of that research has explored how to accomplish this sense of relating via communication. On the other hand, human communication researchers have studied many aspects of teacher immediacy in intercultural contexts without exploring its application to retention. Given the understanding that both of these areas of study have been rightfully focused on their own objectives, it is expected that a fusion of the two could have sustained positive effects on keeping students in school. The goal of this paper is to connect these two areas of research as a foundation for first understanding the role of teacher communication in retention and in making subsequent research-based proposals for maximizing the potential of teachers as key players in the enrollment management funnel."

Results show that students who are high in communication apprehension and/or less immediate perceive instructors as less immediate and less assertive/responsive, and students who are more apprehensive and/or less immediate are less satisfied with instructors and feel that they learn less. Students’ assertiveness/responsiveness was positively correlated with perceptions of instructors’immediacy, assertiveness/responsiveness, satisfaction with the instructor, and classroom learning."

We divided the respondents into the four acculturation types(Integration, Assimilation, Separation, Marginalization) using North Korean and South Korean Acculturation Identity Scale. After that, we have analyzed the use of mass media and perception thereof with respect to mass communication, the correlations between a number of friends and a number of hours spent talking with friends with respect to interpersonal communication, and finally differences in the level of efficacy between the four acculturation types with respect to intrapersonal communication. The results of our study indicate that TV is the most affecting media channel for the young North Korean refugees. Secondly, an integration type person tends to have more South Korean friends as opposed to a marginalization type person. From that, we can construe that it is better for the young North Korean refugees to have more South Korean friends in their acculturation processes. However, an integration type individual has a tendency of maintaining weak ties with the outside world. An individual with weak ties to the outside world has an advantage of being able to maintain personal relationships that may be shallow to some extent but widen their viewpoints through these relationships. Finally, the level of interpersonal efficacy among the four acculturation types is shown to be the highest in the integration type, followed by the assimilation type, the separation type and the marginalization type."

The findings indicated that the subordinates in this study categorized their relationships with their supervisors as friendships, non-friendships/professionals, or family. Subordinates who reported being friends with their bosses, most often Caucasian Americans, seemed also to indicate having more rewarding superior-subordinate interactions. These relationships with their bosses opened other doors for them in there respective companies. Subordinates seeking or being afforded only non-friend/professional relationships with their bosses seemed to enjoy fewer professional favors or privileges than their counterparts. African American women, more so than other groups, tended to reveal having only professional relationships with their supervisors. Additionally, Latino/a American subordinates often had friendships with their bosses but many maintained that the likelihood or the quality of these friendships varied across races. The subordinates in this study who reported to family members were Caucasian American, and they appeared to have more genuine and personal dialogue with their supervisors than other groups."

The premise of the present study is that cognitive aspects of suspicious receivers must be accounted for to further understand their active participation in deceptive communication. The present study attempts to identify suspicious receivers interaction goals and strategic behaviors and to find links between the goals and behaviors. The influence of situational and affective factors on suspicious receivers goals and behaviors are also investigated. Data were collected from one hundred and eighty two undergraduate students within dating relationships. The results revealed four interaction goals and nine behavior categories of suspicious receivers in dating relationship. Some qualitative differences between the goals were found in terms of their association with behavioral strategies. Also, outcome involvement, relational commitment, and emotional intensity were found to have important influences on suspicious receivers behaviors. Implications for future suspicion research are discussed as well as the studys limitations."

First, it identifies the three distinctive public relations theories that each lends its basis to the systems, rhetorical, and critical approaches. Second, it illustrates an integrated view towards the public relations theories with the goal of building a stronger form of communications and relationship building.
The new paradigmatic approach enhances the diversity of public relations theories and expands the public relations body of knowledge to the interpersonal, organizational, and social level. Practicing public relations under the new paradigm represents a wide range of communication activities to harmonize diverse opinions, resolve conflicts, and build a lasting relationship between the organization and the public. Acknowledging that public relations does not represent communication activities dedicated to a particular organization or a group, the new public relations paradigm leads to a larger sphere of public communications accompanied by a deeper consideration towards the powerless, social meanings, social responsibility, ethical practices, and concurrence among social members."

Research indicates that media, advertising in particular, can create and sustain unrealistic images and stereotypes, especially of women. It is important to examine how the portrayal of women in advertising has changed over the past decades. Preliminary data analysis shows that across all magazine genres, in 2004, males appeared demurely dressed 83.5 percent of the time, while women are only shown as demurely dressed a third of the time. This enormous discrepancy in the level of dress between male and female models indicates that women are portrayed much more often as sexual objects than are men. This study will hopefully advance feminist scholarship through the thorough documentation of the trend of inequality in the portrayal of sexuality and gender roles of females in the past and today."

One possible explanation for unsuccessful feedback is that subordinates may take feedback personally. A pilot study probed for such instances during superior-to-subordinate performance feedback. The main study replicated and extended the initial findings. Results suggested that before taking performance feedback personally, subordinates believed they were competent at the task and trusted their supervisor to support this belief. Compared with those who did not, subordinates who took feedback personally experienced more anger and discouragement and less agreement toward and less willingness to comply with the feedback. Whether these subordinates actually complied less was inconclusive, though when they complied, they complied begrudgingly."

Childrens Uses of the Internet For Education, Communication and Participation",Teens and Media and Online Technology Literacy,"The research project, UK Children Go Online (UKCGO), combines qualitative research with a national survey of 9-19 year olds to investigate how the internet may be transforming, or may itself be shaped by family life, peer networks and school. This paper focuses on some key opportunities the internet affords to young people. While the internet has rapidly become central to young people as an information medium, it is far from unproblematic for they encounter difficulties with searching the web and with critical evaluation of websites, partly because of patchy educational support for internet literacy teaching. While education is the approved use of the internet, justifying parents and governments investment in domestic access, children and young people are more excited by its communication benefits. Both internet (instant message, email, chat) and mobile phone (talk, text) are heavily used to contact local friends especially and, through skilful choices regarding both technological features and communicative purpose, they are employed to manage communication concerns with intimacy, embarrassment and privacy, being thus at times more satisfactory than face-to-face communication. Although such communication sustains the peer network, this does not necessarily generate a wider interest in community or civic participation. Nor do all young people benefit from these new opportunities equally. The paper concludes by charting the emergence of a new divide between those for whom the internet is an increasingly rich and stimulating resource of considerable value in their lives and those for whom it remains narrow and unengaging if occasionally useful."

Employing content analysis of differing media including newspapers, magazines, TV and Internet web pages, I explore how these two players are consistently presented by Japanese media as different cultural types, reflecting differing values. At the same time, both stimulate expressions of national pride and distinct (national) cultural values under conditions of globalization.

To an extent greater than other sports, Japans baseball serves as a cultural performance (Shimizu 1998) in which Japanese cultural values are embodied and crystallized. I show that this is particularly true when it comes to baseball stars, who are heavily implicated in popular cultural communication. Their public reputations are not always based on achievements in the field; instead, they are often interpreted, celebrated and/or publicly reproached in terms of their adherence to fundamental cultural values. In the media lens, players serve as sites for mass socialization of the audience (Andrews and Jackson 2001)  specifically, consumption and (re)production of Japanese cultural values.

Intellectually, this is important for reasons ranging from globalization (e.g. Appadurai 1992) to media culture (Kellner 1994). Through the guise of sports celebrities toiling in a foreign land we see how indigenous values and nationalism are continually brought into relief in the discussion of sports globalization (Holden 2003). This discussion tends to neglect the fact that Japans American-based players both reflect and embrace a diversification of Japanese cultural values."

Media campaigns emphasize the importance of parents speaking with their children about the dangers of drugs, yet less research has directly assessed which factors can improve parent-child communication. This research addresses the conditions in which families are inclined to discuss drug use, in two distinct cultures  the United States and Singapore. Through a path model, we determined that shared family values and communication patterns both contribute to decreases in drug usage and increases in risk talk, while television viewing increases the likelihood of risk behaviors. Implications and recommendations for policy and preventive communication are discussed."

According to theories of deliberative democracy, high-quality opinions emerge through free and equal exchange, encouraging give-and-take and inviting arguments for all sides. This study explores empirical patterns of citizen discussions online, set against normative standards of deliberative theory. We examine a set of unique data obtained from sixty groups, assembled from a random sample of Americans, which engaged in a series of monthly, real-time electronic discussions during the 2000 presidential campaign. Extensive surveys assessed participants' opinions, communication behaviors, knowledge of public affairs, and a variety of other relevant background variables. The full text of all group discussions was also recorded, and patterns in group argumentation determined through extensive content analysis. These data were analyzed to learn more about who deliberates, patterns of argumentation among different sorts of participants, and the extent to which these patterns are predicted by various survey measures including demographics, ideological dispositions, political knowledge and involvement, and other individual differences."

There is a call by African scholars to engage in qualitative study and intervention-based research that will lead to a better understanding of why current HIV programs in Africa are failing to produce the desired results. The conviction in this research is that by examining this issue from the point of view of how Africans ""talk"" about HIV/AIDS, some insights may be uncovered as to why the current programs are not working. The project is based on the belief that discourse has the ability to not only generate meaning, but also to enable and constrain the expression of peoples ideas and, most importantly, their actions. It thus follows that language and discourse on HIV/AIDS in the African context should be examined."

Specifically, I focus on the formation of a collective identity within the European Union against U.S. dominance through audiovisual policy-making.
In doing this I use Saids work on the relationship between the textual production of colonial meanings and the consolidation of colonial hegemony. I argue that U.S. economic dominance over the European audiovisual space has resulted in the colonization of European (audio)visual imagery. Narrative conventions, visual tropes and storylines found in Hollywood film and U.S. television have become the norm for the European audience. These modes of representation have also had an impact on the ways in which most Europeans have learned how to know reality. This does not mean that Europeans have become completely and passively Americanized, but that a U.S.-based system of representation has informed their identities in meaningful ways.
In my analysis, I address three main theoretical concepts as they relate to a chosen artifact. These concepts are textuality (Said, 1979), symbolic capital (Bourdieu, 1991) and strategy/tactics (Foucault, 1980). I use these concepts to analyze the website of the CineDays film festival, which was created by the European Commission to promote European cinema and to ""talk back"" at the U.S. audiovisual industry. Based on this analysis, I then offer a critique of the EUs oppositional strategy of identity formation as it relates to the creation of a new habitus among European viewers."

The coding scheme was adapted from the National Television Violence Study and past research on televised verbal aggression. The results show that an abundance of verbal aggression is present in televised professional wrestling. In particular, swearing, competence attacks, and character attacks. Notably, these forms of aggression are committed most often by perpetrators with no clear dispositional characteristics, and without any apparently justifiable reason  most often done seemingly just for amusement. The results are discussed in terms of potential effects of exposure to the verbal aggression found in professional wrestling."

The first study developed a typology of eight core parental drug prevention strategies, derived from a recall listing of parental strategies used to prevent drug use as recounted by 421 offspring. The second study identified a three factor structure for parental strategies for talking about drugs; a my responsibility orientation, your responsibility orientation, and an our responsibility orientation. This study also examined the relationship between these strategies and parent-offspring communication orientation. In the third study, a linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate if any of the three different parental orientations negatively predicted substance use within a first-year college sample. Results revealed that the your responsibility orientation was a significant positive predictor of marijuana use, but not alcohol or tobacco use. Moreover, one-way analysis of variance indicated that parental neglect of prevention strategies entirely was significantly related to offsprings recent tobacco and alcohol use."
2005-1423,"Talk Radio Listening, Opinion Expression and Political Discussion in a Democratizing Society",Media Influences on Public Opinion,Political Communication,,,Paper,"Talk Radio Listening, Opinion Expression and Political Discussion in a Democratizing Society",Media Influences on Public Opinion,"Public discussion is important for the functioning of a democratic society, while the mass media have an important role to play in facilitating public debate. Based upon these premises, the present study examines talk radio listening as an opinion activity in Hong Kong, a society undergoing a process of gradual democratization. More specifically, the analysis examines the relationship between talk radio listening and citizens opinion expressions and political discussions in a number of contexts. The results show that talk radio listeners discuss about public affairs with their friends and family more frequently. They are also more expressive in the survey interview situation and in situations in which they are holding the minority opinions. There is suggestive evidence showing talk radio listeners as more likely to talk to strangers about politics online. Furthermore, talk radio listeners are more likely to participate in both voting and protests, and talk radio listening is related to more positive attitudes towards the values of political debates in society. Such relationships, however, seem to be conditioned by a number of factors in a complicated manner, with audience pre-existing attitudes, contents of the radio talk shows, and the degree of public-ness of the discussion context all being potentially relevant. The results of the study are discussed in relation to both the context of media and politics in Hong Kong as well as the study of talk radio and political communication in general."

Microanalysis of discourse, incorporated into cultural analysis, offers a way to understand how organizational members construct their workplace environment through their everyday interactions. Part of a three-year analysis of cultural change in a high-technology public bureaucracy, this paper focuses on the cultural micropractices of a computing-services management team. Specifically, it offers a close reading of team discourse to discover the ways in which this team engages in humor, reproducing past practices and thus sustaining a recognizable subculture within the IT department of focus. As the analysis develops, a paradox unfolds. The team reproduces the computing services work culture; however, the visible contrast of the team culture within the IT department appears as resistance to organizational change. Yet the reproduction of computing cultural practices serves to reinforce the public bureaucratic hierarchy rather than offering a balancing voice within the department. The paradox of this teams influence on the IT department is understood through the micropractices of team humor."

In this paper, we present a study that focuses on the contribution of information and communication technology or ICT to this process of building a common store of knowledge  or knowledge sharing  in communities of practice. First, we distinguish two central processes of knowledge sharing: knowledge donating and knowledge collecting. Then, we discuss how communities of practice create social capital, and how such social capital positively influences both knowledge donating and knowledge collecting. As building a common store of knowledge is a form of collective action, we next discuss a collective action perspective on ICT, which focuses on two public goods that ICT helps create: communality (a collective store of information) and connectivity (the ability to reach other members of a community). In order for such public goods to be created, collective use of ICT is necessary, and perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and experience with the technology are identified as factors that influence such use. We present a theoretical model that was tested in two communities of practice. The results generally support our theoretical arguments that collective use of ICT has a potentially positive contribution to knowledge sharing in communities of practice. We also distinguish a learning process in the use of ICT and in knowl-edge sharing, and on the basis of this, call for longitudinal research in this area."
2005-1426,Technology Clusters: Using Metric Multidimensional Scaling to Evaluate and Structure Technology Clusters,The Structures of the Web and New Technologies,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,Technology Clusters: Using Metric Multidimensional Scaling to Evaluate and Structure Technology Clusters,The Structures of the Web and New Technologies,"Recent research in the diffusion of innovations paradigm seems to suggest that technology clusters are often superior predictors of adoption, rather than the more conventional measures of innovation attributes. However, the treatment of technology clusters by communication researchers has often been inconsistent. For the most part the measurement approach has been ad-hoc with lists of potential clusters or related technologies being formulated without any systematic reasoning other than some apriori assumptions about cluster relationship. Often, the technologies included have no isomorphic relationship with the technology being adopted. The current research systematically evaluates the composition of technology clusters, and the boundaries of innovations. To this end, the study employs metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) using the Galileo system to map out the perceived dissimilarities between thirty telecommunication innovations. The map would provide spatial measures of cluster membership, distance, and centrality, and help accurately determine the boundaries of technologies. The results will be compared across adopter categories to measure the perceived differences in technology cluster composition."
2005-1427,Technology Convergence and Regulatory Challenge,Korean Communication Law and Policy: One Nation with Multiple Issues,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,Technology Convergence and Regulatory Challenge,Korean Communication Law and Policy: One Nation with Multiple Issues,"From a technical perspective, the convergence between telecommunications and broadcasting now emerges as both industries move towards digital standards. Yet from a policy perspective, convergence seems not be ready yet and may not be desirable. This study surveys the current convergence of broadcasting and telecommunication, examines the policy questions which arise in Korea and presents review of current regulation in this field. In particular, this study focuses on digital media broadcasting service which is currently being developed in Korea. It suggests the perspectives on forthcoming satellite DMB service developments, and implications to cope with this emerging technological breakthrough. This study indicates that current broadcasting-based regulatory framework may have a room for deterring technological convergence and thus delay service introduction in market. It concludes with new regulation model in consideration of service providers and users perspective."
2005-1428,"Telecommunications, Spatial Infrastructure, and Spatial Interaction: Looking Through the Case of Seoul",Borderless Colonies,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,"Telecommunications, Spatial Infrastructure, and Spatial Interaction: Looking Through the Case of Seoul",Borderless Colonies,"The history of telecommunications development has often been thought as a force that dilutes the notion of geographical space and boundaries in contemporary society. This paper attempts to give an understanding of the interactive mechanism between the spatial characteristics of a city and the patterns of changes brought by the diffusion of technology. This paper includes a case study of Seoul, the capital city of Korea, which is regarded as displaying a remarkable speed and scope in the diffusion of new information and communication technologies. Through observing the pattern of interaction grounded upon actual physical space and the regional efforts to reconstruct spaces of the city, it is assessed that the notion of geographical space is still crucial for understanding the technological landscape in the midst of digital technologies driving people toward virtual space and virtual reality. From a multi-level perspective, it is examined that the spatial infrastructure of city influences the pattern of technological development, consequently transforming spatial interaction including the pattern of individual lifestyle and the interaction among people based on urban space. Micro-, meso-, and macro-level forces interact with each other and subsequently influence the spatial infrastructure of a city. A case analysis on the background spatial characteristics of Seoul and the recent trend of major transformations is given to help understand this interactive mechanism."

While a variety of economic and policy-related factors affect the outcomes of telecommunications reforms in developing countries, other more general factors may play a significant role in setting the stage for the shape of the system that evolves. There is some evidence to suggest that history, in this case the history of colonization, independence and post-independence relationships, may have influenced the development of telecommunications systems in some African countries."

Identity, Relationships, and Group Behavior in Instant Messaging Communication",tant Messaging Usage,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,"Telegraph Lines in Cyperspace? Identity, Relationships, and Group Behavior in Instant Messaging Communication",Instant Messaging Usage,"Instant Messaging has become one of the major applications on the Internet. It supports textual, fast-paced one-to-one communication and it can facilitate the establishment and maintenance of interpersonal relations.

The paper presents some of the findings of a research project in Germany on the users and uses of Instant Messaging. We focus on how Instant Messaging is incorporated into interpersonal communication, how it affects relationships and the identity construction during the communication process. We also discuss the impact on communication inside of groups and what role Instant Messaging communication plays there. We will touch on several questions: Are fictional identities common in Instant Messaging communication, and what gratifications can they promise? What role plays Instant Messaging in groups of online gamers or high-school students? What can we learn about the network-building features of Instant Messaging?

The data we present is based on 54 qualitative interviews, 8 group discussions and a web-based survey with more than 10.000 participants, collected in 2003."
2005-1431,Televised Sports and GAM: An Extension of the General Aggression Model,Aggression & Violence,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Televised Sports and GAM: An Extension of the General Aggression Model,Aggression & Violence,"Previous research attempting to answer the question of why exposure to media violence leads to subsequent aggression has led to the formation of the General Aggression Model (GAM) (Anderson & Bushman, 2002a). This paper attempts to extend the findings of the GAM by testing it with a situational variable that has received very little attention in media violence literature to date: televised sports. More specifically, it examines the effects that violent sports have on the formation of a hostile expectancy bias, as tested previously with video games (Bushman & Anderson, 2002). It also examines the impact of the scripted nature of the sport on this relationship, as differentiated previously by Depalma and Raney (2002).
One hundred and thirty-nine undergraduates were recruited from an introductory communication course to participate in this study. After giving their consent they were exposed to one of four sports clips: scripted violent (professional wrestling), scripted non-violent (pairs figure skating), non-scripted violent (boxing), or non-scripted non-violent (baseball). Following exposure, each subject was given three incomplete story stems to complete (as used by Bushman & Anderson, 2002), as well as a series of other questionnaires. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that violent sports lead to a greater formation of a hostile expectancy bias than nonviolent sports. The scripted nature of the sport was found to moderate the relationship. The robustness of these relationships is also discussed. Limitations and implications of the study are then discussed, as are suggestions for future research."

Research and data have emerged, which indicate media use is related to ingroup perceptions of the intergroup context. However, little is known about the relationship between media and outgroups perceptions of the intergroup context. The current study attempts to advance this line of research by investigating the relationship between African Americans media activity and their perceptions of Caucasian and Hispanic vitality. Two hypotheses are offered based on Cultivation Theory, and a set of research questions are asked based on the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach. Results indicate the U&G approach is more robust than Cultivation Theory in predicting African Americans vitality perceptions of Caucasian and Hispanic vitality."
2005-1452,Television coverage of Operation Iraqi Freedom: The frames that made news,Public Opinion in War Time,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Television coverage of Operation Iraqi Freedom: The frames that made news,Public Opinion in War Time,"Extant research on the media coverage of the Gulf War demonstrates that the media tend to reflect the political ideologies of the mother nation, actively participating in the generation of political support for national policy. A large number of studies on news reports of the Gulf War pointed out that the media constructed the war as a military operation, highlighting military strategies and the triumph of technology, whereas the casualties of the war were omitted. More than a decade after the Gulf War, the United States and Iraq engaged again as key stakeholders in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This article examines the frames present in the media coverage of Operation Iraqi Freedom based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of the war coverage on CNN and Fox. Hypotheses also are tested regarding the favorability of specific frames toward key stakeholders."
2005-1453,Television Dramas and Support for Controversial Public Policies: Effects and Mechanisms,Media & Current Issues,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Television Dramas and Support for Controversial Public Policies: Effects and Mechanisms,Media & Current Issues,"In this experiment, we examine effects of television dramas on support for controversial public policy (i.e., gay marriage and the death penalty), and explore mechanisms that may explain such effects. The dramas influenced support for death penalty but not gay marriage. Effects on death penalty support were a function of ideology: as predicted, exposure to the relevant drama reduced the relationship between prior ideology and death penalty support; moreover, the valence of the relationship between prior (liberal) ideology and salience of a relevant value (perceived importance of a safe and crime-free society) went from negative in the comparison condition to positive after exposure to the relevant drama. These and other results suggest that a persuasive narrative influences policy support by reframing the dramatic situation to reduce the effect of prior ideology and minimize processing of the story as persuasive discourse."
2005-1454,Television Entertainment as Festive Culture. Towards an Interactive Model of Signification,llusions and Evasions in Subcultural Spectacles,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Television Entertainment as Festive Culture. Towards an Interactive Model of Signification,Illusions and Evasions in Subcultural Spectacles,"In classic media criticism, television entertainment is invariably viewed as a corrupt form of mass distraction, a way of exploiting and diverting an oppressed public. In response to this deterministic view, it has frequently been pointed out that producers and consumers operate independently of each other, each within their own social setting. The result of constantly stressing this separation, however, is to lose sight of the interactions between the two and the associated broader social context. This article puts forward an alternative theory for the study of television entertainment, interpreting its production and consumption as a coherent cultural phenomenon, specifically as a form of festive culture. We find that other parties besides producers and consumers, such as participants and power configurations, play an important role: significance is attributed to television entertainment in a dynamic, multi-actor process. This approach is visualized in a model. Public opinion research, interviews with participants and analysis of the content of the longest-running entertainment programme on Dutch television are used to show how the model can be applied in practice."

Women are undervalued as athletes, due to their perceived lack of athletic skill and competitive spirit. This paper demonstrates, via self-report measures, that male and female subjects experience different levels of dominance while watching sports featuring male and female athletes. Also discussed is the effect on feelings of dominance while watching athletes that participate in sports that are believed to not be gender-appropriate."

Participants were 411 adolescent girls (ages 14-16) who completed self-report measures on body dissatisfaction, television viewing, and concerns about appearance expectations. Our results indicated that there was both a direct and indirect relationship between romantic youth drama viewing and body satisfaction. Girls who spent more time watching romantic youth drama displayed lower levels of body satisfaction. In addition, romantic youth drama viewing had a significant positive impact on concerns about boys attractiveness expectations. Those expectations influenced body satisfaction."

In this paper, these relationships are re-investigated in a younger sample. Furthermore, the moderating influence of sexual experience is examined: does real-life sexual experience reinforce the effect of television exposure, or does it make the expected relationships disappear? Respondents from a sample of 12- to 15-year-olds (N = 2121) reported on their viewing diet, estimated the prevalence of given sexual activities, and rated stereotypes about males as being preoccupied with sex, males as dominating sexual relations, and sex as a purely physical activity. Results demonstrated connections between television viewing and sexual beliefs. More specifically, greater exposure to early evening comedy series, youth action series, soap operas and late evening action series were repeatedly associated to sexual attitudes. Further exploration showed that some of these relationships become stronger as sexual experience levels progress."

Some of the partners were described with only attractive characteristics, some with only risky characteristics, and some with a mixture of attractive and risky characteristics. Compared to low sensation seekers, high sensation seekers rated the partners as more attractive and gave higher likelihood ratings of going on a date and having sex with the partner, but lower likelihood ratings of getting infected with an STD/HIV. Respondents tended to ask for more information about partners they found attractive and less detail on those they did not find attractive. Further, the valence of the information requested became more positive as the partner was described in increasingly positive terms. High sensation seekers consistently sought more information about potential partners than did low sensation seekers, and were also more likely to seek information about risky attributes of the potential partner, e.g., multiple sex partners or drug use. Implications for internet dating and for disease prevention campaigns are discussed."

Sports programming from 2000-2002 is examined for both traditional commercials as well as nontraditional advertising methods, such as signs on scoreboards, decals on race cars, and voice-over sponsor announcements by broadcasters. Nontraditional advertising is of particular interest in the case of tobacco, which by law is not permitted to be advertised in television commercials, and which in 1998 was confronted with extensive legal restriction of its sports sponsorship. The levels of traditional and nontraditional advertising for alcohol and tobacco are considered across type of sport, across category of sport (college, professional major, or other), and as compared to the findings of the earlier studies.

The results indicate that while many forms of alcohol and tobacco promotion have decreased, traditional commercials and voice-over sponsorship messages still occur at high levels in many sports. Additionally, a disturbing trend is noted whereby alcohol and tobacco companies are able to get their brand names in front of television audiences by including them in ads for other products, such as a Viagra ad that features a race car with tobacco and alcohol brand decals on it. The incidence of this type of advertising is significant, and demonstrates the creative resiliency of alcohol and tobacco marketers when faced with advertising restrictions."

The aims of such actions can be to gain media coverage, to spread fear, communicate discontent and/or exercise political pressure. Analyzes of the rhetoric and the resources of the involved organizations can shed light on why a particular action was chosen over others and how an organization has influenced a political conflict. In this paper, three cases are examined with an emphasis on the visual dimension of the actors strategies. It is pointed to how knowledge about visual rhetoric and media logic constitutes a resource and how visual rhetoric excels on several accounts in comparison with verbal rhetoric."

A secondary aim was to examine whether students versus non-student adults responded differently to the Internet sponsorships. The authors conceptualized the line between news and advertising in terms of how closely the sponsors product associated with the news. The method was a 3 (sponsor association) x 2 (section) x 4 (newspapers) x 4 (news story) factorial experiment. The participants were 110 students and 81 non-student adults. The high sponsorship association condition significantly decreased the credibility of the e-newspapers. Students and non-students significantly differed with regard to memory for the content, and credibility and behavioral intent for the e-newspapers."

We tested the central propositions of the RPA framework in the context of maternal health among women residents of Burkina Faso. As predicted, the interaction between risk perception and efficacy beliefs was significantly associated with knowledge about maternal health. As efficacy increased, the relationship between knowledge and risk perception increased, and as efficacy decreased, the relationship between knowledge and risk perception decreased. These findings have important implications for message design and audience targeting."

The researcher employs narrative methodology in order to understand their acculturative experiences. Thematic analysis of in-depth, conversational interview capta are also used. Emergent themes from these narrative interviews were found in regard to the participants acculturative experiences of studying in a foreign country. Those themes are discussed in the order of the participants experience: (1) The theme of culture shock, (2) the theme of acculturative stress, (3), the theme of linguistic limitations, and (4) the theme of culture adjustment. From the narratives, it appears that, overall, the French participants report difficulties in crossing linguistic and cultural boundaries while studying in an American university. Besides, as they experience the American lifestyle, study habits, culture (i.e., sports like football), values, and traditions, they also face difficult emotions. Emotions such as uncertainty and confusion are their reactions to such a life transition, and are sometimes very challenging to adjust to their American surroundings."

In modern coinage, this freedom and this objectivity, indeed the power which is ascribed to both, is called ambivalence, and the critical position of ambivalence serves to expose the methods by which a nation conceives of and naturalizes those conceptions of the Others of all types: racial, social, sexual, etc., within its own borders. I apply this theory by looking at the Decadent writers of19th century Fin de Siécle Europe, who were acting in ambivalence to the excesses of bourgeois society, and the Rave community of 20th century Fin de Siécle Europe and America, who were equally ambivalent to neo-liberal Reagan and Thatcherite culture. Both had to contend with the trappings of mass society, and the leveling of all distinction; both were faced with the politics of exclusion, and both reacted to it in similar ways: the Decadents lived the Stranger in their art, their way of life, and on their own bodies; the rave community lived this in their music, their method, and their style."

Scholars have been particularly interested in the effects of the Internet on the community. Adopting a techno-deterministic frame, lot of the early work on the Internet conceptualized the medium as the cause of the decline in community participation. This paper offers an alternative position. Based on social shaping of technology and channel complementarity theories, it proposes that community participation will be positively related with community-based Internet use. In addition, it posits that satisfaction with the community will emerge as a positive predictor."

By conducting a textual analysis, the study finds that the NYT applied episodic framing and historical analogies to the coverage of the issue, and concludes that these strategies of news discourse reflect Greenstones explanation of reform liberalism. The study includes a theoretical discussion of American liberalism, characterized as a bipolar liberal tradition: humanist liberalism and reform liberalism. It also discusses the implication of applying a relatively disregarded political theory to media content."

Unlike other early stations, CBS chose to develop a different approach to news on television.
CBS devoted more time to news in the late afternoon/early evening hours in 1941-1942 than at any other time in the networks television history. In addition, the CBS-TV crew learned important lessons on how to handle breaking news with the attack on Pearl Harbor and the countrys entry into World War II.
Utilizing oral history interviews, government documents, company records, and other historical research methods, this project unearths an important era in the development of broadcast journalism. The CBS team was developing processes, negotiating technology, and structuring a newscast format which would be in place when millions of Americans turned down their radios and switched on their televisions."

Queer studies is discussed in terms of its focus on sexuality which tends to neglect other identities and circumstances that are part of a broader system of social relations. The contributions of political economy and cultural studies to queer media analysis are analyzed. Four areas, in addition to sexuality, are identified as necessary for qualitative analysis of mediated images of sexuality: gender, race, class, and economic and media globalization."

The focus on the body in pain leads us to reconsider the current discussion of the public sphere that is usually limited to the bonds of reason and words. Given that there are few famous subaltern speakers or memorable speeches, the body rhetoric of self-immolation in South Korea can throw light on how the subaltern can speak, where there is no space from which the subject can speak. Arguing that there are rhetorical and political dimensions of the body in pain, this paper complicates the issue of embodiment in the public sphere, providing a new form of self-suspension practiced by subaltern counterpublics distinguished from self-abstraction by the liberal subject."

This paper will report on a case study of journalists participation in the social construction of this authority. The case involves media coverage of controversial scientific research conducted by a tenured professor at Harvard Medical School, Pulitzer Prize winner, and well known authority in his field. When this elite scientist embarked upon the study of people who believe they have been abducted by aliens he drew fire for stepping outside the boundaries of real science, despite his stellar credentials. The boundaries of science and scientific authority were tested in this case, and journalists played a role.

Employing the sensitizing concept of boundary-work to guide analysis of media content, this study explores how journalists constructed scientific authority in their coverage of Macks abduction research, and to what ends, how journalistic norms operated in media coverage. Rhetoric is a primary tool for constructing social reality, and the rhetoric of science is a key source of the cultural authority of science. Burkes dramatistic criticism is thus employed as a primary analytic tool in this study, to excavate the landscape of symbolic action. It is intended to be thought provoking, instructive, and productive, to enrich the ongoing examination of the cultural roles of journalism and of science."

More specifically, Chinese women of different eras attempt to highlight their appearance with regard to the ways they perceive the ideal of beauty. I would argue that the changing face/appearance of Chinese women against a vast historical backdrop reflects the changing of their social status and identity."

Better not to Do Anything Wrong: How Chinese Working-Class Immigrant Women Negotiate Racial/Ethnic Identities and Inter-racial and Inter-ethnic Tensions,Negotiating Cultural Identities,"As part of a larger project, which examines the racial/ethnic, gender, class, and cultural identities of Chinese immigrant working-class women, this paper focuses on how immigrant woman workers negotiate their racial/ethnic identities in particular. The researcher spent one year in the San Francisco Bay Area doing fieldwork among Chinese immigrant woman workers and found out that, upon migration, these women have gone through horrible experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination. In reaction, they have developed a strong Chinese nationalist sentiment and a collective ethnic identity. However, when they withdraw to their nationalist sentiment, the host society does not hesitate to use the withdrawal as a pretext to question their loyalty and to further deny their due rights as American citizens. With limited opportunities and life needs at the doorstep, the women often find it necessary to adopt certain white cultural norms. But they have never stopped negotiating with external racial oppressions and white supremacist ideas. In this process of negotiation, Chinese ethnic media messages have both liberating and paralyzing influences."

Not surprisingly, Al-Jazeera viewers rated the network as highly credible on all measures. They rated CNN and BBC high on expertise, but ranked it low on trustworthiness. Consequently, BBC and CNN were also rated low on other credibility measures. Local Arab media were judged lowest on all credibility measures. Those who were younger and who relied heavily on Al-Jazeera were more likely to judge the network as credible."

Total must carry, also known as multiple must carry, multichannel must carry and multicast must carry, has surfaced as the most recent, most contentious, incarnation of the must carry debate. At issue is whether a cable operator is required by the 1992 Cable Act to carry all video streams (total carriage) of a digital television broadcaster. This paper examines the multi-faceted debates over total carriage by examining the individuals and groups on each side of the debate, as well as the arguments they put forth. Additionally, this paper examines what the possible outcomes of the debate will mean for the broadcasting group that is often overlooked in these discussions: public broadcasting stations."

Forty-nine participants produced a total of 483 messages, which were analyzed for their speech act composition and for the presence of specialized language conventions (e.g., LOL). The speech act analysis indicated that messages were primarily constructed of assertive, followed by commissives and expressive speech acts, with directive, effective and verdictives speech acts being produced the least. Approximately one third of away messages involved a language convention, while one fifth involved a quotation (e.g., a famous quote, a song lyric, a hyperlink, etc.). These conventions were most frequently employed for expressive speech acts. Taken together, this data suggests that away messages are primarily used for informational and expressive purposes as they increase awareness regarding a users current status, activity, or beliefs."

The Swedish Press and the 'Reichskristallnacht'.,"Journalism, Politics and Democracy: International Perspectives (A High Density Panel)","This paper investigates the interplay between journalism and in politics in relation to the radicalization of the Nazi anti-Semitism. Recent years' scholarship into the history of the Holocaust has not least drawn attention to the international reactions to the Jewish fate. To what extent were governments and public opinions cognizant as to what happened in Nazi ruled areas? To what extent did they act as gainers, helpers or indifferent bystanders?

The paper tries to demonstrate the need for a media theoretically informed analysis in order to assess the significance of the contemporary reporting. Historians have described Sweden's position during the years of persecution and the first phase of the Holocaust as 'indifferent'. The focus is here on the coverage of the 'Reichskristallnacht', using a representative selection of dailies while letting the period of examination also span over the months before and after the November pogrom.

Contrary to earlier beliefs recent research has showed that much information about the plight of the European Jewry was at hand in the allied and neutral countries. This investigation confirms that picture, the reporting was detailed and extensive. Thus the meaning of the reporting becomes crucial.

By applying discourse analysis the paper argues that the leading newspapers from different political camps moulded a public disposition for indifference, were susceptible to increased anti-Semitism, and isolated the few dissident voices."

Using quantitative and qualitative content analysis of randomly selected Web sites from the 2004 Fortune 500 list, the authors found that most Fortune 500 companies focus on content that introduces the company and its positions, and attempts to sell the company as an employer. The persuasive movements employed on career sites include sketching the companys values, objectives, and credentials, building a case for the company as an employer of choice, sampling the workplace, and enabling the job search and application process. The representations of work displayed on career sites depict work as career-building, workers as agents, and employers as benefactors. These representations are critiqued in context of current reports on working conditions as well as Marxist critical theory."

Although broadening the focus of Human Computer Interaction research, these studies have offered only partial models for explaining how cultural factors affect the process of Web-related content design. Inspired by Vygotsky and Nisbett, we propose a broader model, by which Web design, like other types of information production, is seen as being shaped by specific cultural-psychological thinking styles. The paper explores issues related to designer cultural cognitive style positing that a number of task-based measures may show if and how diverse cultural Web users respond to content created by designers from their own or other cultures. We expect that variations in cognitive style of Web designers, as reflected in the Web content they have designed, may affect variations of online user performance and preferences."

For example, most people are unaware that one indigenous language disappears, on average, every two weeks. According to scientists, with each language extinction not only does a culture lose its identity, but the world loses local knowledge in medicine, resource management, as well as innovative ways of understanding the world. Employing Entman's (1993) approach to frame analysis, this study analyzes how international news wire agencies frame the issue of endangered languages and considers how the resulting media portrayal might, ultimately, relate to public and policymakers' understanding of the issue. The results reveal three distinct media frames common across a variety of international sources -- each of which, however, tend to promote an atmosphere of 'benign neglect' regarding endangered languages, rather than highlight language extinction as a problem with potentially serious cultural and scientific implications."

Specifically, participants were invited to discuss and comment on the 1992 presidential and vice presidential debates. Using a conversation analysis, this study investigated the dynamics of power negotiation among conversationalists who are of different socio-cultural backgrounds. Particularly, it examined the powerful/powerless language use, speaking turns, and interruptions of the interviewees, as well as the interviewers role in this live television interview. Results indicated that gender, language style, speaking turn, or social status alone can not serve as a valid indicator for influence ranking; rather, we must adopt a dynamic approach to the study of small group conversation, which involves an interplay of language use, context, social status, roles, and interactions."
2005-1506,The Deliberative Citizen,Uses and Effects of Online Deliberation,Political Communication,,,Paper,The Deliberative Citizen,Uses and Effects of Online Deliberation,"The Deliberative Voter

A great deal of evidence supports the propositions that most people are not well informed about politics or policy and tend to discuss politics mainly with similar people holding similar views. That leaves the question of how a more ideal publicbetter informed, more reflective, and exposed to a wider range of fellow citizens and opinionswould have voted. What, moreover, would have underlain their votes? What would their policy views, candidate evaluations, and other underlying political attitudes have been like?

We consider these questions with evidence from an online Deliberative Poll conducted with a national random sample during the 2004 Presidential election campaign. The online Deliberative Poll drew an RDD sample offline, giving computers (and training in their use) to those who had none. The participants were provided with carefully balanced briefing materials, then met online in randomly assigned small groups to engage in weekly voice-based discussions led by trained moderators.

We contrast this treatment group with a pre-post control group who did not deliberate. This data will allow us to compare the roles of candidate traits, information (including ""misinformation"" or its absence) and policy positions both of voters and candidates in the treatment and control groups-- in determining key attitudes and voting intentions."

Results indicated that demands by either parents or adolescents were associated positively with the other dyad members withdrawal. Overall, parent-demand/adolescent-withdraw was more prevalent than was adolescent-demand/parent-withdraw; however, parent-demand/adolescent-withdraw was significantly lower during discussions of adolescents issues than during discussions of parents issues. There were few differences based on the sex of the parent or the child, but parent-demand/adolescent-withdraw during discussion of parents issues was higher in dyads with mothers than in dyad with fathers. The discussion focuses on the implications for understanding demand/withdraw communication and on the utility of examining demand/withdraw in parent-adolescent relationships."

This paper provides more rigorous empirical support for theoretical propositions detailed in an earlier paper based on qualitative data (Yee, 2004). The findings show that not only do MMORPGs appeal to a wide age range (Mage= 26.57, range = 11-68), but also that the appeal is strong (on average 22 hours of usage per week). Also, survey data indicated that users derive meaningful relationships and salient emotional experiences from these virtual environments."
2005-1509,The Desirability Paradox in the Effects of Media Literacy Training,king Cessation and Tobacco Decision-Making,Health Communication,,,Paper,The Desirability Paradox in the Effects of Media Literacy Training,Smoking Cessation and Tobacco Decision-Making,"This study examined a paradox in findings regarding the effects of media literacy training on decision making about tobacco. Recent experiments found that training reduced many beliefs predictive of risky behavior, but levels of affect, operationalized as desirability of individuals portrayed, increased. This study confirmed the hypothesis that media literacy training changes individuals ideas about desirability. Although desirability usually represents individuals affect toward portrayals, reports gathered after media literacy training also appear to reflect increased awareness of efforts made by message producers to manufacture attractive portrayals. This awareness reduces or eliminates the effect that positive affect otherwise would have on decision making. Because the results suggest that individuals may respond to survey questions differently depending on their level of skill or involvement, the results raise important issues regarding issues of reliability and validity that may extend far beyond tests of this theoretical model or this particular evaluation."

Despite the lack of government protection and support, it was rarely dominated by Hollywood features. The question of my paper is, “How did the early year (pre-1990s) of Hong Kong and Hong Kong cinema enable Hong Kong cinema to flourish in the 1990s?” It is a study of the history of Hong Kong and its cinema. I will examine the political, economic and social formation of Hong Kong which has facilitated Hong Kong cinema to be competitive in the world market. Hong Kong cinema, strangely, in its regional and global context, benefited from the world's asymmetrical power structure. It was enabled by Hong Kong’s political detachment, economic autonomy and social network. However, the same factors also made it vulnerable to volatile international changes and impeded its growth."

Second, after a brief overview of the dialectics and systems theories, I present and critique the model of dialectics and leadership presented by Kevin Barge in Communication and Decisions in Groups (1996). Third, I present my dialectical theory of leadership (DTL) which is a marriage of dialectics and systems. I advance several propositions at that time. In addition, I map out directions in advancing and elaborating the DTL in the future: typology of dialectics, time-dialectics models, proposal for future testing, and deeper embedding into the systems perspective. Next, I follow with the evaluation of the theory. Finally, I finish with a summary that seeks to close the gap between theory and practice. This final pericope seeks to present the findings in an accessible manner that can be easily embraced by practitioners."

However, the taste and style associated with the white wedding are incongruous with the everyday existence of many couples. Drawing upon Bordieus ideas on taste and the habitus and Virgina Postrels insights from The Substance of Style on the role of style in the establishment and display of taste, class, and identity, this paper argues that the American wedding requires couples to move beyond their habitus to display the expected level of taste.

Because television provides much essential information about the expectations for a white wedding, this paper focuses on depictions of weddings in three reality television shows: A Wedding Story, For Better or For Worse, and My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancé. Although the goals and styles of the shows vary, each show raises similar questions about taste, class, and style in relation to the American wedding."

The ecology of games provides a detailed and dynamic structure about communication policy issues by identifying games and players involved in a specific communication policy process. Due to its methodological abstractness of the ecology of games, however, studies adopting this frame work have been extremely rare. In order to overcome this limitation, this study introduces a more systematic way to apply the ecology of games in communication policy studiesthe content analysis of newspaper reporting on communication policy issues. With the case study of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, the study found that five different games were involved: politics/morality game, freedom of arts game, lobby game, constitution game, and new law game by nine players."

In order to examine the roles of narrative engagement and identification with the characters of an E-E program, this study proposed and tested a recursive structural equation model with specific hypotheses. Survey data drawn from listeners of a radio serial drama for HIV/AIDS prevention in Ethiopia were analyzed for the study.
In a proposed model, this study found that an audience members identification with a character played a mediating role in the relationships between narrative engagement and individuals beliefs about HIV/AIDS although this mediating role was partially supported. In addition, the direct effects of both affective engagement and cognitive engagement on individuals health beliefs were found. Based on the findings, Theoretical and practical implications were discussed."

First, the study quantitatively analyzes the influence of organizational and communication campaign design variables on the success of the AIDS preventive communication campaigns in Uganda. The second purpose is to fininsh building a quantitative model of relationships between the organizational factors and campaigns design elements developed by Kiwanuka-Tondo & Snyder (2002), by adding reach as a variable to the model. The study uses reach to measure the success of the AIDS preventive communication campaigns in Uganda.The research study addresses two major research questions. First, what organizational variables and communication campaign design elements led to the success of the Uganda AIDS campaigns? Second, what works and what does not work among the organizational factors; campaigns design elements, and campaign success variables? The study used a probability sample of 180 organizations. The results show that financial resources, multiple channels, targeting and participation of outreach workers were directly linked to reach, hence success. The study also shows that while research is emphasized by other scholars a vital campaign design element it is necessary for the campaign process but does not gaurantee success. On the other hand participation of outreach workers in vital campaign design element sicne it directly leads to success. This was the first systematic, empirical and quantitative study to test a model of the relationships between organizational, communication campaign design, and campaign success variables. The study has practical and theoretical implications for funding agencies, health campaign designer, and communication campaign researchers."

These primary caregivers can be defined as the facilitators of the needs of homebound patients. These patients and caregivers obtain the majority of their socialization and communication through one another, which in turn, can affect a caregiver and a homebound patients quality of life and communication. Since many disparities exist between the views and needs of the caregiver and the homebound patient, primary caregivers may experience misunderstandings, which can lead to decreased psychological and physical well-being for both the patient and caregiver, thus, affecting both quality of life and communication competence scores. This descriptive study examines how communication competence mitigates a caregivers quality of life scores by using Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index (QLI). Also, face-to-face communication competence index scores across variables are compared to levels of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) usage.

A convenience sample of 112 primary caregivers with Internet access completed a questionnaire, including a QLI and a communication competence index. Computation of two-tailed t tests revealed that statistical significance existed between high and low users of CMC, quality of life and communication competence scores."

At least two mechanisms are possible: (a) disruptions may interfere with memory by creating distractions and divided attention during encoding or (b) disruptions may degrade the flow of interaction which requires that participants engage in conversation repair rather than the task at hand. This study examined both alternatives in a group of parents (N = 40) whose infant had received a newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF). Upon arrival at the hospital, parent completed a questionnaire designed to assess their knowledge of CF. Their interaction with the genetic counselor was videotaped and coded for the presence of disruptions. Six weeks after the counseling parents again completed the knowledge measure. The data showed a direct negative effect for disruptions on memory for CF-related risk information at time two. Disruptions also produced the anticipated effect on conversation, but counter to expectations, interruptions of conversation flow was positively associated with knowledge at time two."

A brochure promoting the use of CT was mailed to 375 junior and senior high schools in Colorado. Schools were assigned to condition by region served by the local tobacco control coalition. Schools in half of the regions received a cover letter from the director of the coalition, endorsing the program. Also, schools in half of the regions received a set of testimonials from teachers who had used CT. Visits to the CT website by teachers and students at each school were recorded. Teachers at 228 schools completed a posttest survey by telephone. A greater percentage of schools receiving the opinion leader letter had a teacher or student visit the CT website (14%) than schools not receiving the letter (7%, p=.037). However, more teachers at schools receiving the testimonials appeared to read the promotional materials (29%) than at schools not receiving them (20%; p=.059). The lack of both testimonials and opinion leader letters produced very low readership (13%; p=.083). Testimonials also created more intentions to use CT (49% with testimonial; 35% without testimonials, p=.047). Testimonials may be effective at increasing teachers exposure to the promotional materials but recommendations from opinion leaders appear to convince teachers to actually use a smoking prevention program. The findings are consistent with the diffusion of innovations model."

The purpose of this study was to test the potential situational and cultural factors that influence individuals apologetic intentions in conflict situations. The research examines how offender responsibility, offense severity, and prior relationship between offender and victim influence individuals decisions to apologize when they offend others. Moreover, the study investigated the salience of autonomy and image face concerns for self and others and the role of these face concerns in determining individuals apologetic intentions when an offense occurs. The major findings of the current study are as follows: (a) no difference was found in self and other face concerns and apologetic intentions between two cultural groups: Americans and Chinese; (b) responsibility was positively associated with self and other face concerns and apology; (c) severity was positively associated with self face concerns; (d) relationship was negatively associated with self face concerns and positively associated with other face concerns; (e) other face concern was associated positively with apology; and (f) culture moderated the effect of responsibility on apology."

Pregnancy has been identified as a time of crisis for many couples and little research has explored the role of communication during this life-changing event. The WEHIS, Womens Experience of Heterosexual Intercourse Scale, developed by Birnbaum et al. (2001) was adapted and used to assess sexual communication and its effects on relationship satisfaction. In the present study pregnant women and, in some cases, their partners completed a questionnaire. The initial research question explored the relationship between talk about sex and sexual frequency. Results of this study concluded that couples who talk (versus do not talk) about sex actually engage in sex more frequently. The study also hypothesized that couples who talk about sex during pregnancy experience more pleasure during sex. It was concluded that talking about sex does not have a direct effect on the pleasure an individual experiences during sex. Finally, as predicted, couples who experience more pleasure during sex throughout pregnancy report being more satisfied with their relationship."
2005-1522,The Effect of Violated Expectation on Message Processing Modes,cial Influence and Persuasion: A High Density Panel,Information Systems,,,Paper,The Effect of Violated Expectation on Message Processing Modes,Social Influence and Persuasion: A High Density Panel,"Two experiments examined the issue of whether violated expectation would instigate systematic processing of a message regarded as relevant among subjects. In Experiment 1, subjects were assigned to a 2 (argument quality: strong versus weak) × 2 (message status: majority versus minority) factorial design and were exposed to a counter-attitudinal message that argued for negative personal interests for them. The result of Experiment 1 indicated that systematic processing occurred for a majority source, but not for a minority source. However, it was not clear whether violated expectation resulting from a majority-supported counter-attitudinal message or defensive processing motivated to protect personal interests invoked systematic processing of a majority source because the persuasive message was not only against subjects' attitudes but also against their personal interests. Therefore, in Experiment 2, subjects were exposed to a message only against their attitudes but not against their personal interests. Subjects involved in systematic processing of both a majority source and a minority source. The comparison of the results from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 revealed that violated expectation was a motivational factor that instigated systematic processing of a majority source."

The intervention, which was guided largely by the Extended Parallel Process Model (Witte, 1992) and the Reducing the Risk (Barth, 1996) curriculum, was implemented and evaluated in nine rural high schools using an institutional cycle pretest-posttest control-group design (Campbell & Stanley, 1963; Cook & Campbell, 1979). Nine hundred and sixty-four students completed the survey at both points in time. Results indicated that over 91% of students in the treatment group completed at least one of the six computer based activities (M = 3.46, SD = 1.44 for those doing at least one activity). Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that students in the treatment group outperformed students in the control group on knowledge, condom self-efficacy, attitude toward waiting to have sex, and perceived susceptibility of HIV. These results suggest that computer-based programs may be a cost-effective and easily replicable means of providing teens with basic information and skills necessary to prevent pregnancy, STDs, and HIV."
2005-1524,The Effects of Ad Variation on the Web,Understanding Internet Advertisement,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Effects of Ad Variation on the Web,Understanding Internet Advertisement,An experiment was conducted to examine the interactions between ad variation and brand familiarity on brand memory and attitudes under low frequency conditions in the Web advertising environment. Results (N = 130) show that ad variation and brand familiarity interact on brand memory but no interaction effects were found on attitudes. Theoretical implications of the results are discussed in terms of differential attention and encoding variability.
2005-1525,The Effects of College Alcohol Campaigns and College Students Intention to Consume Alcoholic Beverage,Alcohol Abuse Prevention,Health Communication,,,Paper,The Effects of College Alcohol Campaigns and College Students Intention to Consume Alcoholic Beverage,Alcohol Abuse Prevention,"Following the rational of the social norm approach to college students drinking behavior, which states that students overestimate their fellow students support of permissive drinking behaviors, and that this overestimation correlate with college students own drinking behaviors, colleges confidently applied the methods to reduce campus alcohol consumption. The integrated health model was used as a framework for this research to evaluate effectiveness of the college alcohol campaign at a southeast research university. The 132 participants were randomly sampled from an undergraduate registration list and an online survey was employed.
Intention to drink alcohol was negatively associated with attitude toward the harmful effects of alcohol, but positively associated with perceived approval from significant others. Students who perceived the ability to exercise control over motivation are less likely to drink excessively in the near future. Consistent with the pluralistic ignorance assumption, students believed that other students are more comfortable than they are with alcohol consumption on campus. However, the social norms campaign had minimal impact on students estimation of friends drinking behaviors and showed no significant relationship with self-reported intention to consume alcohol."

This study will experimentally test the effects of complexity of choice by having subjects look at pictures chosen from either a limited or an extensive array of options. Cognitive processing will be operationalized through the use of heart rate as an indicator of automatic attention and recognition memory as an indicator of encoding. Emotional processing will be operationalized through the use of facial EMG as a physiological indicator of valence, skin conductance as a physiological indicator of autonomic arousal, and SAM as an indicator of subjective valence and arousal."

However, many aspects of both content and persons considered may moderate this effect. This experiment manipulated abstraction of both content and third persons, measuring effects of violent video games and attitudes toward censoring violent games. Participants estimated the effects of either violent video games in general or a specific violent game on themselves and either a specific third person, others on their university campus, or others in the United States. Increasing specificity of both content and third person was found to reduce perceived effects on others, although the manipulations did not significantly affect advocacy of censorship."

Participants were given shared and unshared information about the issue to read before meeting in the group. In half the groups, the confederate only discussed shared information (shared condition), and in the other groups, the confederate only discussed unshared information the two participants had not received before the group discussion (unshared condition). There were no effects of mutual enhancement. Participants did not rate the confederate or themselves as more knowledgeable or competent when the confederate only mentioned shared information. Participants did not rate shared information as significantly more valid, important, or familiar in the shared condition than unshared condition. However, participants preference for their own unshared information compared to the confederates unshared information and the bias for shared information over unshared information was reduced in the unshared condition."

2005-1530,The Effects of Knowledge and Empathy in a Theoretically-Based Intervention Campaign Targeting Depression,Communication to Overcome Stigma,Health Communication,,,Paper,The Effects of Knowledge and Empathy in a Theoretically-Based Intervention Campaign Targeting Depression,Communication to Overcome Stigma,"Mental health and, more specifically, depression are areas of growing concern to health professionals and the public alike. Effective communication campaigns can be used to increase the number of people receiving treatment for depressive disorders. The purposes of this study are: (a) to explore communication campaigns combining mass and interpersonal communication, (b) to investigate the effectiveness of the extended parallel process model and risk perception attitude framework for an intervention-based depression campaign, and (c) to assess how knowledge and empathy may influence intervention behaviors. Results indicate that the EPPM and RPA framework provide valuable theoretical guidance for an intervention campaign targeting depression in college students. In addition, knowledge and empathy play a significant role in this depression intervention situation."

All participants (N = 56) in a 2 (mood) x 2 (color condition) between-participants experiment were randomly assigned to one of the two experimentally manipulated mood conditions (either the positive or the neutral state) and watched a negative television political advertisement. After exposure, participants were asked to evaluate on a questionnaire their attitudes toward the message and the candidate. They were also tested for their memory of the message. The results indicated that the participants prevailing mood states significantly influenced their perceptions of the candidate as well as their memory of the message. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
2005-1532,The Effects of Priming Self-Objectification on College Women's Encoding of Television Advertisements,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,The Effects of Priming Self-Objectification on College Women's Encoding of Television Advertisements,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,"Objectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) suggests that girls and women are acculturated to internalize a viewers perspective as a primary view of their physical selves. This tendency is called self-objectification, and it can take on both the properties of a trait-like and state-like construct. Research on objectification theory has either examined the consequences of self-objectification on emotional health or has examined media exposure as an antecedent to self-objectification. The focus of the current proposed study is to answer the opposite question: Does priming self-objectification affect what women encode from the media? To answer this question, an experimental study is proposed in which college women will be primed with self-objectification words or neutral words. After the priming task, all participants will be asked to view advertisements that contain a high level of sexual objectification of womens bodies. Later, participants will be asked to report whether randomly selected two-second clips came from the ads they saw earlier. The main hypothesis is that participants given a self-objectification prime will have higher recognition for sexually objectifying television ads than participants primed with non-body related words."

Moreover, individuals moral development level is argued to be a moderator. The study surveyed 94 participants with Rests (1986) DIT and a distortion scenario. Consistent with the predictions, the effect of promotion aspirations was moderated by individuals level of moral development. Specifically, when promotion aspirations were low no difference in distortion was found between low (M=2.25, SD=.76) and high (M =2.0, SD=.92) moral development participants. However, when promotion aspirations were high, low moral development participants (M=2.80, SD=1.32) distorted more than high (M=1.58, SD=.71) moral development people. The limitations and further research directions are discussed."
2005-1534,The Effects of Sex on Television Drama Shows on Emerging Adults' Sexual Attitudes and Moral Judgments,"Media, Sex, & Society",Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Effects of Sex on Television Drama Shows on Emerging Adults' Sexual Attitudes and Moral Judgments,"Media, Sex, & Society","This experimental study tests the effects of exposure to sexual television content on emerging adults sexual attitudes and moral judgments. Two hundred and six undergraduate students are randomly assigned to one of three conditions manipulating consequence contingencies portrayed in shows: positive, negative, and neutral consequences of sexual intercourse, and to a control condition. Results indicate that exposure to shows that portray negative consequences of sex leads to more negative attitudes toward sex and to more negative moral judgments of characters engaged in this behavior. Outcome expectancies about premarital sex do not seem to play a role in moderating the effects of exposure to different consequence portrayals. The study sheds light on the developmental period of emerging adulthood. It extends the application of social cognitive theory to the realm of media sex while highlighting some deviations from theoretical predictions about the role of outcome expectancies in mediating effects."

Results indicate that the presence of slow motion does not affect the orienting responses. It was also reported that it takes time for slow motion to increase cognitive efforts in viewers, slow motion affects the experience of negative emotions rather than positive emotions, and slow motion has little, if any, affect on arousal response in viewers. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed."
2005-1536,The Effects of User Control on the Cognitive and Emotional Processing of Pictures,Theoretical Issues in the Study of Interactivity,Information Systems,,,Paper,The Effects of User Control on the Cognitive and Emotional Processing of Pictures,Theoretical Issues in the Study of Interactivity,"This paper explores psychology related to the moment that control is exercised during interactions with media. What is the difference, in the thoughtful and emotional engagement of viewers with the content presented, between reacting to media versus controlling its onset? Subjects viewed pictures on a computer as part of a 2 (Control) x 2 (Picture Type) x 16 (Repetitions) within-subjects experiment (N=22). In one condition, subjects controlled picture onset with a computer mouse. In the other condition, the computer controlled picture onset. Heart rate and skin conductance were collected as indicators of automatic attention and arousal elicited by each manipulation of Control. Results showed that subjects exhibited a cardiac response indicative of an active, stimulus-rejection posture, when they had control over picture onset. Subjects exhibited a cardiac response indicative of an attentive, stimulus-intake posture, when the computer controlled picture onset. Physiological arousal was higher when subjects had control over picture onset. Subjects gave higher valence and arousal ratings for pictures that were presented by the computer. These results are discussed in relation to current assumptions of interactive media and audience activity."
2005-1551,The Emotional Life of the News: a Mediational Perspective on News Consumption and its Relevance for Political Communication,formation Processing: How We Come to Understand the World Around Us,Political Communication,,,Paper,The Emotional Life of the News: a Mediational Perspective on News Consumption and its Relevance for Political Communication,Information Processing: How We Come to Understand the World Around Us,"This paper examines a somewhat neglected  yet central  aspect of news consumption, that of emotions. Although the news is one of the most studied television genres, most traditional approaches rarely depart significantly from an  often unwitting  normative view (Schudson, 2000: 194). The paper is based on the premise that audiences engagement (or disengagement) with the news and politics involves both rational and affective elements. Drawing on original ethnographic work with British audiences the paper explores the emotional dimension of news consumption and discusses how it is relevant in the wider processes of engagement and participation in public life. The paper explores feelings and themes such as addiction, reassurance, shame, anxiety, pride, ambivalence, disappointment and anger and observes how audiences, through the news, connect (or not) to the wider narratives that have become the fabric of our world. The paper points to the power of the news and how much it is taken for granted even by those who are critical towards its content. Crucially, the paper has argued that the affective dimension of news consumption can cast light on the wider process of citizens engagement with politics and public life. News as a narrative is the means through which people connect to the world. But also, for some informants news has been a source of disappointment and anger and a catalyst for withdrawal from public life."
2005-1552,The Ethical Foundation of PR: An Analysis of Public Relations Firms Codes of Ethics,tudent Session - High Density Paper Presentation,Public Relations,,,Paper,The Ethical Foundation of PR: An Analysis of Public Relations Firms Codes of Ethics,Student Session - High Density Paper Presentation,"The purpose of this paper is to identify common moral values of public relations practitioners through content analyzing the codes of ethics of twelve public relations firms. Unlike previous studies that have focused on personal values of public relations professionals, this study focuses on organizational values of public relations firms and is based on the theoretical foundation of expectancy-value theory. The study explores the possibility that since practitioners are likely to be held accountable for organizational values more so than personal values, these organizational values may be better indicators of the ethical norms of the public relations field. Also, by analyzing public relations firms codes of ethics rather than professional societies codes of ethics (such as the Public Relations Society of America), this paper focuses on codes that are legally enforceable and, thus, perhaps better indicators of the ethical foundation of public relations."
2005-1553,The Ethos of TV Relationships. Why Popular Drama Series Persistently Worry Television Scholars.,The One and the Other One: Dramatic Encounters in Popular Communication,Popular Communication,,,Paper,The Ethos of TV Relationships. Why Popular Drama Series Persistently Worry Television Scholars.,The One and the Other One: Dramatic Encounters in Popular Communication,"In many popular television series such as Sex and the City, Will and Grace, Cold Feet, and Friends, singles or non-traditional relationship forms are center-stage. Time and again critics have wondered whether the decrease in nuclear families and the increasing representation of liberated, independent women in popular television series is responsible for the rise of the number of divorces and the number of singles in the real world. Almost all American research into the impact of the representation of TV-relationships takes this moral panic as a starting point. Intriguingly, not one single researcher finally concludes that television offers a bad example. In this paper we will explain why and how the moral panic about the impact of television on peoples relationships tends to recur. Is this kind of panic typically American? To what extent might a similar content-analysis of internationally produced television occasion the same kind of paradox? The relationship practices represented on television explain to some extent the temptation of so many researchers to investigate them. But these relationship images do not follow naturally from the relationship discourses on television and vice versa. While most television studies tend to neglect the role of TV as medium we will show the particular demands it poses on drama and sitcom. We argue that television does not so much mirror any historical or social changes, except for changes in the conventions of the medium itself, and that it largely adheres to its own logic when it comes to presenting relationship practices."
2005-1554,The Existential Fiduciary: A Normative Emphasis for Journalists in a New Media Environment,"Trust, Responsibility and the Unaccepted: Issues of Ethics and Credibility in Journalism",Journalism Studies,,,Paper,The Existential Fiduciary: A Normative Emphasis for Journalists in a New Media Environment,"Trust, Responsibility and the Unaccepted: Issues of Ethics and Credibility in Journalism","In an open and virtually boundless media environment, old responses to the question of who is a journalist, based primarily on roles associated with the process of gathering and disseminating information, no longer apply. This paper argues for a reconceptualization of the journalist based instead on normative definitions. Specifically, it examines a blend of two competing philosophical approaches, existentialism and social responsibility theory, as well as two roughly corresponding norms within the profession, independence and accountability. The combination yields a definition of an existential fiduciary journalist who chooses to act as a trustworthy source of information that serves the public interest. The paper applies that framework at both a concrete level, through consideration of blogs and of the proliferation of partisan information sources, and a conceptual level, through consideration of gatekeeping and agenda-setting functions."

Korea/ Japan, in U.S. Newspapers",National Image Building Through News Coverage,"This study examined whether hosting the World Cup sporting event influences national image, deviance, and prominence in news covering the 1998 World Cup and the 2002 World Cup event and its host countries in leading US newspapers. In particular, by comparing news of World Cup related host country news with other news unrelated the World Cup, this study examined possible differences in variables, based on understanding national relations between the United States and host countries. At first, this study shows that though the 2002 World Cup event was hosted by two countries, Korea and Japan, US newspapers covered more news of the 1998 World Cup hosted by France. Second, the result reveals that political, economic, and cultural links with the United State are reflected in covering news of the World Cup and its host country. The result concluded that hosting the World Cup does not warrant favorable national image, less deviant news coverage, and high prominence in US newspapers unlike host countrys expectations."

2005-1557,The Formation of 1970s Korean Youth Culture: Focusing on the Cultural Consumption of Popular Music,(Trans)forming Cultural Values in Popular Music,Popular Communication,,,Paper,The Formation of 1970s Korean Youth Culture: Focusing on the Cultural Consumption of Popular Music,(Trans)forming Cultural Values in Popular Music,"1970s Korean Youth Culture is historically significant in two aspects. First, it was the first concrete form of Korean popular culture to be distinguished in terms of age and its audience. Second, it was the first site in the history of Korean culture that a state of tension was generated between a dominant group of the cultural hegemony and its subordinate counterpart. However, academic and social consideration toward this culture has been limited. Therefore, with the goal of restoring Youth Cultures historical significance, this study attempts to map out the external historical context and internal procedures that formed and sustained the Culture. Through historical research, personal interviews, and questionnaires, the interactions among various historical conditions, the youths identity and sensibilities, and cultural forms specifically related to popular music were explored. Interpretation of the material showed that 1970s Youth Culture was a complex, dynamic, and meaningful formation."
2005-1558,The Fundamental Attribution Error in Attributing Fictional Figures' Characteristics to the Actors,Dimensions of Fame & Celebrity,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Fundamental Attribution Error in Attributing Fictional Figures' Characteristics to the Actors,Dimensions of Fame & Celebrity,"Two studies attempted to document the occurrence of the psychological phenomenon known as the fundamental attribution error (FAE) in the audiovisual medium. The FAE refers to the human tendency to attribute people's behavior to internal attributes more than external factors. In Study 1, we demonstrated that in the audiovisual medium, viewers tend to attribute an actors behavior in television dramas to the actors personality, ignoring the existence of a script dictating the actors behavior. Study 2 replicated this finding, and also demonstrated that the tendency to make the FAE is related to the degree to which the person reports being transported into the narrative of the TV drama. Furthermore, we showed that the tendency to attribute character traits to the actor is not diminished following exposure to the same actor playing two opposing roles. The last scene viewed was found to determine the evaluation of the actors characteristics."

This paper begins with an investigation of the successful creation of the Girls Gone Wild brand, by looking more specifically at the ways in which its creator utilized the current media landscape and effectively marketed his product. Next, the paper turns to an ideological analysis in order to further understand just how the series is able to reproduce itself through the docile, voluntary labor of young women. In order to do so, I will examine the acceptance and normalization of risqué behavior in the carnivalesque, feeding into Debords (1995) society of the spectacle. Further, I argue that the desire to be featured on camera and the promise of possibly being featured in a reality-based program holds cultural clout with younger generations, thanks to an overall media climate that emphasizes interactivity and self-disclosure. Finally, I conclude my analysis with a discussion of the ways in which the ideology of ""Girls Gone Wild"" aligns popular notions of both post- and third-wave feminism, movements that place an emphasis on sexuality and individualism as means of female empowerment. Through these explorations, this project reveals the complexities of popular culture that contribute to the frustrating ideological problem as to how the women of ""Girls Gone Wild"" can seemingly know what they are doing, but do it anyway.

This study analyzed actual search terms and keywords entered by users of the Internets leading search engine Google in August September and October 2001. In subsequent analyses, Web search patterns were compared with the news coverage and information provided by the television and print media in the same period.
The study examined the impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on uses and gratifications of Web searchers to conclude that while the Web is an important source of entertainment in the days after 9/11 it gratified users needs to find information and news (surveillance)."

The study used a (2) Appeal Type (social/fear) X (2) Camera Changes (slow/fast) X (3) Information Introduced (low/medium/high) design. Sixty-one participants made Third Person (3P) (self less affected than others) and 56 participants made First Person (1P) judgments (self more affected than others). For both groups, perceived differences between effects significantly increased as the social distance of the other increased. Greater differences were found between the 1P and 3P groups ratings for effects on self than between their ratings for others. Valence, arousal, and self-relevance increased perceived effects of PSAs on self, although these functioned differently for social and fear appeals. Perceived effects on self and others and arousal were greater for fear appeals than for social appeals. Message recognition, however, was better for social appeals. In addition to appeal type, structural features of the PSAsmessage pacing and complexityinfluenced judgments. For slower paced messages, increasing message complexity (II) increased perceived effects on self and others, arousal, and recognition. Participants reported greater effects on self and others, arousal, and recognition for less complex fast-paced messages than for slower messages. However, as message complexity increased, ratings for these variables decreased. Implications for 3P and 1P judgments and suggestions for health campaign PSA message design are discussed."
2005-1563,The Impact of a Training Program on the Self-Efficacy of Volunteer Rape Crisis Counselors,Provider-Client Communication I: Provider Issues,Health Communication,,,Paper,The Impact of a Training Program on the Self-Efficacy of Volunteer Rape Crisis Counselors,Provider-Client Communication I: Provider Issues,"The aim of this research is to examine the impact of a training program on the self-efficacy of volunteer counselors at a rape crisis center. Self-efficacy is the central component of the social cognitive model of counselor training, and is mediated by several motivational, affective, and cognitive processes (Larson, 1998). This study also looks at the relationship between counseling self-efficacy and communication competence and communication anxiety. The sample consists of three cohorts of volunteers trained at a rape crisis center over one year (N = 50). Pretest surveys were administered both before and after the crisis center training. Results indicate (1) that the training increased of counseling self-efficacy over time, (2) there was a negative relationship between counseling self-efficacy and communication anxiety, and (3) there was a positive relationship between counseling self-efficacy and communication competence. These results have implications for how the counseling self-efficacy literature can be extended to non-professional counselors, how interpersonal communication variables affect self-efficacy, and how the training program at the crisis center can be modified to better address counselor needs."
2005-1564,The Impact of Disposition and Motive on Acceptance for Violence: Evidence for Social Comparison Processes?,Mass Communication Top Faculty Papers,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Impact of Disposition and Motive on Acceptance for Violence: Evidence for Social Comparison Processes?,Mass Communication Top Faculty Papers,"Experimental studies demonstrate that justified media violence facilitates resultant aggression (Berkowitz & Geen, 1967; Berkowitz & Powers, 1979; Meyer, 1972), while exposure to unjust aggression may reduce these tendencies (Geen, 1981). However, ambiguity remains concerning the features delineating justified from unjustified violence and the psychological processes leading to subsequent aggressive behavior. Lachlan and Tamborini (2004) found that incongruous portrayals of violence, especially those committed by liked characters with unsanctioned motives, may be especially problematic in leading to short term acceptance of violence. The current study exposed participants to a film clip of such an incongruous portrayal, and then asked subjects to evaluate the use of violence in a subsequent social situation, manipulating disposition and motive for the characters in the subsequent observation while keeping the features of the film stimulus constant. Initial findings on both the ideal response and the range of acceptable behaviors suggest cognitive comparison processes between the film stimulus and subsequent attitudes concerning the use of aggression. Violence may be met with greater approval when featuring more delineating justification characteristics than a previously seen film clip. Implications of these findings and directions for further research are discussed."

Based on Banduras theory of self-regulation (1991) and Csikszentimihalys theory of flow experience (1975), this study proposed an integrative model of video game consumption behavior and investigated how flow experiences affect self-regulatory mechanism of media behavior involving self-reactive outcome expectations, deficient self-regulation, and habitual media behavior. As expected, this study found significant impacts of flow experience on video game self-reactive outcome expectations, deficient self-regulation, and habitual consumption behavior among 411 college undergraduate students. However, there was no direct relationship between flow experience and the amount of time spent on playing video games. Combined, these variables explained 54 percent of the variance in video game use."

Three distinct considerations, unscriptedness, actuality, and candidness, seemed to contribute to perceptions of factuality. Unscriptedness was associated with feelings of suspense, whereas candidness was associated with perceptions of learning. Contrasts in the findings as compared to previous work are discussed in terms of critical and referential readings."

Emotional intelligence refers to individuals ability to regulate their feelings in social contexts. EQ plays an important role in effective interpersonal communication. The study employed social cognitive theory as the theoretical framework which suggests that human behavior is developed as a result of an interaction of social, cognitive and behavioral factors. The results suggest that the social cognitive framework is critical to help predict and analyze young adults emotional intelligence competencies .
Another significant finding is that the study develops a reliable emotional intelligence competency scale which measures both intrapersonal and interpersonal communication. Some limitations, implications, suggestions for future research are provided."

Specifically, the colloquial form of Singapore English, known as Singlish, was manipulated together with information about the expertise of a discussant in a 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial design, with the discussion issue manipulated as a within-subjects variable. 80 undergraduates, 42 male and 38 female, participated in the study. Generally, the results of this study provide very limited support for the significant effects of status cues on perceptions and participation. The implications of the results of this study for theories in computer-mediated communication and linguistics, in the specific context of the Internet, are discussed."

This study proposed three hypotheses and implemented an experiment to test the hypothesized relationships. All the relevant definitions were conceptualized based on a literature review. The studys respondents were divided into the categories of friendly public and hostile public, based on the results of the organization-public relationship measurement. This study verifies the hypothesis that there are differences between the two groups perceptions toward a same crisis situation and image restoration strategies. The canonical correlation analysis also supports the hypothesis that the publics perceptions of the crisis substantially affect the attitude toward image restoration strategies practiced by the organization."

We hypothesize that the presence of anthropomorphic agents will have an impact on viewers emotional responses and perceived credibility of the website, which further influence attitudes toward the website. Through an experiment, we found that the presence of anthropomorphic agents had a significant impact on attitudes toward the website and that this impact was mediated by viewers emotional responses, but not the perceived credibility of the website. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed."

News coverage from the United States, Thailand, and South Africa was evaluated for the following HIV/AIDS-specific message frames: carriers, transmitters, sources, at risk, prevention methods, consequences, and attempts to combat. Hypotheses were articulated with reference to Hofstedes (2003) cultural dimensions of power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation. Uncertainty avoidance played the strongest role in predicting news frame prevalence, while long-term orientation played no role at all. The other three cultural dimensions had limited influence."

Numerous studies have investigated the effect of different types of evidence, but the influence of the cultural background of receivers of persuasive messages has been neglected. An experiment was set up to investigate the cultural influence on the relative persuasiveness of statistical, anecdotal, causal, and expert evidence. Dutch and French participants (n = 600) had to judge the probability of claims supported by evidence. The results showed cross-cultural differences. Whereas anecdotal evidence proved more convincing for the French compared to the Dutch, the reverse pattern was observed for statistical evidence. Next, there appeared a strong cultural difference in the way expert evidence is valued in both cultures. The persuasiveness of expert evidence seemed to be of normative concern for the French participants, and of personal concern for the Dutch."
2005-1573,The Influence of Editorial Framing on Reader Attitudes toward Affirmative Action and,Media Influences on Public Opinion,Political Communication,,,Paper,The Influence of Editorial Framing on Reader Attitudes toward Affirmative Action and,Media Influences on Public Opinion,"An experiment investigated the impact of editorial framing on readers political cognitions and affect toward a different racial group. Participants read mock newspaper editorials endorsing Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), a U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding affirmative action in higher education. The editorials were systematically manipulated to present different frame(s) in four randomly assigned versions: remedial action, diversity, combined (both frames) and control (neither frame). Frame inductions did not significantly influence support for affirmative action. However, exposure to editorials presenting the diversity frame moderated the relation between whites pre-tested interracial attitudes (modern racism, white guilt and belief in white privilege) and support for affirmative action. Editorials presenting the diversity frame also induced white participants to score higher on a measure of pro-black affect. Overall, the results suggest that frames can activate distinct social identities within the minds of readers, priming their applicability to the task at hand."

A sample of 138 matched dyads of undergraduates and one of their parents completed two instruments (a) Love Attitudes Scale (Hendrick & Hendrick, 1990) and (b) Revised Family Communication Patterns Inventory (Ritchie & Fitzpatrick, 1990) plus three open-ended questions. Interesting, but complicated, relationships between parents’ and young adults’ love attitudes were found. Various dimensions of fathers’ love attitudes in some way predicted four of their young adult children’s love attitudes: Eros, Ludus, Mania, and Agape. Examination of family communication and love attitudes also revealed complex relationships. Family communication patterns of conversation and conformity predicted young adults’ love attitudes of Eros, Ludus, Pragma, and Mania in various ways. Finally, the free-will responses served as confirmation and further clarification of the complex relationships between family communication and young adults’ love attitudes."

In a mixed 2 (self-efficacy) X 2 (search task specificity) repeated-measures experimental design, participants conducted two search tasks (general and specific) that varied in the amount of task effort required. When search task specificity was taken into account, there was an Internet self-efficacy and task specificity interaction where high Internet self-efficacy participants locates sites higher in Web site accountability in the general search task (the more complex search task) than their low self-efficacy counterparts. There was no significant difference in credibility perceptions for the specific search task (the less complex task). High Internet self-efficacy participants demonstrated better online performance than their low Internet self-efficacy counterparts."

By means of structural equation modeling, it was determined that information seeking in the form of active use of parenting magazines is motivated by nontraditional mother concerns, as opposed to concerns associated with all mothers (traditional and nontraditional) and also by type of mother identity. Mothers espousing a traditional mother identity spent less time reading parenting magazines and did not make active use of parenting magazines."

We test this idea on a sample of Jewish Settlers in the Gaza Strip (N =413), in the dramatic context of a Likud party vote on Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharons plan to pull out from the Gaza Strip, including a proposed evacuation of the settlers from their homes. Findings show that perceptions of media influence of biased media coverage of the settlements on Israeli public opinion will be associated with perceptions of negative image of the settlements in the Israeli public opinion which in turn impact justification of violent resistance for the likely evacuation. Perceived image of the settlements, resulting from presumed media influence, affects settlers political inefficacy, and their thoughts about residential mobility."

Across the globe, policy makers and law enforcement agencies have responded by constructing an elaborate global prohibition regime that seeks to curtail money-laundering activities. This regime includes an unprecedented transnational state surveillance capacity. According to the loss-of-control perspective, this state response is doomed to fail given the complexity of global financial markets and the mercurial nature of electronic money. By contrast, the reassertion-of-control perspective suggests that state actors can draw on information-communication technologies to enhance their capacity to monitor flows of illicit funds. This paper argues that both perspectives are seriously flawed. Focusing on the US context, a third perspective is offered. This perspective argues that law enforcements capacity to police money laundering is indeed being undermined but it is a mistake to view the information revolution and financial globalization as the primary drivers of this state of affairs. While these factors have played a role, it is the US State that has been the primary author of its own-money laundering control problems. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the implications of the analysis for the broader debate on the question of whether the regulatory capacity of states are declining in the global information age."

The Taiwan Apple Daily was selected for its innovative interaction mechanisms, including focus group, corrections and comments section in the paper, and Web message boards, to systematically gather and analyze readers feedback. One of the most important findings of this study is that the most critical comments came from the most avid readers. They seem to get used to the unusually cluttered layout, but constantly complained about the superficiality of news content. Because of the papers willingness to involve readers in the news production process, readers are establishing a dynamic relationship with the paper, the kind of relationship that has long been considered unnecessary or undesirable by local newspapers that have a wider base of readers through subscriptions. Readers are treated as information consumers at the Apple Daily. The paper tries to give readers what they want. What does the success of the Taiwan Apple Daily tell us about its readers? What are the short-term and long-term effects of the paper on its readers? If a newspaper is so willing to change its relationship with its readers, how will that change the social functions of a newspaper and the social roles played by journalists? Newspapers are playing a more active role in changing their relationships with readers, thus rewriting the process of mass communication. Further research will help us better understand the paradigm shift and its significance."

Data collected using a Web-based survey concerning the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq (N=307) are used to examine the relationships among media use, political discussion, and civic participation. Respondents for the survey were purposively recruited through discussion groups, weblogs, and listservs discussing the U.S.-Iraq conflict. These respondents, while not representative of the U.S. population or even Internet users, provide unique insights into the role of the Internet in encouraging anti-war activism among some citizens. Analyses reveal that among these respondents Internet news use contributed to both offline and online discussion about the situation in Iraq. In addition, analyses indicate that online and offline political discussion mediated the effects of news media use on civic participation  both traditional forms and protest participation  around the war in Iraq. As a result, this case study stresses the complementary role of Web news use and online political discussion relative to traditional modes of political communication. Implications for future research on news media use, political discussion, and civic activism are discussed."

Due to its inherent characteristics, the Internet has become an engine of political mobilization and participation, and led to the proliferation of online communities. Few studies examine how political groups use the Internet to build communities and forge alliances in the cyberspace, and this study attempts to bridge this gap. Registered political parties and political expression groups in Singapore were selected for this study. Through hyperlink analysis, the study shows that reciprocity and similarity, two main characteristics observed in online communities, were found in the groupings formed by these political groups. This study also reveals that only a minority of political groups in Singapore use hyperlinks to advance their political agenda on the international level. Interestingly, most of the online alliances established by these groups reflect their associations offline."

Specifically, this study looks at influences of the use of public affairs websites, business websites, entertainment websites, special interest websites, and education websites in addition to the amount of time spent in chat rooms and with email. Data from the 2002 General Social Survey is used to examine the relationship between these distinct types of Internet use and participation in social groups. Our findings demonstrate that different types of website use do, indeed, have different effects on participation in civic and social organizations. In particular, the use of entertainment websites is negatively related to levels of participatory capital, while the use of special interest and education websites is positively related to participation in community organizations and social groups. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that email use is positively related, while time spent in chat rooms is negatively related to participatory capital. Suggestions for future research are also outlined."

The limitations and possibilities to develop a Taiwanese cultural identity based on heterogeneity are indicated through 1) the global and local brands interpretations of Taiwans local identity; and 2) the social implications of cultural hybridity in Taiwanese advertising of both the global and local brands. The analysis of the operation of cultural hybridity in the narrative structure of these commercials then see how the modern local identity are re-invented through re-organizing the signs of gender, ethnicity, class, the foreign, and the local, in which new meanings can be produced and specific social changes of gender relations are signified."

The purpose of this research is to determine how the Israeli peace movement has been covered in the US press, and in so doing, to gain a clearer understanding of the complex relationship between movements and media over time and, more specifically, the types and effectiveness of the frames utilized by both sides in order to explain the complicated peace process in the Middle East to American readers. The results that emerged from the study suggest that the Israeli peace movement has successfully managed to legitimate itself as a mainstream force in press coverage of the region and has carved out a niche for itself as a reliable source of information on illegal settlements in the Occupied Territories, which provides it with an expert entry point within media coverage of the peace process. Study results also suggest that the peace movement has regularly been framed as on the verge of collapse and whose existence and struggles are evidence of the deep divisions within Israeli society. As a result, many newspaper articles negatively framed peace movement efforts as futile and contributing to dangerous polarizations in Israel. Often, however, many of the articles depicting these internal tensions, placed blame on the Palestinians for failing to negotiate in good faith or curtail violence. In this sense, the Israeli peace movement was regularly framed as victims of Palestinian betrayals of their misguided hopes for peace."

The study examines the differences in role perception based on geography, economics and the level of freedom of the press. Within this framework a model of dual sequences is presented. This new model proposes two dimensions  that of involvement with society and that of adversary towards the loci of power in society  which have bearing on the functional perception of journalists. The results of the study shows a rather consensual perception of journalistic role, cross geo-political characteristics  neutral, detached from society and defensive toward the loci of power."

This paper examines the linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) in the context of people's interpretations of a race-related television news story. The LIB suggests that people use more abstract language to describe members of outgroups performing negative behaviors compared to those same behaviors performed by ingroup members. This study manipulates the race of a suspect in a TV news crime story and examines how the race influences the abstractness of the language endorsed by White viewers to describe the suspect. The findings offer limited support for the LIB being induced by crime news, thus suggesting that stereotypical news coverage can indeed subtly influence the interpretations people make about members of other social groups."

Instead, the queer women on The L-Word are presented as overtly feminine, which is reminiscent of Western patriarchal ideals of femininity. This study examines the media coverage of The L-Word in U.S. newspapers and magazines. Specifically, this work will address the differing themes amongst publications and the differences in the representation of queer women; including how geography and gender play a role in how lesbianism/bisexualism is contextualized to the public."

Almost always, a specific causal order among the constructs is presumed. Nonverbal behaviors affect judgments of message veracity. The experiment reported here tests if the reverse order might also be possible. A 2 x 2 mixed-model experiment (N = 115) is reported where message veracity (truths, lies) is crossed with foreknowledge of message veracity (veracity known, unknown). The anticipated two-way interaction between message veracity and pre-knowledge of veracity was found. Participants reported observing significantly less eye contact in messages known to be lies than in the same messages in the unknown veracity condition. These data suggest that the knowledge that a message source is lying affects receivers perceptions of the sources behavior. That is, whereas a persons nonverbal behavior affects the extent to which they are seen as dishonest, it is apparently also the case that the extent to which they are perceived as dishonest affects how people see a persons actions."

Instead, I take an alternative position and contend that the program can be read as a subversive text in a few different ways. First, it serves as an overt example of the ways in which gender and sexualitycoalescing here in the form of masculinityare read on and through the body through sedimented, performative practices. Second, the Flab Fours mocking of a hegemonic and lower-class masculinity positions them, and the straight male audience members, as the brunt of the joke; it reifies both metrosexuality and homosexuality. Finally, the parodic performances by the gay male subjects of the show not only expose the fragile coherences of gender performance to the heterosexual male audience, and can be read as using the show as a site of disidentification. Therefore, the show encodes a subversive reading of masculinity, while it simultaneously serves as a space for potential disidentification and resistance for its homosexual subjects. In this way, ""Straight Plan for the Gay Man"" can be viewed as more than just a comic relief or as a gay minstrel show; rather, I argue that the program encodes some potentially powerful and subversive messages with regards to the performance of masculinities its young, middle- class, and heterosexual male audience."

The Initiative was an ambitious effort by a nations top leader to alter the content of the public sphere and deliberately induce both interpersonal dialogue and discussion in the media. This paper examines the fate of a presidents attempt for a relatively non-political and idealistic alteration in the public sphere. It has two major objectives. The first is to illuminate the operation of media logic and reveal how journalistic practices and demands can undermine any democratic effects of presidents going public and indeed negate the value of the bully pulpit. The second is to reveal important and neglected dimensions of the medias continuing, albeit largely unconscious, contributions to racial misunderstanding. By concentrating on the Initiative's alleged procedural defects, neglecting its substantive racial dialogue, and labeling the Initiative a failure from the beginning, the media construction made a reality of failure all but inevitable. However, this was not the doing of journalists alone: it also reflected an uneven framing contest pitting politically maladroit Initiative personnel against a determined opposition party."

The Post-Communist Theory of the Press is applicable to media enveloped in a state of purgatory between communism and democracy. The theory originated from a content analysis of three Croatian newspapers, which revealed that Croatian media could not be grouped into the existing four theories. The results are utilized to present a case for the necessity of the Post-Communist Theory of the Press."

This study examines the effects of the nearly $1 billion National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign on 12-18 year olds through June 2003. It provides one possible theoretical explanation to account for the apparent boomerang effects of anti-drug ad exposure on youth. We propose specifically that the Campaign may have significantly increased the visibility of and attention given to marijuana. Such high visibility may suggest that “everyone is doing it” and thus create a perception of marijuana use prevalence among youth peers. Such perceptions may influence an individual’s cognitions regarding marijuana use in a pro-drug direction.
Methods. Three nationally representative cohorts of youth were surveyed three times an average of 15 months apart. Measures included exposure to Campaign ads and marijuana use-related cognitions including intentions to use marijuana and youth perceptions of marijuana use prevalence among peers. I use an intervening variable analysis to examine if higher levels of ad exposure result in greater perception of prevalent peer marijuana use, and if this belief then encourages more pro-drug outcomes. The study presents correlation and regression analysis including lagged association of exposure to Campaign ads with outcomes.
Results. We found statistically significant evidence to support our claim that perceived prevalence of peer marijuana use represents an intervening variable in the relationship between exposure and marijuana use intentions and can both feasibly and meaningfully explain the unanticipated boomerang effects of Campaign exposure. Support of the hypothesized relationships is particularly compelling due to over time results to definitively substantiate a causal claim."

With the diffusion of the Internet as a channel for mass-mediated political communication hopes arise now to revive the issue of Europe in national public discourses. The paper therefore examines Europes role in national online campaigns in the 2004 European Parliamentary Election by a quantitative analysis of structural, hypertextual, and content-related dimensions of German party and campaign Web sites. Results provide empirical evidence of Europe being a missing link in German online campaigns as Web sites lack a genuinely Europeanized profile, are nationally focused and partisan biased in their hyperlink structure, and replicate the shortcomings of traditional mass medias EU coverage in their online news articles."

This paper reports on a Web-based survey of female and male students in computer science and applied IT programs in five public U.S. universities, designed to determine if there were differences in their demographic characteristics, uses of and attitudes toward computers, and reasons for selecting an IT major. The findings reveal that while some differences exist between the computer science and applied IT students, especially in their demographics, more differences are due to gender than to major, and these tend to replicate earlier findings for computer science contexts alone. At the same time, women's higher enrollments in the applied programs suggest that they see advantages to studying IT outside a traditional computer science environment, such as the possibility of applying computing knowledge to socially-meaningful work."

The university sample size was 136 (F=63.2% and M=36.8%). Motivation was explored via an expectancy value theory conceptualization utilizing the belief system, consisting of perceived competency and perceived probability of success. Next, examined was the need for achievement and goal setting mediated by the belief system variables on task intensity, a measure of level of involvement or motivation.
A two-stage analysis was conducted. First, a measurement model was created through factor analysis. A structural model was developed which described the process of motivation. Result indicate that females tends to be driven by need for achievement and goals; whereas, males tend to be driven by a perceived competence in the task. Notwithstanding this sub process, perceived competence predicts a need for achievement, which then influences goal formulation and, ultimately, task intensity."

Research questions examined the frequency of play in friendship dyads and romantic relationship pairs and the association between frequency of play and relationship solidarity and satisfaction. The perceived appropriateness, effectiveness, and uniqueness of play among friends and romantic partners was also explored. Finally, differences in perceived functions of play across relationship types was explored. The results showed that the frequency of play was similar for friends and romantic dyads, but there were no significant associations between frequency of play and relationship solidarity or satisfaction. While the perceived appropriateness of play was similar between friends and romantic dyads, the effectiveness and uniqueness of play was greater among romantic pairs. Overall, romantic pairs reported more positive functions of play than did friends. Implications are discussed."

Understanding diasporic politics can provide insights for media studies about the intersection of globality and locality and the issue of identity. However, this has remained a marginal area of inquiry in communication studies, particularly in advertising research. With an ever-increasing number of people now defining themselves in terms of multiple attachments, it has become imperative for advertising research to address hybridity, an inherent characterization of globalization. This project examines the discursive construction of advertisements by Bengali immigrants from east India and demonstrates the hybrid existences of diasporic groups, positioning themselves at the crossroads of global and local."
2005-1617,The Netizensumer: A Critical Analysis of Commercial Mobile Narratives,New Media,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,The Netizensumer: A Critical Analysis of Commercial Mobile Narratives,New Media,"Mobile ICTs are attractive to big business, because they offer new modes of colonization of peoples everyday life. Mobile ICTs extend the regulation of consumption to a more ubiquitous (macro) and minute (micro) scale. This regulation takes place, at least in part, at the level of the individual. The push toward the mobile world is in many ways a new wave of modernization taking place within a variety of global, regional, and local contexts. Many mobile narratives in popular culture are designed to normalize this new mobilization of mobility by marketing advanced cell phones as empowering devices for liberated, postmodern individuals. In particular, I see narratives of user citizenship and subjectivity as being central to the contemporary dominant discourse of mobile ICTs. Citizenship, as a concept used to understand peoples ability to participate in society, is increasingly narrativized in mobile representations as being tied to access to networked ICTs. Enhanced user subjectivity via new and wonderful audiovisual experiences and information access is also commonly invoked as a benefit of being mobile and networked."

In this essay, we examine the idiosyncratic development of the communication field in Israel against the background of structural dilemmas, built in the communication field: first, emphasis on research orientation or on professional, journalistic training; and, second, firm boundaries of the field based on the mother disciplines of the humanities or social sciences or, alternatively, open boundaries ready to adopt research topics and methods anchored in different disciplines that touch upon communication phenomena.
The paper relates to the current debate on these issues In US and Europe and suggests a theoretical framework based on criteria anchored in sociology of science. These criteria are then applied to the analysis of the process of institutionalization and development of the Communication Institute (CI) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJ) from its foundation in 1964 through the 1990s. The study is based on documents from the HUJ archive and Guttman Institute for Applied Social Research; curricula and catalogs of communication departments in Israel and interviews with senior researchers in the field."

By inviting the possibility of legitimating a comedy show as a news source, The Daily Show has problematized for journalists the increasingly blurred distinction between news and entertainment. Through an analysis of discourse about The Daily Show as it appeared in major newspapers, magazines, trade journals, and television news transcripts between January 1999 and March 2004, this paper examines how the ascendancy of The Daily Show and its host, Jon Stewart, to the fore of popular, political, and media culture is contributing to evolving notions of journalism and journalistic practice. The Daily Show is considered as a critical incident that has given journalists cause to reflect on current industry assumptions, identities, and standards."

The Next Generation of News: Can Young People be Engaged?

Although there has been a tremendous amount of attention given to the fact that voting among younger citizens has been on the decline, another area of civic engagement where young people lag behind their elders, consumption of political news, has received less attention. Yet this trend may also have serious consequences for the health of our democracy. This paper presents findings from a series of focus groups with 18-24 year-olds during which the participants discussed the reasons they like or dislike the news sources that are currently available and what they would ideally like to see in a news source aimed at their age cohort. Participants expressed a desire for news that is concise, local in focus, less negative, allows the consumer to select the stories to which he or she will be exposed and is not presented by older, white men."
2005-1621,The Online Public Sphere: A Move to Simulation over Representation,New Media,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,The Online Public Sphere: A Move to Simulation over Representation,New Media,"The theoretical foundation for Habermas public sphere, which rests in Enlightenment assumptions of rationality, provides an appealing framework by which to examine public discourse. Yet applications of his theory have remained fixated primarily upon the offline world, and those who do delve into Internet studies assume that the behaviors between the two realms adhere to similar foundationsthe Internet is viewed as an ideal version of Habermas public sphere because of the lack of physical cues traditionally associated with rationality. It is a place where language takes primacy. There are, however, flaws within this interpretation, as it implies 1) that social factors are not imbedded within language and hence that language is an ideal, objective vehicle of expression and 2) that the Internet is a reflection, a representation, of the offline world and should, therefore, reflect offline practices and norms. Using Baudrillards notion of the simulacra and applying this to chat room session logs, this paper will examine the assumptions in both Habermas theory of the public sphere as well as those surrounding Internet discourse. This will show that the Internet is not analogous to its offline companion, and that the conception of the public sphere as a realm where ideas can be freely exchanged is troubled by the advent of the simulation. Indeed, the Internet as simulation ensures that public dialogue has collapsed and that the public sphere as traditionally conceived no longer has meaning."
2005-1622,The Oppression of Opposition: A Feminist Critical Analysis of Relational Dialectics Through Three Lenses,Theorizing the Feminine,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,The Oppression of Opposition: A Feminist Critical Analysis of Relational Dialectics Through Three Lenses,Theorizing the Feminine,"As a result of the commitment in feminist scholarship to social change and corrective action, attention to conceptual clarification at the theoretical level has been comparatively lax. Given the considerable effect that chosen conceptual frameworks has on the structure of knowledge and assumptions about the nature of social interaction, feminist conceptual examinations and reformulations hold an important place in the process of social reformation. This analysis presents an example of this type of needed conceptual reexamination by critically analyzing one approach to the study of personal relationships and relational communication (relational dialectics) through three distinct feminist lenses (liberal, radical-cultural, and postmodern). Results of this analysis suggest that even the most progressive conceptual frameworks possess serious deficiencies that can limit social change and support for corrective suggestions. Furthermore, the importance of clarifying the specific feminist perspective espoused by scholars is illustrated through differences in potential conceptual reformulations and corrective actions associated with the three perspectives."

In fact, much of the health communication scholarship has been historically dominated by E-E efforts directed at subaltern spaces. This article applies a subaltern studies perspective to interrogate the location of agency of the subaltern participant in the dominant E-E discourse. Based on a critical approach to E-E, the article offers points of departure for studying health communication in subaltern spaces. Subaltern voices point toward alternative definitions of problems beyond the narrow realm of problems defined by the core actors in E-E. Finally, alternative positions are suggested for applying participatory communication in engaging with subaltern participants for problem definition and solution development."

Since half of all Americans age six and older play computer and video games and the average age of game player is 29, it is promising to use computer and video games as an entertainment-education form for health intervention. Guided by theories, television and radio based E-E programs for health intervention have been proved to be effective. Considering the fact that traditional media (television and radio) and computer and video games differ in nature in terms of interactivity, we need to be cautious to apply available theories for entertainment education in the domain of gaming. This paper discusses three major lines of theoretical approach for traditional entertainment education and explores the possibility of extend those theories in the domain of interactive media for entertainment education programs for health intervention."
2005-1625,Theorizing for a Technological Press,The Online Challenge to the News,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Theorizing for a Technological Press,The Online Challenge to the News,"Many researchers agree that the four theories of the press compiled by Siebert, Peterson, and Schramm (1956/1963) need to be modified  or completely overhauled  given the changing media, political, economic global landscape. Many of the original commandments of the Hutchins Commission, which called for a socially responsible press, have either been answered, or no longer make sense in a time without the Cold War. This theoretical paper will explore traditional notions of the press in an online, connected world with new information, political, economic and cultural orders. It argues that ultimately, all of these entities will have to answer to a new audience adept at using new technologies. It proposes new definitions and categories of press, journalism and media, and suggests ways to connect these with individual and distinct technological channels by combining a politico-economic approach with cultural studies."

The study was conducted in 31 schools across Israel and included observations and analyses of the plays, interviews with the plays creators and actors, and with school educational counselors. 59 focus groups and questionnaires were admistered to adolescents who saw an antidrug play as part of the schools antidrug program before (n=1816) and after (n=1706) viewing the play, and in four schools where no plays were shown (n=373). The sample included five different plays. Most plays had a realistic and melodramatic narrative that depicted the descent and downfall of the protagonists as a result of their addiction to drugs and a reliance on a true story. A central finding of the study was the importance accorded by both theater personnel and the adolescents to the authenticity of the story. Yet, whereas the adolescent viewers were typically moved by the drama, the main effect measured was more moderate views toward people who used drugs, and attitudes regarding drug use or snitching on a friend who uses drugs were unchanged. The analysis draws on constructs from the literature on media realism, to which a dimension associated with authenticity is added. The discussion points to its advantages and limitations. The studys findings also suggest that when developing entertainment education interventions, asking intended audiences what may influence them is important and nceccesary, but not sufficient."

A Theoretical Consideration of the Relationship Between Television Content, Processing Experience, and the Viewers Everyday Life",Explorations in Cultivation Theory & Research,"This paper proposes an integrative theoretical perspective of the cultivation process, departing from the sociology of knowledge by Berger & Luckmann (1967) who maintain that subjective social reality is organized in zones of relevance, with some social elements being closer, some more remote to an individuals everyday life. It is assumed that media effects depend on this perception of social distance. In this paper, two notions of distance are elaborated for television, experiential and mediated distance. Connections between social distance and cultivation effects are established, making assumptions about the influence of distance on (1) the processing of television information and (2) the construction of a judgment. In an integrative model, research on the heuristic-systematic model (Shrum, 2004; Shrum, Burroughs, & Rindfleisch, 2004), the online processing model of television effects (Van den Bulck, 2003a) and research on transportation into television narrative (Busselle, Ryabovolova, & Wilson, 2004) are integrated within the framework of social distance."

Of particular interest was the potential effect of narrative messages overcoming resistance to persuasion. Three text messages (2 narrative and 1 expository) were constructed based on a segment from a television program about the victims of a drunk driving accident. Results suggested that narratives produced greater affective response and belief change compared to expository messages and belief change persisted one week following message exposure. However, prior experience did not affect the level of belief change in any condition. Implications for future studies are discussed."

The central problem is that of mixing different types of political personalization. This research suggests a typology that distinguishes between various types of political personalization: institutional, media and behavioral. The first controversy concerns the very occurrence of the process of personalization. This study identifies personalization(s) in Israel in all three realms: institutional personalization, expressed in the democratization of candidate selection methods; personalization in the media, expressed in an increase in the focus of media coverage on individual politicians and a decrease in focusing on political parties; and personalization in the behavior of politicians, expressed in an increase in the share of legislation that is initiated through private member bills. The second controversy concerns the causal relationship between the different types of personalization. This study shows that political personalization develops according to the Politics-Media-Politics (PMP) model: institutional personalization leads to personalization in the media, which, in turn, leads to personalization in the behavior of politicians."
2005-1630,The Picturephone Revisited? The Possibilities of Two-way IP Video Communication,Multimedia Experiences with Communication Technology,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,The Picturephone Revisited? The Possibilities of Two-way IP Video Communication,Multimedia Experiences with Communication Technology,"The failure of the AT&T Picturephone was an example of how new ICT that is seemingly useful, ends up not getting adopted by society and turns into a technological obscurity. The limited adoption and subsequent extinction of Picturephone technology in the past has been blamed for numerous reasons such as the intrusiveness of the media, and that it has little added value over normal telephones. Even though in some situations these findings remain true, many aspects have changed with current IP video technology since the Picturephone, namely: 1) price, 2) picture and sound quality and 3) subsequent instrumental uses in education and health care due to 1) and 2). Everyday telecommunication through IP video has also been in use among a limited population of highly technically adept users, but has remained a niche application at best until recently.
Improvements in broadband infrastructure, computer hardware advances and digital camera technology have lowered cost and improved streaming motion picture resolution and sound quality transmission greatly since the Picturephone. Furthermore, a field experiment result of this study indicates that the nature of intimacy of interpersonal relationships may determine who would want to talk on the Internet through video with whom, indicating that IP video communication may not replace telephone or VoIP communication, but has the potential to be adopted more widely for dialogue in everyday life. This paper ends with the possibilities that IP video have for promoting digital inclusion, especially for elder users."
2005-1631,"The Political Economy of Canadian Television Broadcast: ""In the style of"" U.S. programming",tudies of Media in a Variety of National Settings,Mass Communication,,,Paper,"The Political Economy of Canadian Television Broadcast: ""In the style of"" U.S. programming",Studies of Media in a Variety of National Settings,"This paper argues that pervasive industrialization of Canadian broadcast, both in public and private spheres, has had a direct effect on the type of programming produced. Specifically, capital logic has led Canadian content producers to reproduce American-style programming. The political economy of television broadcast provides a framework for this analysis of the industrialization of Canadian mass media and its direct connection to the predetermination of television programming content. By identifying the overdetermined process of commodification in the television industry, in which program content, audiences and ratings are assigned exchange values, it is easy to see the manner in which capital logic directs the form of television broadcasting in general. While this pervasive industrialization may seem appropriate in the instance of private broadcasting, it is counter-intuitive in the case of public broadcasting. Government funding of public broadcast and production in Canada should alleviate the pressures of capital accumulation on subsidized areas of the industry, allowing public broadcasters to provide alternatives to the homogenized programming of the private sector. However, a high level of industrialization exists within the public sector. The CBC, Canadas federal public broadcaster, relies heavily on commercial revenue, denying it any real autonomy from private competition. Furthermore, the very language contained in the mandates of public agencies affiliated with broadcasting defers to industrial goals over cultural aspirations. Combine these factors with the Canadian audiences predilection for American programming, and it is clear why heavy competition in the television industry has resulted in Canadas reproduction of American-style television product."

The purpose is also to compare them to see how they changed.
A quantitative analysis of 76 cartoons found that The Proud Family, a cartoon of the 21st century, is more stereotypical than Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, a cartoon from 30 years ago. Characters in Fat Albert are most often aggressive, intelligent, and witty. Characters in The Proud Family are most often jovial, aggressive, and intelligent. Though primary characters display the same amount of stereotypical behavior, secondary characters show an increase in the amount of stereotypical behavior.
This study extends the amount of research in the entertainment media field by focusing upon animated childrens cartoons. This approach will add to our understanding of stereotypes and the manner in which they are presented to audiences."

It thereby hopes to draw out a specific point that has only been hinted at in Castells: that of the conflict between the Net and the self. The paper does so through one specific case study, presenting a micro-perspective of a particular network. The case study concentrates on a postcolonial, cyberfeminist mailing list, named Undercurrents. Certain exchanges from this list are analysed in detail. The claims made are partly limited through the given example, but they nonetheless help to address this potentially problematic aspect of the network society concept. This problematic aspect is the nature and extent of conflicts in communicative exchanges that make up the networks."

More specifically, the paper analyzes the characteristics and role of transnational partnerships and transnational benchmarking schemes in shaping agendas and processes relating to the dissemination and adaptation of hypermedia in different organizational domains. The transnational partnerships and benchmarking schemes are viewed as instantiations of soft governance techniques of agency and performance and illustrated by examples based on the authors fieldwork: the World Bank initiated Global Knowledge Partnership, the Balanced E-Government Index (BEGIX) launched by the Bertelsmann Foundation, and the Stockholm Challenge. Such transnational partnerships and benchmarking schemes aim to enhance participation and empowerment while promoting competition and self-discipline at the level of organizations and individuals. However, transnational partnerships and benchmarking schemes are also nodes through which the accomplished actors of these emergent organizational forms communicate, flow, mix and create alliances on a transnational scale, while capitalizing on them in domestic and other organizational realms. These nodes are of interest both because of what they offer social actors in terms of knowledge about new hypermedia technologies and their implementation in political, economic and social realms, and because they illustrate how the advent of hypermedia interact with the current reordering of patterns of governance."
2005-1655,The Problem of Surveillance Labor,Watching and Being Watched,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,The Problem of Surveillance Labor,Watching and Being Watched,"The problem of surveillance labor has been recognized in surveillance architectures at least since the 1780s when Jeremy Bentham conceived the panopticon. It is well known that the first aim of the panoptical design was to reduce the effort it took to watch over the carceral theater, automating the effect of surveillance with its famous circularity, central inspection lodge, and individuated cells. Less commentary has been spent on the layer of under keepers who Bentham said would not only subject the inmates to more individuated inspections but who would themselves fall under the watchful eyes of the chief inspector of the panopticon. This paper examines the problem of labor as a weakness of surveillance systems for those overseeing the work, comparing contemporary efforts to manage the division of surveillance labor (Homeland Security, 9/11 Commission Report, etc) with Benthams account of the fundamental advantages of his division of panoptical labor. The paper considers the conditions of surveillance work, the political economy and myths of surveillance, and ponders progressive policy alternatives to the current division of surveillance labor based on potential, if uneasy, alliances with surveillance workers."

Do the same kinds of relationships that media companies have with industries and the government that influence news items also result in perpetuating a patriotic rather than critical or ""objective"" stance towards the U.S. government and its actions? What happens when the news speaks out against the government? What are the consequences of those actions, and when it is normatively acceptable to do so? How does the role of the journalist in the American press corps change at wartime? The first amendment prohibits the government from outright banning of such anti-government sentiment, but the kind of pressure here is more silent and less blatant - it exists under the legal radar in the form of organizational and professional norms, and unspoken agreements that maintain reporter-source relationships, and corporation-policy-maker relationships. The purpose of this paper is to explore what pressures result in media promoting patriotic, rather than critical or objective, views of government, especially in times of war, to what extent this is problematic, and what can and should be done about it."

Conversation Cafés enact a specific set of group processes that create the structure for group conversation and sharing. As such, the cafés provide places to study how structured group discussion creates committed group members. This ethnographic study examines the relationship between communication and commitment in Conversation Cafés. It explores how the Conversation Café process begets member commitment. This study does this by first considering in vivo codes, the ways that participants and group organizers characterize and make sense of the Conversation Café process. Second, the group process is analyzed in terms of the small group commitment model to demonstrate how the process begets ideological commitment. This qualitative case study broadens the understanding of group processes in non-decision-making groups by offering a thick description of how group processes can be used to create committed group members."

We conducted a two-wave surveythe first during the initial development of a community issue and the second just a week before the March 2004 vote. Findings showed that schema (including prior beliefs and attitudes) were the strongest predictor of respondents opinions. Both the tone of discussion (expression of similar versus dissimilar opinions) and perceptions of media favorability toward the issue influenced respondents opinions. We also employed a content analysis to examine the role that political actors play in newspapers. There were significantly more actors favorable toward the issue in media coverage than those who were negative. A regression equation testing for all these filters in the public opinion process revealed that individual components accounted for more variance than social or political components. Comparisons with actual voting results also discussed."

Exploring a Strategic Approach for Political Communication Experts,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,Political Communication,,,Paper,The Professionalization Dilemma. Exploring a Strategic Approach for Political Communication Experts,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,"This paper takes up a discussion initiated by Lilleker & Negrine (2002) about the concept of professionalization being inadequately theorized in the political communication literature. The few studies that attempt a theoretical definition of the professional level of political communication consultants mostly used the classic essential property approach. According to this approach, political communication consultants in most countries, including the United States, fail to meet the essential characteristics of a profession. In an effort to overcome this dilemma, we propose an alternative, hitherto little noticed strategic approach to professionalization that seems to apply more appropriately to the new occupational group of political communication experts. It is also suitable to the demands of international research projects because it is not tied to the specific institutional conditions of the US-American political consultant industry. We present several empirical indicators in order to examine the validity of this new approach and discuss its usefulness as shown by a recent survey of political communication experts in Germany."
2005-1660,The Public Opinion Environment of Organizational Populations,Contingent Factors To Influence Public Relations,Public Relations,,,Paper,The Public Opinion Environment of Organizational Populations,Contingent Factors To Influence Public Relations,"While the term public opinion environment appears intermittently in scholarly and trade publications, its dimensions and characteristics remain largely unspecified. Taking an ecological perspective, this paper conceptualizes and measures the public opinion environment using three cases studies from the same organizational population, Australias major banks. The public opinion environment of an organizational population is composed of issues around which public opinion develops and publics organize. The five dimensions of this issue set, are: stability (turnover of issues), complexity of issues (the number of issues in the issue set), complexity of activist relationships, (number of activist publics), intensity (volume of media coverage), and direction (favorability of media coverage for the focal population). The longitudinal perspective of this study reveals the overlapping and persistent nature of issues. When issues emerge in the public opinion environment of the population, they can persist for many years. This issue-set inertia, has important implications for organizations seeking to monitor and manage their responses to issues."

A regional survey (N = 326) is used to determine how demographic variables, knowledge, experience, and national newspaper use predict future behavioral intention to participate in clinical trials. The survey findings are compared to those from a content analysis of clinical trial messages in two national newspapers (The New York Times and Washington Post). Findings show reading a national newspaper negatively predicts intention to participate in clinical trials. Those confident in having clinical trial risk information provided to them are more willing to participate in clinical trials in the future. Analysis of news content shows national news stories as more negative than positive, although the majority of stories are neutral. Additionally, a few stories contain supplemental clinical trial message risk information or risk translation strategies. The study provides qualified support for second-level agenda setting."

A trait-like, multidimensional inventory of homicidal thought was employed in addition to retrospective reports. Data were consistent with a 7-factor solution. Six of these dimensions were related positively to the number of actual thoughts reported. The finding that media violence exposure predicted recalled homicidal thoughts was replicated. Media violence also predicted scores on several trait-like factors. After controlling for aggression, the pattern of data suggests that media violence is most closely related to reactive thoughts, generated under conditions of negative affect and for whom attention to homicide in the mass media is most likely. Results are discussed in terms of fitting homicidal thinking into the process models of other aggressive thinking."
2005-1664,The Relationship Between E-government Use and Political Participation Through Traditional Channels: The Theory of Channel Complementarity,tudies on Channel Complementarity,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,The Relationship Between E-government Use and Political Participation Through Traditional Channels: The Theory of Channel Complementarity,Studies on Channel Complementarity,"The exponential growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the use of the information by government agencies and offices to reach out to the members of the public. E-government has become a critical component in the literature on online communication, with specific inferences made about the ability of the medium to foster democratic participation, economic growth and better communication between the government and the public. In spite of the growing literature on e-government, little research has been conducted about the relationship between the use of e-government and the use of more traditional media to connect with the government. Based on the theory of channel complementarity, this article compares the users of e-government with non-users to suggest that the users of the online platform will be more likely to communicate with the government via traditional platforms as compared to non-users."
2005-1665,The Relationship Between Online Political Participation and Traditional Political Participation:The Theory of Channel Complementarity,Communication and Citizenship Revisited,Political Communication,,,Paper,The Relationship Between Online Political Participation and Traditional Political Participation:The Theory of Channel Complementarity,Communication and Citizenship Revisited,"The Internet has experienced rapid growth in the last several years. As a major source of information gathering and a useful tool of information releasing and disseminating, the Internet has been studied in the context of its effects on political participation. Drawing from the theory of channel complementarity, this article examines the relationship between political motivation and online political participation. Building on the motivation-based framework, it demonstrates a positive relationship between the use of the Internet for political purposes and the more traditional forms of political participation."

In part one, 151 lower-division undergraduate students completed a survey rating their own verbal aggression, their mothers and father's verbal aggression and corporal punishment practices, and their relational satisfaction and closeness to each parent. In part two, mail surveys measuring verbal aggression were sent to 280 parents; 67% of parents returned the surveys. The data were largely consistent with the hypotheses. Most notably, there were strong negative correlations between perceived parent verbal aggression and relational satisfaction and closeness in all four instances, and moderate negative correlations between parents use of corporal punishment and relational satisfaction and closeness in eight of 12 instances. Further, there were low to moderate positive correlations between perceived parent verbal aggression and corporal punishment in all six instances. Finally, self-report mother verbal aggression was positively related to minor corporal punishment and most severe instance, and negatively related to relational satisfaction. However, there was no relationship between self-report father verbal aggression and any of the dependent variables under investigation. Additional hypotheses and research questions are tested, and results and implications discussed."

The present study estimates and explains, within a diffusion of innovation and social capital framework, over-time changes in encryption practices in a mid-western community. A 250% increase in the prevalence of wireless networks was accompanied during the study period (August 2003-May 2004) only by modest increase in encryption practices. While in 2003 about 20% of residential networks were encrypted, in 2004 this figure rose to only 30%. Formal social capital is found to be a significant predictor at neighborhood level of changes in encryption practices."
2005-1668,The Relevance of Identity and Community Links in Reaching Indias Men Having Sex with Men,HIV/AIDS Communication for High Risk Groups,Health Communication,,,Paper,The Relevance of Identity and Community Links in Reaching Indias Men Having Sex with Men,HIV/AIDS Communication for High Risk Groups,"There are about 3,970,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in India. Most efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS and promote safe sex target heterosexual behavior. Homosexuality is rendered invisible due to social stigma and lack of legal protection. Given this social climate, men having sex with men (MSM) continue to be at risk, with little effort on the part of campaign designers to understand and address the factors that make them vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. The current study identifies the communication issues involved in addressing MSM and addresses questions concerning identity and community ties in reaching this invisible population. Furthermore, it reveals certain socio-political, economic and cultural factors that influence risk perception among MSM.
Micro-level variables such as sexuality and self-efficacy (with respect to safe sex negotiation and condom use), mediate the impact of influential social communities at the mezzo-level in advocating safe sex and normalizing condom use. However, at the macro-level, the restrictive communication environment hinders the symbiotic interrelationship at the micro and mezzo levels by denying the existence of this group and, consequently, excluding them as a population at risk."
2005-1669,The Representation of Poverty in TV Reports in Belgium. Who is to Blame?,Media Representations,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Representation of Poverty in TV Reports in Belgium. Who is to Blame?,Media Representations,"This study analysed how the two main Belgian TV stations in Flanders represent poor people in non-fiction programmes, such as human-interest reports and docu-soaps, on the basis of a qualitative and interpretative content analysis. It was expected to find that the reporters would search mainly for extreme forms of poverty (homeless people, beggars) and visualise those elements that confirm the stereotypes of poverty. The results showed, however, that the programmes represented quite a variety of poor people and forms of poverty. Secondly, we analyzed who or what is depicted as responsible for instances of poverty. If the victim is blamed, it can become more difficult to create public support for policy measures. Four explanatory models were predefined and conceived as media frames: on the hand the individual model of responsibility and the individual model of accident, and, on the other hand, the societal model of responsibility and the societal model of accident. The main conclusion was that in the reports little attention was paid to the broader context of the issue. The programmes are designed to entertain rather than to inform the viewer. The approach to portray individual poor people and let them explain their situation without a broader explanatory framework, results in an implicit message that society does not or cannot do anything to combat poverty. No political solutions are proposed or demanded, neither is current or past government policy evaluated. As such, the reporters promote the societal responsibility model more than the model that blames the victim."

I focus on the case study of UMass-Amherst, where a student group has tried to establish unisex bathrooms to benefit transgender people, but has encountered resistance from the administration and conservative press on campus.
Using ethnographic interviews and discourse analysis, I analyze the rhetoric against unisex bathrooms. This rhetoric is centered on three major concerns: public morality, safety, and cost to the public. These concerns reveal the deeply seated anxieties associated with gender, sexuality, and power in the society. This research helps reveal the ideological constructions of the gendered body in public spaces, and invites critical rethinking of the practices of gender segregation in society."

In addition, the effects of different host and studio audience reactions towards the politician were analyzed. To do so, an experiment with a 2 x 3 x 3 factorial design was conducted (n= 356). The stimulus material has been produced in a TV studio. An actor (as politician) was instructed to show either offensive or defensive nonverbal behavior. Analogically, the host showed either positive, negative, or neutral reactions during the politicians (actors) speech. The results indicate a clear influence of a politicians nonverbal behavior and the TV hosts nonverbal reactions on the recipients image-perception."
2005-1672,The Role of Exposure Frequency and Prominence in Effects of Brand Placements on Brand Image,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,Information Systems,,,Paper,The Role of Exposure Frequency and Prominence in Effects of Brand Placements on Brand Image,Cognitive and Physiological Approaches to Understanding Advertising,"A survey as well as an experiment were conducted to study the effects of prominence and exposure frequency to TV brand placements on brand memory, brand image and brand attitude. Both studies showed that brand placements affected brand memory. Furthermore, the results showed that recognition increased and brand images became more in agreement with the image of the program, as people saw more episodes of the program. These effects also held when controlled for demographics, product use and attitude toward brand placement. Important finding is that brand memory and brand image were not related. Thus, brand image became more positive regardless of memory of the brand placements. These findings have important implications for the understanding of the working of brand placement. The studies indicate the applicability of conditioning and learning theory to brand placement."
2005-1673,The Role of Human and Non-Human Agents in Problem-Formulation,New Systems Perspectives in the Study of Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,The Role of Human and Non-Human Agents in Problem-Formulation,New Systems Perspectives in the Study of Organizational Communication,"In line with recent theorizing on the communicative constitution of organizations (see Cooren & Fairhurst, 2005), this project seeks to expand the notion of agency within organizations to include human and nonhuman agents. The formulation of problems and solutions is examined as an ideal discursive site in which organizational participants negotiate the role of various agencies in organizational action. Our thesis is illustrated through a discourse analytic examination of a university faculty senates discussion of a problematic decision made by an acting dean during a budget crisis. This analysis illustrates how problem formulation can be described and conceptualized as an interplay between various agents including human, textual, and other nonhuman agents. Implications are discussed more generally regarding the role of human and nonhuman agents in the construction of organizational reality."
2005-1674,The Role of Instant Messaging as a Tool for Organizational Communication: An Exploratory Field Experiment,Technology and Mediated Communication in Organizations,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,The Role of Instant Messaging as a Tool for Organizational Communication: An Exploratory Field Experiment,Technology and Mediated Communication in Organizations,"Millions of adults currently use instant messaging (IM) in the workplace and yet there is very little research examining how use and perceptions of this new medium affect intra-organizational communication. While one of the characteristics of instant messaging is the ability to exchange real-time communication, what truly distinguishes instant messaging from other widely adopted forms of mediated communication is the integration of presence technology, which allows parties to detect if others are online and available to communicate. In this paper, we propose a theory of productivity benefits of presence-aware communication technology, building upon past research. Based on this model, we use a quasi-experimental longitudinal research design with quantitative and qualitative methods to test how providing instant messaging to selected workgroups at a Fortune 1000 company impacts employees attitudes and work behavior. Results suggest that IM use had a positive effect on improving productivity with participants citing reductions in voice mail and phone tag, improvements to how easy it was to see if colleagues were online and available to communicate as well as increased productivity served by back-channel communications conducted via IM. Results and future research directions are discussed."
2005-1675,The Role of Organizations in the Modern Society: An Outlook from the Perspective of Systems Theory,Organizational Communication Interactive Paper Session,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,The Role of Organizations in the Modern Society: An Outlook from the Perspective of Systems Theory,Organizational Communication Interactive Paper Session,"New system approaches lead to a different understanding of how organizations are composed and reproduced as social systems. But they also shed light on the role of organizations in modern society. With the help of the concept of functional differentiation, the central characteristics and challenges of these societies are analysed. One of the challenges is the problem of integration. Whereas the integrative function of negotiation systems has already been discussed, the relevance of organizations for integration has not yet been focused upon. The central idea developed in the paper is that organizations play an important role for integration in modern societies by designing their decision programs in a special manner. These programs reflect more than the dominant rationality of the functional system to which they assign themselves. Since decisions turn out to be contingent, they call for justification with regard to the general public as well as to the organizational members. The content of organizational communication media reflects the contingencies and justifications. By discussing the role of organizations in society via a systems approach it is possible to derive the function of communication that media organizations make use of (such as newspapers for employees or business-television). This function differs from what we know from the public sphere. In addition to this, it is possible to use insights from mass media, especially from studies of editorial departments and from information technologies for the benefits of organizational communication."

Starring mega-actors and directed by an award-winning director, the Bollywood Hindi film Phir Milenge exemplifies what is commonly referred to as the entertainment-education communication strategy. We discuss the entertainment-education strategy in HIV/AIDS prevention, including the role of popular mainstream feature films in stimulating the public discourse on HIV and AIDS. Our multi-pronged research design to gauge Indian audience responses to Phir Milenge is described, and the results presented."
2005-1677,The Role of Presence in the Experience of Electronic Games,Online Games,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,The Role of Presence in the Experience of Electronic Games,Online Games,"The concept of presence has become central to research on many forms of new media technology. This paper examines how presence relates to the experience of electronic games. It begins by defining the presence. Then it provides a more detailed discussion of how developments in game technology are related to three dimensions of presence: spatial presence (feeling in a media environment), social presence (feeling with a mediated other), and self presence (experiencing a virtual self as an actual self). Finally we argue that changes in presence corresponding with technological advances not only affect electronic game use, but also shape user experiences that govern the development of mental models and other outcomes of exposure."
2005-1678,The Role of Research in Communications Policy: Theory and Evidence,Policy Research From Multiple Perspectives,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,The Role of Research in Communications Policy: Theory and Evidence,Policy Research From Multiple Perspectives,"This paper develops a theoretical framework for studying the role of research in communications policymaking and presents first findings of a project examining these relations for the United States. At a conceptual level, the paper distinguishes between the epistemic base of communications policy, ideas that influence communications policy and practical knowledge that is used to design specific policy measures. The relations between these areas of knowledge are complicated and multifaceted but lie at the root of understanding the role of research in policymaking. The paper also presents selected findings from two case studies (media ownership, spectrum policy) that allow a more detailed examination of some of the conceptual claims. As the cases illustrate, research does matter but many contingencies apply to whether it is recognized and influential. The paper concludes with a brief synthesis of the main insights and an analysis of the structural conditions of policymaking and academic research that might impede a more fruitful exchange of information between the two realms."
2005-1679,The Role of Spirituality in Breast Cancer Information Processing between African American and Caucasian Women,Breast Cancer Communication,Health Communication,,,Paper,The Role of Spirituality in Breast Cancer Information Processing between African American and Caucasian Women,Breast Cancer Communication,"Spirituality seems to influence how African American women process health messages. It is, however, not clear how spirituality can impact health-related outcomes in the context of health message processing models such as the Extended Parallel Process and the Risk Perception Attitude framework. Using a survey of African American and Caucasian women in the context of breast cancer, the role of spirituality and its interactions with perceived efficacy and risk was examined on four health outcomesmessage acceptance, talking about breast cancer, information seeking, and behavioral intentions. For African American women, spirituality had a positive impact for talking about breast cancer through an interaction with risk and efficacy such that highly spiritual women with high efficacy and low risk were more likely to talk about breast cancer than when efficacy was low. However, high spirituality exacerbated the negative effects of efficacy on talking about breast cancer regardless of the risk level for Caucasian women. Spirituality also had a positive influence in attending to breast cancer information in the media for African American women. Spirituality played no role in attending to breast cancer information for Caucasian women. Interestingly, spirituality played no role for African American women on behavioral intentions. However, spirituality worked to decrease behavioral intentions for Caucasian women when risk was high."
2005-1680,The Role of Television and Advertising in Stimulating Materialism in Children,tructional/Developmental Communication Interactive Paper Session,Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,The Role of Television and Advertising in Stimulating Materialism in Children,Instructional/Developmental Communication Interactive Paper Session,"The message to consume appears not only in advertising, but also in much of television content. The present study examines the roles that television, advertising and family communication play in stimulating materialism in children. We also examine the relationship between materialism and contentedness, and the efficacy of two media literacy videos designed to reduce materialism and trust in advertising. A survey administered to 212 children aged 10  14 demonstrated that higher levels of television exposure, advertising recognition, trust in advertising, and consumer communication each predict higher levels of materialism. Neither socio-oriented nor concept-oriented family communication patterns moderated the relationship between advertising/television and materialism. Materialism was not related to contentedness, but higher levels of television exposure predicted lower levels of contentedness. Of the media literacy videos assessed, only the 20 minute edited version of the PBS documentary ""Affluenza"" significantly reduced both materialism and trust in advertising."

Accordingly, when the FCC announced a review of several broadcast-ownership rules in September 2002, it seemed as though business as usual would guarantee the outcome favored by the large media conglomerates. However, during its review the FCC experienced an outpouring of public criticism of the agency in a flood of e-mails, letters, and phone calls to the FCC and members of Congress. After the FCC raised the ownership limits (a move that was widely seen as another boon for the media conglomerates) a court ruling eventually blocked implementation of the changes. These events raised the question: Can alternative voices effectively participate in the broadcast policymaking process? This paper reviews the factors working against public involvement in the broadcast policy-making system of the U.S. and the countervailing factors that have made the recent intervention possible. In order to help delineate these elements the authors conducted private first-person interviews with FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, and former FCC Commissioner Nichols Johnson to discuss their exceptional efforts to better involve the public in the broadcast policymaking process during their service on the FCC. From our analysis, it appears that the factors facilitating greater public involvement have developed to the point where, at least sometimes, the public and civil society organizations can either block, or at least modify, the demands of entrenched corporate interests."

This qualitative study used observation and interviews to identify patterns in communicative behaviors of students and tutors. The findings were explicated using Berger and Calabreses (1975) Uncertainty Reduction Theory, and they included the following: a) ESL students initial anxiety can be alleviated by small talk; b) ESL students experience uncertainty upon subsequent visits; c) when the tutor successfully reduces students anxieties, the tutor is perceived as effective; and d) effective tutors are well-liked by students, prompting follow-up appointments. This report also provides a literature review and suggestions for application and future research."

Beeping involves calling a number and hanging up before the mobiles owner can pick up the call. The mobiles call log and address book functions signal who called, and when. Most beeps are requests to the mobile owner to call back immediately, but beeps can also send a pre-negotiated instrumental message such as pick me up now, or send a relational sign, such as Im thinking of you. Based on interviews with small business owners and university students in Rwanda, the paper identifies the rules of beeping and assesses its significance using a variety of frames, including linguistics, structuration, and communication technology and economic development. The paper contrasts beeping with SMS/text messaging, and suggests paths for future research."

We present a preliminary content analysis of nanotechnology coverage in the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and Associated Press for the period 1 January 1986 to 30 June 2004. Media attention to nanotechnology seems to parallel coverage of biotechnology in its early stages of issue developmentstarting out low and rising sharply as it spreads from elite media outlets to more general outlets. As with biotechnology, coverage of nanotechnology throughout this period is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on progress and potential economic benefits, and with little discussion of attendant risks. Nanotechnology coverage does, however, focus more on risks from the outset than biotechnology did, suggesting that issues of public accountability are growing more salient to journalists. We conclude with comments about the possibility of a theory of media coverage of emerging technologies."

Borrowing from organizational social network theories, and extending them to semantic networks, this study unpacks the nature of U.S. Presidential debate discourse to determine if there are communicative differences between electoral winners and losers. Analyses of nine years of Presidential debates indicate an emergent pattern in how candidates discuss the issues, as depicted by semantic networks, and their winning or losing the election year campaign. In other words, this study demonstrates that semantic networks enabled a systematic way to differentiate election year winners and losers in terms of the content of Presidential debates: Regardless of party affiliation, electoral winners were more central and the electoral losers were more peripheral. Although the ICA deadline preempts knowing the 2004 campaign outcome, the data presented in this paper indicate that Kerrys semantic networking is more consistent with that of previous election year winners."
2005-1686,The Sensemaking of Organizational Mission: A Conceptual Model and Extension,dentification and Sensemaking in Organizations,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,The Sensemaking of Organizational Mission: A Conceptual Model and Extension,Identification and Sensemaking in Organizations,"Organizational mission continues to be one of the most widely used managerial strategies. However, there is relatively little systematic research, and even less conceptual development in this area. This paper begins to address this gap by detailing a sensemaking perspective as a conceptual framework for future research on organizational mission by building an inductive argument using interview data collected from a bureaucracy and a virtual organization. It then proposes a type of analytical dualism as a conceptual extension to sensemaking, arguing for a focus on patterns in employees interpretations or understandings of the mission of their organization as both an outcome of previous sensemaking processes and a representation of frames of reference for future behavior. Third, it identifies semantic network analysis as an empirical technique that facilitates examination of this outcome. The paper concludes by specifying how this approach may be used in future sensemaking studies."
2005-1701,The Sequencing of Two Communication Models within Change: An Empirical Comparison of Two Organizations,Communication and Organizational Change,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,The Sequencing of Two Communication Models within Change: An Empirical Comparison of Two Organizations,Communication and Organizational Change,"The on-going and unremitting nature of new product development, shifting consumer and stakeholder priorities, and government reform create intense pressure for public sector organizations to commercialize, and for private sector organizations to be flexible (Zorn, Page & Cheney, 2000). Whilst most change processes are based on Lewins (1952) unfreeze-change-refreeze concept, the pressure faced by the public and private sectors to change continuously renders the Lewinian three step change models obsolete as time to refreeze is a rare commodity. This study investigates the communicative processes of change to address the identified knowledge gap in understanding the role, import and effect of communication in a continuous change environment. Using data from two longitudinal empirical studies, we extend Van de Ven and Pooles (1995) typology of change theories to accommodate the sequencing of two change communication models; monologic and dialogic change communication. The findings suggest that the sequencing of the two change communication models is informed by individual competencies and group expectations. Future research must consider the issues associated with sustaining and embedding of the communicative sequences in organizational change in order to avoid organizations being reliant on exceptional managers."

Dialogue is a process through which we construct the self and the other, achieve mutual understanding for community, establish communicative reason, reach general consensus on principles, connect the meanings of our private lives to public issues, and become a part of the political world, especially in the age of pervasive interpersonal (digital) media."

White House news releases, briefings and speeches and news stories from five major newspapers were analyzed. It was found that the news media generally followed the White Houses framing of the story. However, when major combat in the Iraq War was declared over in May 2003, there was a slight shift in emphasis: News media continued to report on the smallpox threat, while the White House frames changed slightly to emphasize terrorism more and smallpox less."
2005-1704,"The Social Amplification of Commercial Aviation Risks: A Longitudinal Analysis of Media Effects on Air Travel Behavior, 1978-2001.",Mass Communication High Density Session,Mass Communication,,,Paper,"The Social Amplification of Commercial Aviation Risks: A Longitudinal Analysis of Media Effects on Air Travel Behavior, 1978-2001.",Mass Communication High Density Session,"This paper is broadly concerned with the role of the mass media in processes of social amplification of low-probability high-consequence risks. It undertakes a case study of fatal commercial accidents over a long period of time (1978- August 2001). It was hypothesized that: a) monthly variations in news media coverage of fatal accidents are negatively associated with the monthly number of passengers boarding commercial US carriers over time; b) volume of coverage produces its effect on air travel behavior in interaction with the death toll claimed, the monthly density of accidents, and with the intensity of speculations and statements about terrorism made in the media in connection to a fatal accident.
Results of time series analyses offered some support for these hypotheses. Evidence was gathered for a synchronous media effect on behavior that is also non-linear: it emerges after a threshold and levels off at high levels of coverage. Evidence for the three interactions was found if one assumed a baseline of nonlinear coverage effects as well. The significant interaction between volume of coverage and density of accidents on air travel behavior speaks to the plausibility of time-compressed societal reactions to risks. The interaction with statements about terrorism buttresses claims about a true media effect on travel behavior, found in the conjunction of volume of coverage and media representations of an accident as possibly caused by terrorism."

What were the preferred political meanings ascribed to these images when they first entered public discourse, that is, when they were originally published and framed by the two venerable journalistic institutions that broke the Abu Ghraib story, CBS 60 minutes II and The New Yorker Magazine? And, in retrospect, how did these two competing news reports help set the stage for the following public debate over how to understand the content and political implications of the abuse photographs? Further, I separate out the topical news media framings of these photographs by comparing, and contrasting, them with larger historical and cultural frameworks of meaning. Drawing on seminal work in the field of visual studies, I argue that the Abu Ghraib images at once draw on and help articulate deeper cultural themes and motifs which, if acknowledged, have specific implications for our explanation and interpretation of them. The paper presents an in-depth historical analysis of three crucial iconographic points of reference: the American lynching photographs, the photographs that German soldiers took of their comrades torturing and murdering civilians and prisoners of war during World War II, and the photographs of the killing fields left behind by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In conclusion, I argue that the most important effect of the Abu Ghraib images is probably the long-term cultural impact, not the short-term political effect."

The thirty-nine researched articles cover OPR related topics over the past two decades. Each article was coded for journal, year of publication, authorship, research design, sample size, sampling methods, definition, theoretical framework, interdisciplinary perspective, types of OPR, construct, outcomes, measurement variables, maintenance strategies, and future research direction. These were the predominant articles regarding OPR published in recent years and only two scholars were the primary conductors of the OPR research. Implications of the study findings and limitations are discussed in detail."

Discussion is conceptualized as the structure of the relationships among participants. The 2004 discussion group was found to be centralized, as opposed to the 1990s. That supports the suggested relation between a size of a network and its structure. The structure of the 2004 discussion is hierarchal; a few dominant participants (hubs) attract a disproportionate number of responses. This structure of the discussion shows that hubs play a major role in the discussion in two ways. First, they have control over the flow of information in the discussion, while most participants are very unlikely to affect the discussion. Second, they operate as anchors in the discussion, because their messages evoke longer discussions. This put them in a critical position: a removal of hubs will damage the flow of information in the discussion."

While mainstream economists are trying to explain open source movement by self-interested economic incentives, the structures of open source projects examined based on co-membership networks of operating systems, software licenses, target audiences, and topics, showed that there is no strong tendency pursuing individual or economic incentives. Network centrality trends were traced using co-membership network analysis. Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP) method was used to compare the structures of networks."

SETTING: Outpatient offices of community-based physicians in urban Los Angeles and rural Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: 302 patients visiting 77 physicians in 41 clinics. MEASUREMENTS: Physicians' opening questions were assigned to one of five types. Patient problem presentation was measured in seconds and in terms of the number of current symptoms presented. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with physicians use of question type. ANOVA was used to determine the influence of question type on the extent of patient problem presentation. RESULTS: Five types of physician opening question were identified, based on the stance they take regarding physicians' pre-existing knowledge of patients' problems and the constraints they exert on patients' immediate answers. General-inquiry questions (e.g., What can I do for you today?) were most common (62%), followed by questions that invited confirmation of either general evaluations of patients conditions (11%) or specific symptoms (16%). Mean length of problem presentation was 21.4 seconds. Compared to confirmatory questions, general-inquiry questions were associated with significantly longer problem presentations (p<.0001) that included more current symptoms (p<.0001). Patient age was also positively associated with presentation length in seconds (p=.01), though not the number of symptoms presented. Physicians were more likely to use confirmatory questions in the urban setting (p=.003)."

It analyzes the social-interactional organization of problem presentation, focusing on how participants recognize and negotiate its completion. It argues that physicians and patients mutually orient to the presentation of current symptoms  that is, concrete symptoms presented as somehow being experienced in the here-and-now  as a locus of transition between patients presenting problems and physicians gathering information about them (i.e., history taking). This organization is a resource for physicians to distinguish between complete and incomplete presentations, and for patients to manipulate this distinction."

This paper argues that the stories which characterised the Iraq War of 2003 are indicative of a battle for credibility not only between governments, but between different media outlets, and between media and governments about who best served the public interest. The changes in the global media structure and its effects on foreign news reporting are discussed as well as the relationships between certain media and certain governments. We are confronted by fundamental contradictions in journalism between independence and impartiality, and loyalty to audiences in this new culturally relativistic broadcasting landscape. It is argued that the Arab satellite channels, with their awareness of Arab opinion as well as with Western journalistic norms, signify a qualitative broadening of transnational micro public spheres at a time when the credibility of Western news organisations have been undermined."

This study was a textual analysis to examine how mainstream and African-American newspapers framed the phenomena of racial profiling two years before and two years after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Findings indicate that mainstream and African-American newspapers varied greatly in their frames pre-September 11, but these differences decreased after the tragedy."

The model hypothesizes that (a) anger is malleable, and (b) perceived anger and perceived efficacy interact in affecting systematic processing. Three studies were conducted to test the model. In Study 1, anger themes were categorized based on past research and participants topical generation. In Study 2, anger messages were constructed using the results from Study 1 to induce high, medium, and low levels of anger. Study 3 tested the overall model. Results largely supported the model. However, important inconsistence was also found. Findings and possible explanations for inconsistent findings were discussed."
2005-1714,The Teachers Body: Re-Placing Competence in the Classroom,The Body as Commodity,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,The Teachers Body: Re-Placing Competence in the Classroom,The Body as Commodity,"The ideals of democratic education most often rely on a logic of identity that, as Adorno has argued, denies and represses difference. Iris Young observes that this repression relies on an opposition between public and private dimensions of human life, which corresponds to an opposition between reason on the one hand, and the body, affectivity, and desire on the other (1987; 63). This paper examines the private/public dualisms that construct the female teachers body in the space of schooling. In particular, the paper looks at student evaluations at the end of term to discuss how the female teachers competence is constructed through discourses of the body. Using Foucault, the study focuses on the ways discourses assumed to be private (the body) become part of the public space in order to evaluate intellectual competency. In this manner, the rational discursive space of the classroom is maintained through confusing the conformity of the body with the efficiency of the mind. This paper works toward a pedagogical stance that opens up dialogue with and through this female teachers body. Through drawing attention to how the body performs through (non) conformity, this teacher hopes to not only to deconstruct power/body relations but to offer a means to disrupt them."

The cases were drawn from the US and UK, over a seventy year period. The study draws on concepts from both narrative and framing analysis in order to examine the thematic characteristics of the coverage. The coverage from both countries, in both types of newspapers and across the three periods included personal, institutional and societal narratives. The analysis illustrated three patterns. First, the coverage of these crimes was centered overwhelmingly around an institutional template, focusing on the police investigation and subsequent trial, supporting the evidence of a longstanding, mutually beneficial relationships between journalists and members of the criminal justice system. Second, the coverage from the 1990s was significantly different to the previous two periods as the coverage was less focused on institutional narratives and more on the personal, with a new emphasis on the surviving victims families. Third, the coverage from the latter period also focused heavily on societal narratives, exploring the risks posed by the offenders, framing the coverage through a belief that modern society is characterized by new and more dangerous threats. The result was newspaper coverage which either directly, via the editorial pages, or indirectly through the letters pages called for more restrictive forms of social control and surveillance."
2005-1716,The Theory of Newsworthiness and its Intercultural Validity: A Comparison of Mexican and German News Selection,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,The Theory of Newsworthiness and its Intercultural Validity: A Comparison of Mexican and German News Selection,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"One of the central issues in journalism research is the question of news selection. Besides gatekeeper and news-bias research, the theory of newsworthiness (or news values) is one of the most powerful approaches in that field. Especially Einar Östgaard, Mari Holmboe Ruge, Johan Galtung and Winfried Schulz contributed to develop this theory and empirical instruments. They were able to prove that news factors as properties of events or journalistic hypotheses of reality are suitable constructs to explain news selection or editorial emphasis. But most of the research was limited to western journalism in Europe and the USA. The question, whether news factors and their influence in selection processes depend on cultural parameters beyond the western world still has to be answered. For that reason this study provides some empirical results of a content analysis conducted in Mexico. Three of the most important national newspapers were examined concerning news factors and their influence on editorial emphasis of foreign news stories. Therefore the hypotheses of selection, additivity and  rarely examined  replication (and distortion) were tested. Through the application of similar instruments und operationalizations an intercultural comparison with a German study was possible to examine cultural differences in news selection between Germany and Mexico. The results show that the theory of newsworthiness even is able to explain selection and editorial emphasis in Mexico and so implies universal validity. But also differences between news factors influence in both countries were revealed."
2005-1717,The Third-Person Perception as a Self-Preserving Mechanism,Elaboration of Third-Person Effects,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Third-Person Perception as a Self-Preserving Mechanism,Elaboration of Third-Person Effects,"The prevailing explanation to the Third Person Perception (TPP) argues that people perceive others as more influenced by the mass media than themselves in order to maintain positive self image. This paper applies research about self preserving biases to examine this explanation. Psychological research demonstrates that when the self has already been enhanced, the need to use self-preserving mechanisms is reduced. If the TPP is indeed a self preserving bias, then the motivation for this bias may be reduced as a result of contextual changes influencing short term self-esteem. We test this notion in five studies that manipulated self-esteem in various ways. Overall, the findings suggest that the TPP fulfills a self-preserving function, but this self-preserving function relates to a rather specific region of the self, focusing on susceptibility to persuasion. The findings also expose a new type of question order and context effects. The possibility of using current results as a basis for developing methods to remedy such self-preserving biases in surveys is discussed."

A Comparison of Swedish EU Elections in the Media.,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,"The paper focuses on two main research questions. Firstly, how did the leading national media in Sweden cover the elections for the European Parliament during 1995, 1999 and 2004 with regards to the amount of coverage, dominating aspects and main actors in the news? Secondly, how can differences in the coverage, if any, be explained?
The content in the most widely consumed news media in Sweden was studied using quantitative content analyses during the last three weeks of the EU election campaigns.
The results in this paper confirm a decline in the number of articles and news features. There is also a significant increase in game-framed election news in all kinds of media. The reduced quantity of news material, and especially its game-orientation, can be explained by the growing media market pressure, commercial competition and audience targeting. On the other hand, structural bias is not a general consequence of low-key interest in the elections and media commercialization, but also depends on the perceived newsworthiness among different political actors."

It uses an innovative method based on detailed testimonies of journalists who authored a sample of hundreds of news items to reconstruct the formation patterns of news both before and after the introduction of new communication technologies into the Israeli daily press. Most of the changes found are concentrated in the phase of discovering the news, while the gathering of further information shows almost no change. The dominant technology used continues to be the telephone, with the Internet playing a marginal role. The possible stabilizing forces are discussed."

It is under this proposition that the following analysis investigates the use of mixed method(s) in current organizational communication research and attempts to set an agenda for the further consideration of its use and/or promise in the field of organizational communication. My research questions were: does current organizational communication research employ multiple methods? If so, what proportion of the research uses multiple methods within a study? And what methods are most commonly used for specific research topics. Based on my analysis of the last ten years of organizational communication research in three leading journals, findings indicate that current organizational communication uses multiple methods minimally relative to the high use of quantitative methods across research topics. However, current organizational communication is shifting toward a more common use of multiple methods than in the past. Research of climate and culture in conjunction with group/team and intergroup relations, technology and networks, make up half of the articles published in these three journal during the last ten years, though these topics are mainly studied using quantitative procedures."

Integrating media studies and transnational cultural reception study, the research starts with and focuses on the most popular and influential periodical in the motion picture field of ChinaPopular Cinema. It examines the periodicals discourses and themes on Hollywood films, movie stars and Hollywood events, analyzes various political, historical and cultural forces that have shaped the changing meaning of Hollywood film in China. The study has two basic arguments: First, Chinas reception of Hollywood culture strongly correlates with its drastically changing internal politics. From seeing Hollywood films as reinforcing the traditional Marxist vision of evil capitalism, to seeing Hollywood films as the manifestation of the American way of life, the reception responds to the national project of modernity and the whole nations yearning for reform and opening up to the outside world. It also resonates with the New Enlightenment Move and the Cultural Fever prevailing in the 1980s. Second, the apprehension of Hollywood culture has become the Chinese peoples collective imagination of a modern lifestyle, and thus become part of their search for an alternative modernity."
2005-1722,The War for Women's Freedom: Orientalist Imaginaries of Rescue in Afghanistan,Women and the News,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,The War for Women's Freedom: Orientalist Imaginaries of Rescue in Afghanistan,Women and the News,"This paper examines ways in which misrepresentations of Muslim women in mass media may constitute the basis for arguments justifying military action in times of international conflict. Specifically, the notion of female oppression and voicelessness was central to media coverage of the war in Afghanistan. Empirical examples of such depictions are drawn from three newspapers, The New York Times (United States), The Globe and Mail (Canada), and Dawn (Pakistan), within a specific seven-day period during the war. These examples are analyzed using critical discourse analysis, propaganda models, myth and ritual analysis and dramatism. The findings confirm, to varying degrees, the presence of politicized depictions of Afghan Muslim women in all three newspapers, although there are also encouraging signs of more thoughtful discussion about the actual factors that may oppress Afghan women, or Afghans as a whole. These findings are discussed from various theoretical perspectives, including Orientalism and feminist theory."

The study found that the Web has become a core part of everyday life for most users and that they have formed clear habits of usage, just as with earlier mass media such as newspapers and television. Some of the elements that are forging the new Web experience include pervasive access in homes, offices and public locations; broadband service that is always on and quickly available to users; wireless networks that help bring the Web into any room in a home; the social transformation of the Web from a work tool into a member of the family; and the increasing time that people are spending on the Web. Core usage of the Web includes information, communication, shopping and entertainment. Our understanding of the functions of the Web in people's lives is still at an early stage."

The donors next-of-kin makes the final decision on whether to donate his or her organsa fact that makes open communication between family members about the topic of organ donation crucial. Using a multi-instance approach drawing from both discourse and conversation analysis, this study seeks to understand what occurs during conversation between family members about organ donation through the analysis of twenty video-taped dyadic interactions. This analysis leads to the identification of three communicative techniques used by family members when communicating about organ donationthe scenario question, the real life report, and preemptive diffusion. These three tools by which individuals communicate about organ donation can be used in future endeavors to educate the public about talking to family members about the decision to donate, and are most likely applicable to social interaction beyond the topic of organ donation."

Racial Differences in Food Advertisements Viewed by Children,Health Communication Poster Session,"This study describes a content analysis of a sample of food advertisements aired during television programs heavily viewed by children. Advertisements featuring no Black primary characters were compared on the basis of character and food attributes to ads that did feature Black characters. Foods were then analyzed for their nutritional content and represented in terms of Nutrition Facts labels and recommended daily values (RDVs) of select nutrients. Analyses revealed relatively few, but notable, racial differences. Compared to ads featuring no Black characters, ads with Black characters were more likely to sell convenience foods, especially fast foods, and to contain less sugar. Both types of ads tended to sell nutritionally unbalanced foods: A 2000-calorie diet of foods from both Black-character and nonBlack-character ads would exceed RDVs of total fat, saturated fat, and sodium, yet fail to provide RDVs of fiber and certain vitamins and minerals."

A sample of 383 college students ages 17 to 25 years completed a web-based survey. Relational proximity was not associated with either the experiences of or communicative responses to jealousy. The cognitive and emotional experiences of jealousy, however, were associated with communicative responses to jealousy. Emotional jealousy and cognitive certainty predicted females communicative responses to jealousy. Cognitive suspicion predicted the majority of the males communicative responses to jealousy. Thus, while relational proximity did not influence the participants reports of their experiences or communicative responses to jealousy in romantic relationships, male and female participants reported differing potential triggers to communicative responses to jealousy."

This study has the purpose of providing a framework for synthesizing and organizing the theoretical assumptions found in the public relations literature. It discusses the three metatheoretical approaches identified  functionalist, interpretivist and critical  and looks at their manners of defining public relations and of conceiving public relations issues, as well as their ways of employing theories. It asserts that functionalist definitions of public relations tend to be as precise and clear as possible, to reduce areas of controversy; that interpretivist definitions in the field tend to open up toward concrete situations, unrepeatable spatial-temporal arrangements; and that critical definitions of public relations (although not very much developed yet) tend to take into account hegemony and domination. It also asserts that the functionalist paradigm comprises theories focused on prescribing the best techniques to be used by the organizations management in order to influence internal and external publics; that the interpretivist paradigm consists of theories oriented toward describing the honest and deceptive rhetorical devices employed by corporate leaders and PR executives in order to persuade various publics; and that the critical paradigm is composed of theories focused on disclosing, evaluating and exposing the attempts to control, to impose ideological perspectives, and to promote centers of power."

Noting that the Knowledge-Search websites may be characterized as a hybrid of virtual community and search engine, the current study explores the effects of gratifications of Knowledge-search website use on intensity of use, information-seeking efficacy, and generalized social trust. Based on a cross-sectional survey with college student sample, our findings suggest that channel gratification was significantly and positively associated with intensity of Knowledge-search use; content gratification was significantly and positively associated with information-seeking efficacy, and relational gratification showed a significant and positive relationship with generalized social trust."

An experiment (N=117) set just before a Midwestern states 2004 Democratic presidential primary found that comparative ads featuring attacks on other Democrats in the primary were evaluated more negatively than positive ads or comparative ads attacking Bush. There was no significant difference in ad evaluations between the latter two, however. There were no direct effects from ad tone or target on candidate evaluations. Contrary to past findings, issue ownership had no main effects on ad or candidate evaluations. But issue ownership made a difference in the effect of tone on thought valence, such that ads dealing with Democrat-owned issues were better received when the ads were positive, but tone had no effect on how ads on Republican-owned issues were received."
2005-1730,Toward a Feminist Pragmatism of Participatory Communication,Theorizing the Feminine,Feminist Scholarship,,,Works in Progress,Toward a Feminist Pragmatism of Participatory Communication,Theorizing the Feminine,"Participatory communication for development in recent years has attracted scholarly attention in both the theoretical and pragmatic aspects. Efforts have been made to theorize and define the concept of participation and to analyze the underlying theoretical assumptions of different approaches in development communication. There is, however, one aspect that remains underexplored in development communication literature: feminism. This article intends to develop a feminist pragmatism of participatory communication. Feminist pragmatism of participatory communication has three dimensions: personal/communal, social, and political. The personal dimension of feminist pragmatism pertains to the notion that dialogue is the means for connection and empowerment. Two feminist scholars that value the merits of dialogue and conversation will be introduced: Patricia Collins and Donna Haraway. The social dimension of feminist pragmatism centers on gender issues in participatory development. Given womens unique position in the overlapping of work and family, a feminist perspective on participatory communication recognizes womens unique position in development by addressing issues such as gender inequality in employment, economic oppression, and child rearing, to name just a few. The political dimension of feminist pragmatism sees the process of development as a political struggle. This aspect is based on the writings to deconstruct and reconstruct development discourses, Donna Haraways how to see from below, and Shane Phelans writing on the political nature of identity formation."

This paper outlines the critical position of organizational legitimacy in public relations by tracking its development in organizational studies and demonstrating its importance in building and maintaining the expectations of stakeholders. A model integrating organizational legitimacy and organizational adjustment and adaptation within open systems is proposed, emphasizing the importance of public relations practice in creating and managing the displays of organizational legitimacy.

Further research in this area is also proposed to test the models propositions as well as to investigate the effects of other influences on the model, including organizational lifecycle, organizational monitoring resources, types of legitimacy, and communication channels."

In view of that, the primary goal of this analytic and reflective essay is to build a conceptual model for incorporating critical media literacy into communications pedagogy, particularly in the context of teaching an introductory communications course. In so doing, it first seeks to reconceptualize the term critical media literacy, proceeds to discuss some feasible strategies that can help students become critical users of the media, and then finally presents a number of propositions based on the preceding discussions and personal reflections on teaching an introductory communications course."

Inaccurate goal detection, for example, can adversely affect goal pursuers and detectors communication competence. The current paper discusses three sources of goal detection inaccuracygoal-, perspective-, and context-based determinants. Goal detection inaccuracy can be explained and predicted, knowing when a goal, perspective, or context of a particular social interaction are similar to (and different from) other goals, perspectives, and contexts (respectively). At the grossest level, goal-, perspective-, and context-based similarities impact the extent to which individuals can clearly perceive the linkages (i.e., cognitive associations) between various factors in a social interaction and certain goals. As factor-goal linkages are clearly perceived by a goal detector, the linked goals increase in accessibility, which in turn decreases the goal detection inaccuracy. Three sets of propositions are advanced focusing on how goal-, perspective, and context-based similarities determine goal detection inaccuracy."

In fact, Kovach et al (2004, p. 2) state that an increasing number of journalists are identifying economics as their greatest concern, with 66 percent of national journalists and 57 percent of local journalists surveyed believing increased bottom-line pressure is seriously hurting the quality of news coverage. This paper seeks to provide a theoretical framework which explains this dilemma. The theory articulated challenges views of journalism that conflate journalism with business and media corporations. Drawing on the work of Alasdair MacIntyre (1985, 1994), this paper postulates a theory of journalism that distinguishes between the practice of journalism, the practices of business and advertising and the institution of the media corporation, in an attempt to explain why managers and journalists have different views on the journalistic quality.

Although this concept and the phenomena behind it have been generally accepted, there is no precise definition of the corresponding activities of media users which could be utilized in order to test the construct empirically. Having introduced Suspension of Disbelief on the basis of its historical use as a nonmediation phenomenon and taking into account research on perceived reality and considerations about the distinction between reality and fiction Suspension of Disbelief is defined as a mode of media usage during which the recipient does not scrutinize plot consistency and realism of fiction media content nor does he or she pay attention to corresponding fractions and violations. Finally, the relevance of Suspension of Disbelief for research in communication science will be discussed."
2005-1752,Towards Innovations in Social Information Processing Theory Conceptualization and Specification in Light of an Evolving Job Characteristics Model,Communication in the Brave New Organizational World,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Towards Innovations in Social Information Processing Theory Conceptualization and Specification in Light of an Evolving Job Characteristics Model,Communication in the Brave New Organizational World,"Social information processing theory (SIP) has been developed as a communication approach to organizational theory grounded in the Job Characteristics Model (JCM). Innovations in the JCM call for new conceptualizations in terms of how SIP is conceptualized in relation to the JCM. This paper explores new tools in specifying SIP to meet these challenges. In particular, expanding SIP objects of analysis within the JCM model and looking at SIP not only as a complimentary approach but also as a communication level of analysis within models is called for. Further, given demands that JCM specification take into account organizational environments, SIP is used here as a tool to model elements of leadership, structure, and culture. This is done through specification of quality of relational ties in terms of formal authority structures  communication with supervisors vs. peers. Analysis via social network analytic methods and data support conceptual and methodological innovations in SIP."

It aimed at formulating a framework of policy recommendations with regard to elderly and ICT in 2030. To meet this objective a three-phased methodology was developed, relying on participatory technology assessment techniques and technology foresighting methods. In the first phase of the project, a Delphi study and focus group research provided the necessary information for the development of scenarios about the future. In the second phase, these scenarios were transformed into a theatre play, which was performed for elderly audiences. Group discussions with senior participants led to the formulation of the desired future with regard to elderly and ICT. During the last phase of the project - a backcasting exercise - experts from different fields formulated policy recommendations, necessary to achieve this future."

It provides support for the idea that our ways of talking about technical artifacts and mobilizing them in discourse to perform actions are constitutive of the contemporary public sphere. Its originality lies in the articulation of two literatures, the social shaping of technology perspective and public sphere theory, to advance a theoretical framework that considers the discursive processes by which citizens constitute technical artifacts and the discursive practices by which they shape their collective future as inner connected. Through an argumentation analysis of a dialogue among technical designers, the paper identifies two key dimensions of the process by which artifacts are inscribed in public life. First, the artifacts appear in the interaction as a set of principles by which society and technology are, quite literally, held together in discourse. Second, these specific meanings ascribed to the artifacts are mobilized to authorize individual and collective actions."

The online dating process generally involves the construction of a profile detailing characteristics both offered and sought in a mate or date. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how these constructions reinforce and challenge traditional gender roles for men and women seeking heterosexual companionship. A content analysis of 80 profiles on the online dating web site Match.com provided results suggesting that although traditional roles were challenged in some respects, they tended to be reinforced and perpetuated through the construction of profiles on this particular web site."

Using evidence of rhetoric in activist press releases, company websites, protest paraphernalia, and reports in popular news media, I argue that the current CSR discourse constructs a public morality about corporations obligations to become agents of social justice. The analysis demonstrates that while the movements ideographs, image events, and appeals to ethos give the CSR activists a position moral strength, the rhetoric also creates a polarizing discourse that can erode activists legitimacy. This paper brings attention to the fact that CSR is not simply a fad but a long-term struggle to redefine the social position of business."

This study employs discourse analysis and ethnographic research at an indoor shopping mall in the North-Eastern United States to establish a deeper understanding of how consumers gain ideologies of gender identity through the mall as part of a disillusioned notion of the public sphere. It explores identity marketing and its role in reproducing hegemonic notions of gender through mall artifacts, semiotics, and communications technologies. In addition, it describes the implications of a nation comprised of citizens spending the bulk of their leisure time training for consumption."

Both of these initiatives frame the under-representation of girls and women in technology-related fields in unique ways. The NAE and GSA use media as a tool to reach girls and broaden awareness of the problem. This study analyzes how each program constructs notions of gender and technology, the programs they offer to achieve equality, the interventions they provide for parents and teachers, their use of media to raise awareness about this social problem, and their framing of the problem as a pressing social concern. I use content analysis of both organizations websites as well as participant-observation data from working with the NAE in the Summer 2004 as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow. I provide some insight into how program managers study and understand the need to increase girls participation with technology through observations from planning meetings of website designers, committee meetings with the websites advisory board, and strategies for finding funding for the site."

My task is to disrupt dominant narratives of postsocialist transformations that efface the politics of sexual difference. Based on data obtained via ethnographic research among Slovak lesbian and gay activists from five nongovernmental organizations, this presentation examines the dynamics and effects of dialogue between Slovak gay and lesbian activists, the EU Intergroup on Gay and Lesbian Rights, the ILGA-Europe and the Slovak government. In my analysis of this dialogue, I adopt Peter van Hams application of Foucaults conceptualization of transversal politics. This paper considers nascent lesbian and gay activism as contributing to the emerging visibility of sexual difference in contemporary Slovakia, simultaneously benefiting from and contesting the hegemonic and homogenizing processes of European integration and globalization."

Campaigns designed under the framework of the theory of reasoned action have focused on changing attitude and subjective norms, but we do not know the predictors to attitude and subjective norms. This study explored the important factors that influence smoking related attitudes and subjective norms in order to identify different conditions under which attitude and subjective norms can be changed and for recognizing other targets of persuasion. We used a quasi-experimental survey design (N = 260) to examine the mediating roles of attitude toward smoking and subjective norms on the observed effects of prior smoking experience, association with deviant peers, and risk and protective factors on adolescents smoking intentions respectively. Prior smoking experience, association with deviant peers, and risk and protective factors (especially, academic performance and frequency of school absences) predict behavior intention to smoke both directly and indirectly through the mediation of attitude and/or subjective norms. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."
2005-1761,Trends in American Collective Memory: The Lessons of Vietnam,Politics Over Space and Time,Political Communication,,,Paper,Trends in American Collective Memory: The Lessons of Vietnam,Politics Over Space and Time,"Many commentators perceive the Vietnam War as a turning point in American public opinion about a variety of issues such as support for defense spending, willingness to support military action overseas, and trust in government. However, no one has yet examined what public opinion polls reveal about how Americans remember Vietnam, how those memories have or have not changed over the past several decades, and how citizens have applied those memories to more recent U.S. military interventions. This paper describes what publicly available polling data reveal about trends in Americans collective memories of the Vietnam era on four dimensions: evaluations of the war itself, descriptions of the wars impact on domestic politics, assessments of the lessons of Vietnam, and comparisons between more recent U.S. military action and the Vietnam War. Available polling data suggest a collective quality to Americans memories of Vietnam but provide insufficient evidence to evaluate how rifts about the meaning of the war have or have not been resolved."

An analysis of the top ten movies from 1992 to 2002 and revenue data for 1991-2002 reveal that the most rapidly growing market is DVD distribution, which is affecting the video rental market significantly. However, the expansion in the DVD market not only affects the video market, which are direct substitutes, but also other distribution markets. The total market has been experiencing growth and with the advent of DVD diffusion, the market grew even faster during the past few years. The total growth in the market influenced the budgets of movies, which increased the box office revenues as well as other revenues streams. This is a traditional example of how new technologies increase consumption and spending on a media product and how that eventually increases the original budget resulting in the expansion of total markets for that product."
2005-1763,Trouble in a Geographically Distributed Virtual Network Organization: Organizing Tensions in Continental Direct Action Network,Communication Networks in Organizations,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Trouble in a Geographically Distributed Virtual Network Organization: Organizing Tensions in Continental Direct Action Network,Communication Networks in Organizations,"This study examines the impact of geographic dispersion and computer mediation on the organizing processes of a virtual network organization. Listserv and conference call records from the approximately two-year of existence of Continental Direct Action Network were thematically analyzed. A qualitative case study is used to examine how the virtualness of this organization impacted their perception of opportunity, balance of latency and mobilization, formation of a collective identity, and formation of affective bonds. This case study demonstrates some of the local/global tensions that may exist in the organizing processes of virtual social movement organizations. In addition, the organization had difficulty establishing a collective identity with new geographic localities. We suggest that new routes for informal communication between geographic localities may be necessary in order to enhance these processes and socialize new members into the network."

It combines an analysis of various theoretical and empirical perspectives with laypersons recollections of misunderstanding to develop a typology of misunderstandings. Building from a qualitative analysis of 73 participants experiences, the analysis suggests that misunderstandings reflect a variety of negative differences between relational partners. Thus, the notion of differencenamely a gap or chasm separating individualsunifies a variety of processes that prior scholarship left unconnected. Besides providing a base for uniting diverse forms of misunderstanding, the gulf or size of the difference is also used as a guide to distinguish between types of misunderstandings. Six types are described, namely Fundamental Misunderstanding, Motivated Misunderstanding, Surprising Difference, Illocutionary Difference, Misplanning, and Pragmatic Misunderstanding. The analysis contrasts the features of the various types of misunderstanding."

One of the newest reality shows discussed alternative religion in depth. Mad Mad House (MMH) debuted on the Sci-Fi channel in the spring of 2004. The premise was simple: ten ordinary Americans (guests) were to live in a mansion with five alternative religion practitioners (Alts) and witness/participate in their spiritual practices. The person who won the most trials created by the Alts would be declared the winner and receive $100,000.

Part of what makes MMH a particularly interesting site of study for examining the interplay between myth, ritual and mediated culture is that the show is the first of its kind to discuss religion openly. Additionally, the producers choice to focus on alternative religions offers an intriguing glimpse into how our culture may view these spiritual practices. In this paper, I examine the ways in which MMH presents alternative religious practices. I analyze the ways that the show presents these spiritual rituals and using Baudrillard's notion of hyperreality I examine the genre conventions that MMH employs. Additionally, I explore how groups who self-identified as members of these alternative religions viewed the shows depiction of their beliefs."

Development and Validation of a Multidimensional Scale.,"Trust, Responsibility and the Unaccepted: Issues of Ethics and Credibility in Journalism","In this paper, conceptualizations and operationalizations of trust in news media (including media credibility) are reviewed. The conclusion is that they not only lack a precise theoretical concept, but also neglect methodological issues such as validation in scale development. Thus, the purpose is to present the development and empirical validation of a multidimensional scale of trust in news media. In a first step, the model is tested on a representative sample (n = 487) via confirmatory factor analysis. After some modifications, the model is finally validated on another, independent sample (n = 727). These results confirm the hypothesis that trust in news media is a hierarchical factor (of second order) that consists of the four factors (of first order) trust in the selection of topics, trust in the selection of facts, trust in the accuracy of depictions and trust in journalistic assessment. This model is the first validated scale of trust in news media."
2005-1767,Trust in Online Advertising: Peripheral Factors Affecting Trust,Understanding Internet Advertisement,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Trust in Online Advertising: Peripheral Factors Affecting Trust,Understanding Internet Advertisement,"This is an exploratory investigation of the factors affecting trust in online ads. Investigators have repeatedly acknowledged the need for examining trust in online environments, particularly e-commerce, yet have overlooked the frequent antecedent of e-commerce, online advertising. The immense uncertainty associated with online interactions often forces users to rely on trust to facilitate online consumer interactions. The factors examined in this investigation (brand reputation, product familiarity, website reputation (vehicle effect), and the medium itself) were identified from investigations focusing on trust in e-commerce and traditional advertising. Results of this investigation reveal brand reputation to have a significant positive impact on online ad trust. Brand trust was also found to account for the vast majority of the explained variance in online ad trust. This was augmented by the interaction of all four factors as well as the interaction of brand reputation, product familiarity, and Internet experience."

One widely cited experiment on the topic (i.e., Kassin & Kiechel, 1996) has suggested that false confessions are easy to obtain and that the use of false incriminating evidence increases the likelihood of obtaining one. The present research attempted to replicate Kassin and Kiechels (1996) work using a different experimental task. In the present experiment, unlike Kassin and Kiechels (1996) study, the participants were completely certain that they were not responsible for what had happened, thereby providing a different context for testing the idea that false incriminating evidence increases the likelihood of obtaining a false confession. The results are discussed with respect to factors that may or may not increase individuals willingness to offer a false admission of guilt."

A multi-station, single market switch in frequencies serves as the focus of this case study analysis. While the enhancement or deterioration of signal strength is a primary contributor, stations whose formats had the greatest competition within the market, did the best job of product differentiation through station branding, and had highly accurate and accessible web sites were most effective in maintaining and, in some cases, increasing audience share."

The analysis allows us to identify the narrative resources of Israeli children as well as the cultural milieu in which their stories are constructed, providing a better understanding of the ways in which the children use these resources for meaning making. Our findings suggest that television is quite a major source for the co-construction of conversational narratives, and that with age, the identity of protagonists shifts from the fictional to the human.
Further, by focusing on one specific conversational story genre, i.e. television related pretend-play stories as a site for negotiation between popular culture and childhood culture, we try to understand what the uses of television content by the children can tell us about diverse sites of childhood development. Our findings corroborate the ""Stimulation hypotheses,"" (Valkenburg, 2000), elaborated in the study, by which T.V is shown as an active agent in promoting a range of competencies, including the development of imagination, literate language and social competencies."

Levels of uncertainty avoidance were calculated using Hofstedes (1994) Value Survey Module. Results showed that strong versus weak uncertainty avoiding culture members reported their intent to use more ritualistic and aggressive and fewer harmonious facework strategies during an embarrassing situation. This study highlighted the role of uncertainty avoidance in the study of facework. This investigation indicates the need for future research in receiver-based facework, especially the inverse relation of risk avoidance to uncertainty avoidance."

The paper mainly focuses on how the mediascapes and ethnoscapes (based on Appadurais five dimensional, non-isomorphic paths flow structure) interplay within the globalization framework related to diaspora cultural. It studies the programs (reading) provided to diaspora communities by domestic, global and diaspora media, and points out that most attempts are more surface layers than facilitating the culture identity or adaptation. Some case studies even prove that diaspora culture is just a new name brand for media industry or culture imperialism.

The paper concluded that true diaspora cultures are demanded by contemporary globalized environment, which is learning to listen to and speaking to others, rather than for or about others."

Even though websites have become an essential component of the weight loss related non-profit organizations and commercial business entities, very little academic attention has been given to the analysis of diet websites.
Among a total 890 available diet websites, randomly sampled 151 diet websites were content analyzed. To evaluate website efficiency and diet information composition, three categories of websites (information/infomercial/commercial websites) and six main components of diet websites (commercial information, commercial transaction, non-commercial information, navigation structures, interactive, and presentation style) were developed.
Content analysis results suggested that Infomercial diet website is a leading major form of diet websites followed by commercial and information diet websites. Also, categorical differences exist in diet website composition."

This study argued that the utilitarian and normative assumptions coexist as two dimensions with the addition of a collaborative dimension. Based on a three-dimensional perspective, this study advanced an additive model to predict organizational knowledge sharing. An empirical test was conducted to assess the model among a distributed sales force of a large manufacturing organization. Results showed both significant overall effects of the model and significant main effects by each of the three predictor variables derived from the three dimensions. A discussion of the findings addressed the implications of this study."

This paper looks at the various types of characters found in zombie movies over time to better understand how viewers might form positive or negative associations with those characters. Zombie films from the 1930s to the present were considered for this project. Characters have features that would seem to bring out both positive and negative associations with them, depending on individual differences in viewers. The results suggest that studies of viewers attachments to characters need to be more explicit about the types of characters, the situations they encounter, and how they react to other characters in the movie."

Then we tried to build a mathematical model based on CAS to explain the Dynamics of Guanxi Function and give a route to simulate by computers. In Addition, models of complex networks (such as Small-World or Scale-Free Networks) should be used in Chinese Guanxi Networks in the further research for the theoretical framework and application systems."

While they have provided powerful explanations for better understanding what happens in and around organizations, they still tend to have two major limitations. First, they tend to focus on one theory to explain what are the antecedents or consequences of network structures; second, they tend to be cross sectional rather than longitudinal in nature. This study begins to address these conceptual and methodological limitations. First, a multi-theory, multilevel approach (MTML) to the study of organizational networks is proposed. Second, SIENA is presented as a recently developed statistical approach that facilitates analysis of longitudinal social network data. Third, a study is described that analyzed the influence of 10 theoretical mechanisms on the evolution of an organizational communication network over a 2 year time period. Results demonstrate both endogenous and exogenous mechanisms are critical to understanding the evolution of networks. This approach to understanding network evolution provides a much clearer view of the underlying forces driving network change."

This voicing behavior can often play a crucial role in the effective functioning of organizations. Previous research regarding voice behaviors has concentrated on looking at antecedents of these behaviors; and very little research has focused on how employees can be effective while engaging in voice behaviors. This study analyzed how leader-member exchange (LMX) quality (high vs. low), message type (rational vs. ingratiation), and message sidedness (two sided non-refutational vs. one sided vs. two sided refutational) affect voice effectiveness. Two hundred and seventy nine participants read one of two scenarios and one of six suggestions; and then, answered questions about their perceptions of voice effectiveness and other induction checks. Results suggest that LMX quality makes a difference in judgements of voice effectiveness. Considerations for future research in voice effectiveness are discussed."

We unpack this conceptualization of virtuality, and argue that although each of these characteristics are related to the strength of social ties that bind the team together, they have independent effects and contribute to team outcomes through unique mechanisms. Specifically, based on in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of interviews with 177 members of 14 teams in a variety of industries, we find that geographic dispersion, electronic dependence, dynamic structure and national diversity are not highly intercorrelated, and that they have differential effects on the important team outcome of innovation. Further, in contrast to conventional wisdom that these elements are primarily a hindrance in teams, we find preliminary support that a supportive communication climate can help overcome many of the challenges they pose by creating more binding social ties among team members. We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and practice."

How does a translator justify rendering a gender-ambivalent first-person poetic voice into a clearly masculine, or feminine, persona? Consider Frosts Acquainted with the Night.

What is the difference between a woman who drops her eyes as she walks alone at night, and a man who does the same  and which best suits the poem? Moreover, should the translator be bound by the common denominator of grammatical limits  assuming a masculine translation for Frosts speaker  or does the ambivalence of English itself, and the absence of gender indicators, justify a parallel feminine rendering? As Frost never reveals the gender of his speaker, in English, I pose that both renderings are equally legitimate, and co-existing. How then, to reconcile this to a Russian text, which does not allow for such a duality?

While the question of the better translation is moot, it is legitimate to ask how separate masculine and feminine constructs are received. When the accepted, masculinized translation is presented to a Russian-speaking population, how is the poem received? When the feminine counterpart is presented? By measuring reactions, and comparing the assumptions that the readers make about the two versions of the text, we empower, instead of limit, the text."

Using an online survey data (N = 191), structural equation modeling analyses uncovered that perceived ease of use of the system had significant impacts on perceived usefulness as the TAM suggested. Unlike the original models expectation, however, it was found that the indirect effect of perceived usefulness on actual system use was directed not through behavioral intention to use the system but through evaluation of the system. This study also found that motivation to use the system played a significant role in affecting perceived usefulness, evaluation, and actual system use of the system. The implications for future study were also discussed."
2005-1784,User-generated Content on Mass Media Web Sites  Just a Kind of Interactivity or Something Completely Different?,tudies on Channel Complementarity,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,User-generated Content on Mass Media Web Sites  Just a Kind of Interactivity or Something Completely Different?,Studies on Channel Complementarity,"The newly discussed label user-generated content (UGC) stands for web site content produced by users. In contrast to private homepages or amateur web sites UGC is always situated on professional, commercial web sites, controlled and administered by professional providers and constitutes only one part of the whole content on such a site. A look at the concept of interactivity as well as on UGC reveals the relatedness of both concepts. The first part of this paper sketches differences and connections between interactivity and UGC. In a second step, we discuss the basic dimensions of UGC based on a qualitative yet non-systematic overview of existing mass media web sites. The basic aim of the paper is to develop a framework which shows basic differences and variants of mass media web sites integrating UGC and which may guide theoretical and empirical analyses in the future."

In order to better understand this issue, this paper will document the wider HIV/AIDS situation in China, paying particular attention to the ways in which China has been criticized by the international community for its treatment of the epidemic. A human rights framework allows for a careful analysis of the epidemic which takes into account the disproportionate way that HIV/AIDS affects marginalized groups around the world, and in the Xinjiang context as one which overwhelmingly affects the Uighur minority. Further, a feminist-inspired human rights framework provides an entry into gender-specific analyses of the epidemic. In a human rights approach to HIV/AIDS programming communication is understood to be both a right and a means to claiming other rights. As free communication is limited in totalitarian China, a human rights approach would open spaces within which communication would be possible, while paying particular attention to the gendered realities of HIV/AIDS."
2005-1802,Using Print Media to Motivate College Students to Visit a Website about Sensible Alcohol Use,Challenges of Using Interactive Communication Technologies for Health I,Health Communication,,,Paper,Using Print Media to Motivate College Students to Visit a Website about Sensible Alcohol Use,Challenges of Using Interactive Communication Technologies for Health I,"This paper discusses what type of message cues a mass media print advertisement should include if it aims to motivate college students to visit an educational website about alcohol. After elicitation of beliefs associated with student drinking, three advertisements were designed which included attention-getting and likeable message cues, a message tailored to the most important determinant of drinking, or both. Each contained a different URL. They were sent to 639 Dutch college students, who participated in a survey one week later. Measures were alcohol use, intention to drink moderately, recall and recognition of the advertisement, talking with others about the advertisement, attention to the advertisement, attitude towards the advertisement and the website, attitude and intention towards visiting the website, and actual visits to the website. Results indicate that including both attention-getting and likeable message cues and a message tailored to the most important determinant increases the advertisements effectiveness in motivating people to visit the campaign website."

Through an experiment conducted in Malaysia, one of the target areas of the videos, the authors tested if the viewers would be influenced by the major themes of the videos and see the United States as a land of opportunities, freedom of religion and respect for Muslims.

The results of the experiment show that the Shared Values videos are unlikely to achieve their designed purpose. Despite the fact that the videos featured Muslims to speak for the United States, they may not easily convince their Muslim viewers of the messages they were designed to deliver. Participants in the experiment who watched the Shared Values videos did not acquire a better perception of the United States and the Americans compared with viewers in the control groups who watched videos not designed for such purposes."

A growing body of literature in the field of public relations has delved into the topics of public diplomacy and civil society. Based on a critical analysis of U.S. pubic relations strategies in the Middle East, I argue that the traditional models of international public relations currently in circulation embody the one-way flow of communication embodied in early development communication scholarship. Drawing on a ritual model of communication, I articulate the need to apply a culture-centered approach in conducting international public relations."

While there is some debate as to what exactly constitutes posthuman, most seem to agree that this condition is either coming soon or already here. In this paper I claim that popular notions of technological futures can help us to better understand the posthuman. To do this, I examine common characteristics of Utopian and Dystopian narratives and use them to develop master narratives for the each genre. Following the descriptions of those narratives, I examine two popular Science Fiction film examples of the proposed master narratives. Using those two analyses as a guide, I hope to examine what Utopian and Dystopian narratives may have to say about our technological, posthuman future."

Yet, when searching on-line databases for texts, how do we know if our search phrases are finding the texts that we seek? Applying a procedure standard to the information sciences, we introduce a method to measure the quality of a search phrase according to two criteria: its ability to accurately call up items of interest, and to avoid extraneous ones. Two measures correspond to these two criteria: recall and precision. Recall and precision are both proportions relating to the number of relevant stories returned by a search phrase. Recall is the proportion of relevant items in the database that the search term calls up (specifying the relevant items missed by the search). It is defined as the number of relevant items returned by a search phrase divided by the total relevant records in the database. Precision is the proportion of the results of a search that are relevant (specifying the extraneous portion of the search). It is defined as the number of relevant items divided by the total number of items returned in a specific search. We present a detailed description of the evaluation procedure, offer an example of its use assessing an on-line search for news reports about cancer, and discuss limitations of the procedure and further potential uses."

This paper investigates the cultural meanings of the professional middle class in relation to, and conflicting with, the working class by tracing discourses illustrated in a popular film. Drawn from several notions of social class by social thinkers, such as Marx, Weber, Giddens, and Bourdieu, this study analyzes discourses of the movie White Palace as cultural texts and recognizes the complexity and the diversity of ways to negotiate distinct tastes of class and class conflicts. While movies sincerely dealing with class issues are scarce, a more dynamic and enriched approach to understanding the cultural meanings of the professional middle class are beneficial and to be encouraged."
2005-1808,Victims and Intruders in the Belgian Press Coverage of the Asylum Issue,News Coverage of Politics,Political Communication,,,Paper,Victims and Intruders in the Belgian Press Coverage of the Asylum Issue,News Coverage of Politics,"In this article an empirically oriented conceptualization of frames is developed, using the issue of asylum and illegal immigration in the Belgian press as a test case. The methodological focus of this study is on the question of how these frames can be detected in the coverage. How can they be defined sharply and independently of the researchers perspective, knowing that the naming of frames in itself already involves a kind of framing? Two frames are constructed and deductively measured by a content analysis: on the one hand, asylum-seekers are innocent victims and, on the other hand, asylum-seekers are intruders. In a second phase, this article examines to what extent eight Belgian newspapers used these two frames to cover the issue of asylum. A homogeneity analysis by means of HOMALS is introduced in the framing research. It turns out to be a fruitful way to establish the frames in the news more precisely. The construction of indices made it possible to explore the evolution of the use of frames over time. Surprisingly, the Christmas mood was a factor that caused a frame-shift and it even lead to a media hype."

Drawing on theory about the effects of temporal coordination, we hypothesized that even a small delay in visual and auditory feedback through a video communication system could produce changes in emotion and communication outcomes, and that this effect is moderated by an individuals level of involvement while performing the task. Our operationalization of involvement accounted for situational, enduring, rational, and affective types of involvement. We also explored the effect of one, two, and four second delays on the outcome variables. Results showed that, when discussing political topics, highly involved individuals experienced significantly less communication satisfaction and positive emotion in the delay condition, and that this effect was stronger with longer delays. Lowly involved individuals were generally less affected by the delay, although they did report increased negative emotion. Implications for this construction of involvement are discussed."
2005-1810,Video Rental Choices: Mood Management on a Saturday Night,tudies in Entertainment,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Video Rental Choices: Mood Management on a Saturday Night,Studies in Entertainment,"Utilizing mood management theory (Zillmann, 1988) and its extension, mood adjustment theory (Knobloch, 2003), we recruited participants who were entering a video rental store in order to assess possible links between mood and video choice. This was done in order to maximize external validity in examining the relationship between mood and media choice. Participants reported on their current mood before entering the store; upon exiting they reported on their rental choices. Overall, aspects of the viewing situation (alone vs. with others), mood and to some extent viewers activities before and after viewing were related to video choice but not always in the ways we had predicted. In general, those who felt afraid, with perhaps an excess of stress or arousal chose more comedies, those who felt bored chose fewer dramas and those who felt energetic chose more action/adventure movies. In addition, those who felt sad chose more - not fewer- dramas. Rather, sad people seemed to gravitate to serious films. In terms of mood adjustment theory, which makes claims about intended activities after viewing, these data suggest that those who intend to use media after watching the movie/s chose fewer action/adventure movies; whereas those who intended to do chores chose dramas. Theoretical implications are discussed."

This 2x2 experiment compares group (2 person) versus alone viewer emotional reactions watching either a linear or an interactive version of a 7 minute digital video narrative, Modern Cinderella. Eighty subjects were randomly assigned to each of the four conditions. Enjoyment, story involvement, and arousal were not different across conditions. The interactive version sparked more viewer curiosity, more laughing out loud, and more discussion than the linear version. Those who experienced the interactive version were enthusiastic about being able to make choices. Interactive narratives appear to be fall in between high and low involvement. Group viewing of interactive narrative was different than alone viewing. Those watching with others thought less carefully about the choices and paid less attention. Alone viewers were the most curious."

Media involving virtual action space, including video games and virtual reality, have raised concerns about after-effects. This study examines the factors influencing both participant responses to motion in virtual action space and their outcomes. Researchers point to spatial orientation as well as emotion and simulation symptoms as factors in post-test performance. Perception and media theorists agree that individuals respond to mediated spatial information in much the same way as the natural environment. Results identify real-life and media response effects on spatial, perceptual and balance measures and point to the essential role of spatial orientation in participant responses to virtual action space."

Over the course of one month, participants in an online game changed their perceptions of real-world dangers. However, these dangers only corresponded to events and situations found in the game world, not other real-world crimes. This targeted finding is at odds with the broader spreading activation postulated by some cultivation researchers. The results, their implications for theory, and the study of games are discussed."

Research in virtual reference service (VRS) and client/librarian behavior is just beginning with a primary focus on task issues of accuracy and efficiency. This study is the first to apply communication theory to an exploration of relational (socioemotional) aspects of chat services. It reports results from a pilot study followed by an analysis of 245 randomly selected anonymous transcripts from a statewide chat reference service. Transcripts underwent in-depth qualitative content analysis. Results revealed that interpersonal skills important to FtF reference success are present (although modified) in VRS. These include: techniques for rapport building, compensation for lack of nonverbal cues, strategies for relationship development, evidence of deference and respect, face-saving tactics, greeting and closing rituals. Results also identified interpersonal communication dynamics present in the chat reference environment, differences in client vs. librarian patterns, and compensation strategies for lack of nonverbal communication."
2005-1815,Visions and Realities. Discourse in a Strategy Communication Process,Discourse and Strategic Communication,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Visions and Realities. Discourse in a Strategy Communication Process,Discourse and Strategic Communication,"This paper presents a longitudinal qualitative study of communication about strategy, encompassing vision, strategic objectives and common values in a company. Communication followed a top-down process from CEO down the hierarchy of managers to employees. A combination of methods: interviews, observations and discourse analysis, was used to study important factors influencing the strategy communication process. The analysis demonstrates how visions formulated by top managers met different realities constructed by subordinate managers. Discourse dimensions of framing, footing and face reveal the importance of individual experience, attitudes, and power to sensemaking in the strategy communication process. Accordingly, this method is considered to enhance analyses of sensemaking and communication problems in organizations."

First, attention is paid to the cultural implications of employing divergent visual and verbal design elements in a health message. While pictorial information may serve a crucial role in intercultural and development communication and education, it is a mistake to think that pictorial information is easily comprehensible and invariably effective. Pictorial materials are, often in unacknowledged ways, very much culturally coded and their uses, too, can be highly culturally specific. Following this general discussion of the cultural coding of images and visual traits, a number of health promotion posters are being analysed on the basis of research findings and principles of message design in a multicultural context. Finally, a visual essay approach is taken to comment on roadside media - billboards and alternative media - encountered in the Free State and Lesotho."

Both are visual disciplines,as cultural geography looks at the world as a visual text, charged with cultural value, and as photography is interpretive as well.The meeting between the rwo disciplines gave birth to fertile research, of combined quantitative and qualitative methodology into National Identity construction. That was created through a coherent infra-structure of landscape photography ,into which the system of production and the themes incorporated for turning the neutral ""space"" into a well defined ""place"",a Jewish Homeland with an elitist nucleus of most photographed places and motifs,versus far-away margins or exckuded places and motifs."
2005-1818,Visual Culture in Indian Politics:The Gaudy Billboard as Political Communication,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,Political Communication,,,Paper,Visual Culture in Indian Politics:The Gaudy Billboard as Political Communication,Political Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,"The dominance of the visual, or the visible, in all aspects of contemporary social and political life, is a recognized aspect of communication research. In a developing country such as India, boasting the worlds largest democracy, yet carrying the multiple burdens of poverty, under-development and illiteracy, the particular role played by the visual and the visible in political communication is doubly significant. In order to reach the huge swathes of the rural and the illiterate and to mitigate the barriers created by the complex linguistic diversity of the country, politicians in India have always relied on the visual to carry their messages to voters. Billboards, cutouts and posters are the most popular form of political campaigning in India, even in this era of digital technology, internet advertising and text messaging. But an academic study of this phenomenon, however seems to have eluded the proper attention of political communication research.
The purpose of this paper is to explore the tradition of billboard and poster campaigns in India as a political and propagandistic medium, analyze the social, cultural and artistic traditions of India that are reflected through them, and demonstrate the way in which their pre-eminence in Indian political life represents a unique tradition of political communication that is grounded in the nations culture and socio-political development."

This paper examines the historical precursors to that method. They are represented by the pictorial diagrams found in popular, illustrated almanacs published from the end of the nineteenth century and after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, reflecting an early prototype for visualization of statistics, a regime of information established in the nineteenth century as a result of modernization processes and the need of the modern nation state to control and manage its population. This method of visualization also reflects the current concerns for managing public opinion. Although the Isotype studio perfected the convention of signs and their use for presenting social and economic structures, the popular almanacs distributed widely throughout the Habsburg Empire and based on earlier forms of anthropomorphic visual representation of abstract concepts and quantity images, established comparable methods of representation for disseminating widely the information about the social, political, and economic conditions of the contemporary world. They were used for shaping and informing public opinion in a society with low literacy levels and linguistically differentiated population. The theoretical and methodological basis for analysis are information science and visualization research, interpreted in the macro-social and historical context in which these diagrams were circulated."

This paper explicates modality-induced salience in terms of vividness and resulting social presence, and explains modalitys effect as resulting from the ability of social presence to facilitate source-related heuristic processing. Two models predicted that vivid media will increase social presence and subsequent information processing styles (either heuristic or systematic) which shape attitudes differentially as a function of source likeability. An experiment manipulated media vividness (print, small screen, medium screen, large screen) and source likeability (liked, disliked). The results suggest that more vivid technology can increase social presence, which affects both heuristic and systematic processing shaping attitude. Contrasting paths for liked and disliked source models indicate that heuristic and systematic processing were interwoven, and this suggests that both processing styles can operate simultaneously to effect attitude."

In so doing, it is argued that Levine et al.s (2003) critique of the validity of self-construal misidentifies the causes of the problems found in the extant self-construal scales. The vicissitudes of self-construals are reviewed to illustrate the constructs historical descent in communication and sociocultural psychology studies over the past 15 years. Several underlying properties and the hierarchical structure of interdependent self-construals are also highlighted. In light of this rearticulation, it is argued that an individual who generally endorses an interdependent-self view has a broad latitude of selfhood and is able to instantiate the self amorphously in the given contexts to the extent of that latitude. Elaborated implications for scale improvement and suggestions for future research in self-construal and/or communication studies are also presented."
2005-1822,War as a Failed Ritual Sacrifice from Vietnam to Iraq,Bodies/Meanings,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,War as a Failed Ritual Sacrifice from Vietnam to Iraq,Bodies/Meanings,"Modern collective rituals are deeply intertwined with the facts of the world. For the imagined community that acts in history, it is less the fine-grained particulars of policy and information that govern our understanding of ourselves at critical moments than more magically perceived threats to group unity. Modern U.S. wars are patterned ritual sacrifices as well as tactical political undertakings, but only a definitive set of conditions, rarely fulfilled, makes war a unifying ritual. Using Marvin and Ingles (1999) model of war as sacrificial ritual of communication, I examine the ritual failure of American involvement in Iraq as an extension of the unresolved sacrifice of Vietnam. Beginning with Sept. 11, my analysis applies this model to the American invasion of Iraq and its elaboration in the 2004 presidential campaign."

Many students view television news as a glamorous industry where the anchor is the star. Some young journalists quickly become disillusioned by the long hours, low pay, and formulaic story assignments.
Through interviews, this study found students divided into two camps: those who perceived broadcast journalists as watchdogs or public servants and those who perceived broadcast journalists as actors or celebrities. Direct experiences, such as classes and internships, showed little effect on student perception. Analysis did reveal, however, a relationship between the types of news programs students said they regularly watched, and their perception of the television news profession."

J.J. Abrams, the show runner for a US program called ""Alias"" is a confessed board watcher: """"If the Internet is your audience, TV is quite like a play,"" he observed. ""Movies are a done deal -- there's no give and take -- but in a play, you listen to the applause, the missing laughs, the boos. It's the same with the Internet. If you ignore that sort of response, you probably shouldn't be working in TV right now."" Abram's observation highlights the expectations of an audience immersed in an increasingly interactive media environment, one in which they are provided with proliferating avenues for talking back to the tube, whether by kicking cast members off reality shows, creating fan sites or venting on to the boards. This paper explores the way in which interactivity doubles as a form of value-enhancing labor for television producers in two ways: by allowing fans to take on part of the work of making a show entertaining, and by providing instant feedback to producers. Based on interviews and surveys of contributors to TelevisionWitoutPity.com and on interviews with producers who frequent the site, the paper explores the two sides of interactivity: the promise of shared control, and the ability to offload some of the labor of market research on to viewers."

This paper overviews its theory and then explores ways it can add layers of complexity to our second wave understanding of how female identity is constructed in a television text and in talk about Dawsons Creek by female viewers. It is part of a larger study that seeks not only to harness third wave feminism, but to compare current data taken from high school and college aged viewers of Dawsons Creek with data collected a decade earlier from viewers of Beverly Hills, 90210."

Three Hofstedes (1991) national culture dimensions, Power Distance, Individualism, and Confucian Dynamics, are tested, confirmed, and critiqued. Web sites are studied as artifacts, which represent organizational culture rather than communication medium, in this study. The analysis is conducted on both verbal units (web content) and non-verbal units (photos, banners, animations, colors, logos, etc.) of the web sites. This study has generated thoughts and reflections on various issues assessed in this exploratory study, such as validation and variation of Hofstedes research in a new context (web site), relationship between national culture and organizational culture, joint ventures, and research methodology on web site. Limitations, implications, and future directions of research are discussed at last."

This paper explores the cross-cultural applicability the dialectic perspective to interpersonal relationship focusing on friendship. The discussion starts with conceptualization, interpreting and elaborating friendship dialectics in terms of the Chinese cultural tradition. A preliminary test of conceptualization follows in report of an interview study of young people in Hong Kong. Qualitative analyses confirm the cross-cultural applicability of friendship dialects in a Chinese society."

The participants frequently approached by random strangers and questioned about their race, articulate how they interpret identity questions. The What are you? phenomenon that they routinely experience, is understudied in the fields of interpersonal communication, sociology and psychology. Social Legitimacy is considered in relation to acceptance of racial identities when bodily appearance is not consistent with expectations. The participants experiences suggest that many people still rely on appearance as a signifier of race despite the growing multiracial population in the U.S. This study raises questions for future research that should consider how changing demographics in the U.S. might influence perceptions of bodily appearance in conjuncture with the construct of race."

There has been a significant change in news coverage, news topics and news sources of the headlines and photographs of the Hattiesburg American after its acquisition by Gannett. This suggests that the ownership may affect the news content, i.e. news coverage, news topics and news sources and calls for further research. Practically, the findings indicate that the management strategies of Gannett may not be effective in association with the circulation decrease."

Empirical Examination of Lock-In Occurring on an Individual Level in Instant Messaging Use,Instant Messaging Usage,"Drawing upon the learning theory of self-efficacy as well as economic theories of switching costs, this study empirically examines various predictors of instant messenger switching cost and lock-in. More specifically, the purpose of this study is to evaluate how well the level of lock-in occurring on an individual level in instant messaging use is predicted by a set of multiple independent variables including computer self-efficacy, instant messenger self-efficacy, perceived switching cost, perceived inconvenience of non-interoperability of instant messaging, and positive evaluation of the instant messaging an individual is currently using. The results of hierarchical multiple regression and path analyses showed that (1) perceived inconvenience of non-interoperable nature of instant messaging services mediated the effects computer self-efficacy, and prior experience with alternative instant messenger providers have on instant messenger switching cost; (2) instant messaging self-efficacy mediated the effects year of instant messenger use, frequency of instant messenger use have on positive evaluation of the currently used instant messenger; (3) switching cost significantly predicted lock-in, whereas positive evaluation of the incumbent service failed to predict lock-in. Thus, path analyses revealed the dynamics of instant messenger switching cost and lock-in. Based on the findings, theoretical contributions and ecological relevance of this study to instant messenger market will be discussed."

Comparing Israeli Public and Journalists' Perspectives,"Professional Values in Journalism: Ideology, Competition and Public Service",Journalism Studies,,,Paper,What is Good Journalism? Comparing Israeli Public and Journalists' Perspectives,"Professional Values in Journalism: Ideology, Competition and Public Service","Journalists are often depicted as ""watchdogs"" or ""advocates."" Both metaphors imply that journalists should operate on behalf of the public, provide it with information necessary for democratic decision-making, and deal with issues that the public cares about. The positioning of public service as a core professional journalistic value raises the question of the correspondence between what the journalists and the public perceive as good and bad journalism. A public service journalistic orientation implies that journalists and audiences ought to agree on the essence of the journalistic mission, or at least that the journalists and the public should be aware of each side's beliefs and expectations.
In this study, a sample of Israeli journalists and a sample of the Israeli public were asked a series of questions about the core goals, values and practices of journalism. The results of the two surveys suggest four major findings: first, Israeli journalists have a clear, almost uniform perception of what constitutes worthy journalism. Second, Israeli journalists and the Israeli public differ in the degrees of significance they assign to various journalistic norms and practices. For instance, while journalists grade the interpretation of news as more important than neutral reporting, the audience prefers objectivity and neutrality over interpretation. Third, the Israeli public is slightly more positive in its overall assessment of the operation of Israeli media in comparison to the journalists. Finally, even though the two general assessments are fairly close in their numerical values, they are constituted by different or even opposing components."

2005-1833,What is the Relationship between Internet Use and Political Efficacy in China?,The Internet as Mobilizer,Political Communication,,,Paper,What is the Relationship between Internet Use and Political Efficacy in China?,The Internet as Mobilizer,"The major goal of this article is to examine the relationship between political efficacy and Internet use for politics. To answer this question, a secondary analysis of the data from a survey in China in 2000 is conducted. The findings are also compared with those found in the U.S. to explore the impact of political system on this relationship. This paper provides analysis and empirical data for three aspects. First, there is a reciprocal relationship between political efficacy and Internet use for politics in which the latter is likely to be the principle causal factor. Second, in non-democratic countries, there is no significant difference between internal and external efficacy, at least as measured in this Chinese survey. Voluntarism and the potential influence of political action are two important dimensions conditioning the relationship between political efficacy and political participation. Finally, with the low degree of Internet penetration in China, Internet access and reading online news cannot improve political efficacy, while attending online discussions of public affairs can increase the political efficacy of Internet users. In addition, this kind of political participation probably couldnt encourage people to attend other kinds of political actions, especially those with risks."

A Test of Four Theoretically-Driven Approaches,Theoretical and Methodological Issues in Health Message Design,"What makes an effective public service announcement? This question was addressed in the context of safer sex using a large random sample of heterosexually active young adults (N=1,463). Participants watched five 30-second safer sex PSAs on a laptop computer and answered a number of questions about their perceived effectiveness. Four theoretically-driven approaches to understanding perceived message effectiveness were then tested individually and collectively: (1) a cognitive approach, (2) an affective approach, (3) a personal utility approach, and (4) a perceived message sensation value (PMSV) approach. In multiple regressions predicting perceived message effectiveness, and controlling for demographic, individual difference, and sexual context variables, personal utility (mean β=.27) and PMSV (mean β=.26) were found to be the strongest predictors, followed by cognitive reaction (mean β=.18) and affective reaction (mean β=.09). The regressions explained, on average, 49% of the variance in perceived message effectiveness (R2=.49). Differences in high versus low sensation-seeking individuals were not found. Results indicate the importance of designing PSAs that are viewed as relevant by the target audience (personal utility) and which contain content and formal features that increase attention to and persuasiveness of the messages (PMSV). Implications of these results are discussed, and directions for future research are offered."

This study, coupled with qualitative data, surveys the perceptions of the nations news decision-makers. It examines what mattered the most to them in embedded journalism. Support was found for a matrix of factors affecting embedded journalism practice, and particularly individual level of factors, i.e., professional background, individual characteristics, professional roles, routine practices, even during war time. National news sources, particularly, newspapers, and affiliate news outlets and the Associated Press were perceived to be the prominent players. Respondents considered accuracy, reliability and fairness as significant in the credibility of embedded news reports. This study suggests an important consideration for embedded journalists reporting and offers an insight for public information officials in their strategic approach to embedded journalists."

Results reveal photojournalists believe their work can have powerful effects on the public under certain circumstances. Overall, respondents were more likely to rate visuals from 9/11 to be more powerful than visuals from the Afghan War. Further, data analysis offers support for the sociology of news perspective. Findings indicate homogeneous attitudes toward the impact of visual messages on the public."

In this experimental study we explore the effect of increasing the number of television channels on viewers' selection of news programming. Three groups of subjects were randomly assigned to conditions of 2-channels, 5-channels, or 25-channels and offered a hypothetical evening's viewing among popular news and entertainment programs. In the 5 and 25 channel conditions the proportion of news and entertainment channels was held constant, in order to study whether merely increasing the number of channels affects viewing choice. The results indicate that as the number of channels increases the choosing of news programs decreases. Furthermore, we find that an increase in channels does not lead to ""shopping around"" among genres, but rather to greater rigidity of viewing choices. Consistent with recent research in social psychology, our findings question whether more choice is ""good"" for viewers, the media system, or democracy."

It includes a review of the literature and excerpts from interviews with women working in Public Relations and communications management in the U. S. Auto Industry. Women in this study recognized Queen Bees in their own work environments and when asked how they think womens behavior contributes to this problem, they offered a number of explanations: Queen Bees are created as a result of competition within the workplace, tokenism, and the adaptive behavior of women who enter these traditionally male roles. The women suggested that women look to each other to help solve this problem; they urged senior women to mentor their junior colleagues, and suggested women develop their ownGood Old Girlnetworks."

This experimental study examined the influence of different motivational factors on viewers emotional responses to TV news stories about out-group members. Sixty college students viewed a series of Hispanic news stories that were positive or negative in valence and high or low in arousal. In general, the study found a) a significant influence of ethnic identity in that high identifiers indicated in-group serving attitudes more than did low identifiers; b) little influence of the implicit association (IAT) on viewers emotions; and c) some mixed findings generated with the MCPRS factor."

It notes first that there are many, contradictory, theories of globalization, and that many of them are presented without concrete evidential support. In order to examine this diversity, it proposes a range of claims within which the main theories fall. It then considers what kinds of evidence might be used to test these claims, and attempts to gather this material. In practice, it turns out that none of the claims made by leading theories are true, in the sense that they do not correspond to the evidence. It is further noted that in pursuing these claims, the leading theorists ignore major aspects of contemporary communication. It is concluded that the theory of globalization, at least as articulated by its major proponents, is not adequate to guide our understanding of contemporary reality, and that it is necessary to examine other approaches in order to do so."

Modern differentiated societies rely on mass-mediated news to communicate these multiple viewpoints on a scope and scale that reaches the citizenry. Whether individuals pursue information on others political preferences, however, is another matter. While some are motivated to seek as much information possible, others either seek information that supports their own preference, or shun information altogether. This differential pattern of awareness has implications for peoples assessment of collective preferences. I develop and test a motivated reasoning (MR) model that explicates the relationship between accuracy goals (to reach correct conclusion) and directional goals (to reach preferred conclusion). Predictions regarding perceptions of collective preferences are tested using a large-scale probability-sample survey and experimental group data. Results show that MR (1) is a significant predictor of the ability to generate counter-attitudinal messages, i.e., reasoning a political opponents point of view, (2) affects perceptions of public opinion--some people systematically overestimate support for their own opinion, whereas others systematically underestimate support. These predictions held for estimates of national-level opinion as well as estimates of the modal leaning in discussion groups. Implications of these findings for the spiral of silence theory are discussed. The paper concludes with a normative reflection on the attainability of considered public opinion."

To date, no literature is available on intercultural conflicts between Chinese managers and Western subordinates. This study investigates conflict situation involving Chinese managers with Westerner as subordinates. Through field observation in a multinational company and in-depth interviews with a diverse group of Chinese managers and Western employees, this study found that Chinese managers tended to switch their conflict strategies overtimes while Western subordinates kept their confrontational strategy rather consistently even they were at a lower organizational status. Face was found an important influencing factor on choice of conflict strategy by Chinese but Westerners felt severity of conflicts, credibility and inter-relation were most influencing factors. This study of intercultural conflicts in the superior-subordinate relationship confirms some cultural patterns as well as adaptability in the context."

Findings suggest that the meaning of diversity is characterized by three types of oppositions within the U.S. American consciousness: opposing ideologies, dialectical tensions, and contradictions between experience and the language used to talk about it, especially in regard to racial identity. These oppositions reveal both a cultural psychosis in regard to race and an opportunity for social change through metacommunication."

Government agencies have a high level of responsibility to communicate accurately and completely with the public during a crisis situation. However, one element that is consistently missing from research on crisis communication planning is the climate of public opinion. The literature invariably considers the internal needs of an organization, but does not address the external needs of the public during a crisis. The issue-attention cycle, a theory originated in 1972 by Anthony Downs, pays close attention to the publics level of attentiveness to an issue and defines a crisis based upon the publics perception. The authors resulting model blends the five stages of the issue-attention cycle with a six-stage process of crisis communication planning in the public sector."
2005-1859,When Long-distance Dating Partners Become Geographically Close,Closing the Divide: Interpersonal Communication in Long Distance Relationships,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,When Long-distance Dating Partners Become Geographically Close,Closing the Divide: Interpersonal Communication in Long Distance Relationships,"This research examined the transition from a long-distance dating relationship (LDDR) to a geographically close dating relationship (GCDR), positive attributes of LDDRs, and differences between individuals who terminated their relationships and those who continued their relationships. Findings revealed that maintenance of a relationship during separation does not ensure relational continuation upon (re)union. The transition from distance to proximity involves unanticipated changes, including the discovery of negative and positive partner attributes, a loss of autonomy, time management difficulties, and relational escalation or de-escalation. Desirable aspects of LDDRs included autonomy, easier time management, and feelings that the distance fostered relational closeness and excitement or novelty. Termination was linked to the changes individuals experienced upon becoming proximal. Pragmatically, it is suggested that individuals in LDDRs should expend greater efforts to increase partner and relational knowledge in order to assess their relationships and anticipate and prepare for the probable changes brought about by increased proximity."

Results revealed that (a) high rationals were more likely than low rationals to accept the partners opinion buttressed by real than placebic information, (b) people exhibited greater mindfulness when the partners self-confidence manifested the highest ambiguity, and (c) female-charactered partners elicited greater mindfulness than did the male-charactered counterparts, but only among men. By employing more direct measures of information processing, reaction time and perceived validity of the partners claims, Study 2 confirmed that differential conformity to real and placebic information stemmed from mindful message encoding."

The present study investigates this phenomenon by looking at the widely-viewed anti-President George W. Bush documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. Using survey data gathered from a national sample of United States residents before and after the opening of Fahrenheit 9/11, this study investigates the degree of selective exposure and the potential media effects occurring as a result of exposure to the film. There is clear evidence that selective exposure occurred  the audience for the film held significantly more negative attitudes toward President George W. Bush prior to viewing. This study also suggests that those who viewed the movie had significantly more negative opinions of Bush compared to those who intended to view the film, even after controlling for demographic, political, and media use differences between the groups. Results also suggest that political discussion with friends and family did not moderate or enhance the influence of the movie."

This study analyzes the entire length of the first 24 hours of coverage of 9/11 by three television networks  CNN, NBC and CBS  to study patterns of sourcing by journalists on the basis of gender and race. The results show an overwhelming preference for male sources over female. The number of female sources came close to half of the number of male sources only when women were non-authoritative sources, such as bystanders/eyewitnesses at Ground Zero. A similar bias was found in favor of white sources as compared to non-whites. African American sources were significantly low in number and Hispanic sources were almost absent, despite the diverse make-up of the population of NYC. Also, the gender or race of the reporter had no impact on the gender or race of the sources they approached."

Medical, health, or science journalists were asked to rate 30 different organizations on their credibilitytrustworthiness, accuracy, fairness, and bias. The study also involved a content analysis of 883 news stories to rate how the news content portrayed those 30 organizations in terms of five indicators of news coverage. The findings suggest that source credibility is related to the quality aspect of news coverage, such as regular and positive coverage, whereas it is not related to the amount of news coverage."

Furthermore, official sources are often regarded as more powerful than journalists in this symbiotic relationship. However, most of the research referred to in the international literature is done in the United States or Britain. Since the relationship between journalists and their sources can be expected to be highly influenced by the media system as well as the political system, history and culture, the question regarding who leads the tango  journalists or their political sources  needs to be asked in more countries than those usually referred to.
Thus, this paper examines the relationship between journalists and their political sources in Sweden at the time of the National Election in 2002. In doing that, it also divides the question about who leads the tango  journalists or their political sources  into two questions: 1) do journalists or their political sources have the power over the process of news making, and 2) do journalists or their political sources have the power over the content of news stories? The results show the importance of making a distincion between those two aspects. They also show that in the Swedish context, it is the journalists and not their political sources that most of the time lead the tango."

An Exploratory Study,Psychological Dimensions of Online Interactions and Attitudes,"Although Internet dating has become a pervasive phenomenon, we know little about the characteristics of singles looking for (a) for casual dates or (b) romantic relationships online. Drawing on a survey among 330 single Internet users, we found that people's age (inverted U-shape), the temporal distance since the latest romantic break-up, and an interaction between gender and sexual orientation explained how often people looked for dates on the Internet. The frequency with which people looked for romance on the Internet was predicted by age (inverted U-shape), the chance of meeting a partner in one's social environment, the temporal distance since the latest romantic break-up, the cognitive accessibility of the latest partner, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiousness. Our findings suggest that, for a considerable proportion of singles, Internet dating presents a possibility to cope with problems that result either from coming to terms with previous relationships or establishing new ones."

However, over three million Americans still lack telephone access. We study two specific government subsidy schemes for the economically disadvantaged - Lifeline and Linkup, and statistically evaluate their effect on telephone penetration in the United States. We construct regression models uniquely combining the data collected from the US Census and released to us by the FCC. Our analysis sheds light on the impact of Lifeline and Link-Up with other societal attributes like income, education, race, marital status and age. We find that in the case of Lifeline, a 1% increase in the amount support would cause a increase 0.23% percent increase in the percent of people in the state on Lifeline. Thus, in any average state the increase in subsidy would enable approximately 10,000 more people to gain regular access to a telephone. Furthermore, we suggest why these schemes in their current state have only limited effects and provide policy recommendations on how to ameliorate the situation of the disconnected Americans."

Using hegemony as a theoretical framework and relying on previous research reporting gender inequities in media coverage of sport, we predicted that despite a fairly equitable presence in the Olympic Games, coverage of female athletes and athletics on the web would still tend to emphasize sexual difference. Our findings support the conclusion in that male athletes were covered more frequently in visual and textual form; male athletes were seen much more frequently in contact or strength sports; and male athletes were photographed more frequently using an upward camera angle rather than a downward camera angle. This and other findings are discussed."

Characters, Personality, and Relationships","Disposition theory explains how perceptions of characters as favorable or unfavorable and the fulfillment of expected narrative structures play a role in a viewers overall enjoyment of media. However, predicting prolonged viewing and keeping viewers attentive to a particular program may be attributed to psychological responses, such as fear, anxiety, and hope, or more specifically suspense. This study examines viewers affective dispositions toward characters and anticipation of outcomes for characters on perceptions of suspense and interest in continual viewing of the television series, ""Survivor."" An online questionnaire (N=250) is currently being administered each week for a 14-week period. Following the broadcast of each episode of ""Survivor,"" participants report whether they viewed the episode, and if so, perceptions of characters in terms of their of likeability, honesty, and skill. Additional ratings include expectations of character outcome, evoked suspense, and anticipation of viewing the next episode. This research explores how narrative structures which promote a variety of character outcomes and contain elements which drive perceptions of suspense may contribute to the enjoyment and sustained viewership of entertainment programming."

Data from 53 articles published in 27 journals met criteria for the study. Fifty-five independent effect sizes coded from samples totaling N=18,529 were meta-analyzed. Results indicated that the mean sample-size weighted effect size of the SSC-condom use relation was r=.22. A number of conceptual variables moderated this relationship, while methodological moderators tended to be unrelated to effect size. Implications for the future study of safer sexual communication as well as the importance of emphasizing communication skills in HIV preventive interventions are discussed."

Four motives (convenience, socialization, entertainment/diversion, and information) and two factors (information seeking and participation) in peripheral activities besides a movie watching behavior were discovered via factor analysis. The relationship between motives and movie watching behaviors showed that in general, while convenience motive was the strongest predictor of Internet movie watching behavior, socialization was a stronger predictor of the frequency of the behavior."

Participants (N = 43) maintained a log of their leisure time activities twice a day for a week. In addition to reporting on their leisure time activities, participants also completed demographics and measures of interpersonal needs, satisfaction with leisure activities and positive and negative mood. Hierarchical linear modeling approach was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Results indicated that individuals high in need for inclusion engaged in more people-centered activities and that needs for control and affection interacted with the type of activity to impact satisfaction and positive and negative mood. Implications of the study findings are discussed in terms of theory and practice."

As community-based learning generally requires members voluntary contributions of knowledge and information goods for the benefits of a collective, questions arise like how to solve the dilemma of public goods (Thorn and Connolly, 1987), and how to enhance participation in online community. From different perspectives, community members are motivated to participate by extrinsic rewards like bonus marks, intrinsic rewards like the sense of self-importance, and community interest.
However, there is a lack of quantitative studies on motivation and disincentives to participation in online learning communities. This study is an attempt to explore the relationship between peoples motivation and participation through a quantitative case study on a virtual community in a large university. The results will offer insights on peoples behavior in online learning communities."

The relational outcomes of interest here are uncertainty reduction and the states of both cognitive trust and behavioral trust. Uncertainty level and the cognitive state of trust should act as the preconditions for behavioral trust, as behavioral trust involves actual risk in a vulnerable situation rather than simply a perception of the other individual. In order to examine the causal relationship between information valence and multi-dimensional aspects of trust, an experiment was conducted. Participants were randomly given either positively or negatively valenced information about a confederate and were asked to fill out questionnaires assessing their uncertainty level and cognitive state of trust toward the confederate. The Prisoners Dilemma game was used to operationalize the construct of behavioral trust. The results indicated that valence of information had a significant effect on the cognitive level of trust, especially, perceived trustworthiness. However, information valence did not have a significant effect on predicting behavioral trust, except for the positively valenced information condition. The path model indicated that both uncertainty reduction level and perceived trustworthiness were significant predictors for behavioral trust when the individual was exposed to a piece of positive information about the partner."

Social learning theory contends that viewers can learn behaviors based on observation (Bandura, 1986). In order to discover what individuals are observing in the media content analyses are often performed. This study presents an examination of food, drink, tobacco, and drugs on adult programming. This examination was done to determine what the current depictions are within this type of programming. The top rated shows of 2002-2003 were chosen for analysis; both primetime programs and soap operas were examined. Several variables were examined to ascertain the amount of food, drink, tobacco, and drugs being viewed, what those items actually were (e.g. coffee vs. beer, pizza vs. cake), how the items were being used (e.g. consumed or discussed), the context of use (e.g. meal or not, location), if there were any motives for use (e.g. hunger/thirst), outcomes from usage (e.g. excessiveness or feeling better), and finally the demographics of those involved. It was found that there has been little change over time as to the type of food consumption being depicted (e.g. foods with low nutritional value, snacking versus partaking in meals) despite recent trends to attempt to bring down the percentages of overweight individuals in America. Drinks exceed foods within adult programming, non-alcoholic beverages exceed alcoholic drinks, and there are few instances of tobacco or drugs."
2005-1875,Winning Is(nt) Everything: The Paradox of Excellence and the Challenge of Organizational Epideictic,Organization-Public Relationships,Public Relations,,,Paper,Winning Is(nt) Everything: The Paradox of Excellence and the Challenge of Organizational Epideictic,Organization-Public Relationships,"At the confluence of rhetorical, organizational, and public relations studies lies organizational epideictic, discourse created by organizations in praise of common values that benefit the organization. This essay argues that such common values are problematized by the presence of paradox in even some of the most popular epideictic subjects. Through a case study of the NCAAs Stay in Bounds program teaching children to be good sports both on and off the field, the essay demonstrates the challenges of organizational epideictic through the paradox of excellence. It suggests that the NCAA should address the paradoxes inherent in its portrayal of excellence, and the essay extends this case to all organizations that would promote organizational values that contain competing priorities."
2005-1876,Women Networks: Experiences for a Democratic Approach to the Use of the Internet,Women Using Technology: From Cell Phones to On-line Dating,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,Women Networks: Experiences for a Democratic Approach to the Use of the Internet,Women Using Technology: From Cell Phones to On-line Dating,"The Internet as an agent of democratisation is a concept which is receiving increasing interest from social theorists around the world (Barranquero, 2003; Castells, 2001; Wallace, 1999). Some authors within the futuristic approach to information technologies support the argument that the Internet could help citizens revitalise democracy. However, a tension exists to this approach as the history of the design, development and use of the Internet is heavily male dominated. Whilst implicit in the nature of democracy is the idea of equality and sharing between genders, the feminist discourse has underlined the nature of the Internet as dominated by a technological elite integrated by men. From this perspective, it is urgent to analyse gender involvement in technologies in general and Internet in particular and the appropriation of the web by women networks.

This paper investigates the theoretical bases of these ideas (empowerment, appropriation, identity) and compares them with empirical analysis of the use of the Internet by groups of women in four different geographical areas: Europe, North America, Asia and Africa. A number of websites from these areas were selected in order to perform a content analysis and compare their use in reference to community service, social action promotion, womens involvement in political practices and new forms of interactive communication."
2005-1877,"Work, Communication and the Practice of Engineering Culture: Occupational Influences on Organizational Change",Communication and Organizational Change,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,"Work, Communication and the Practice of Engineering Culture: Occupational Influences on Organizational Change",Communication and Organizational Change,"This paper explores how occupational culture mediates the acceptance or refusal of organizationally-driven changes. Occupational ideologies filter experiences and influence interpretations and responses to organizational practices. Such filters often help workers accomplish tasks crucial to the functioning of the organization, but they also alter the proposed direction of organizationally-driven changes or even resist them forcibly. We attempt to demonstrate how the specific work practices conducted by members of an occupation create a culture that guides the acceptance and/or refusal of new work practices. We report the findings of a three-year qualitative study of software and computer engineering students. In total, we identify nine practices endemic to the culture of engineering. Our findings provide an empirical example of how the constellation of engineering work practices creates an occupational culture. We move one step past this observation, however, to suggest that the micro-level constitution of a culture occasions a macro-level structure that may then act back on the very practices that created it in the first place by mediating prospective changes to them. In other words, the relationship between work and culture might best be viewed as recursive. We discuss implications of this relationship between work and culture for organizationally-driven changes."

Among all of the commercials appearing in a composite week of primetime television programming on ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, WB, and UPN, only those commercials featuring domestic chores taking place in a house, yard, grocery store or laundromat were coded, resulting in a sample size of 477 commercials. Among the key findings: About 2/3 of the commercials featured females performing chores rather than males. There were 108 commercials (22.6%) in the sample in which a characters performance of a chore was a source of humor, and males were more likely than females to be the butt of such a joke. Males performance in chores was more likely to be met with a disapproving response from others (t = -6.88, p < .001), less likely to be satisfactory in both process (t = -7.01, p < .001) and outcome (t = -4.42, p < .001), and was generally less successful (t = 7.55, p < .001) than females performance of chores. The depictions examined in this study have important implications for how individuals can learn gender roles from television content, including the activities that individuals are presumed to excel at and the activities that they seem doomed to fail."
2005-1879,Writing Memory: Contributions to Postcolonial Feminist Theorizing,Theorizing the Feminine,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,Writing Memory: Contributions to Postcolonial Feminist Theorizing,Theorizing the Feminine,"This paper explores books written in the reflexive by three Asian American women: The Shock of the Arrival (1996), Meena Alexander; Dictee (1995[1982]), Theresa Hak Kyung Cha; and Ono Ono Girls Hula (1997), Carolyn Lei-lanilau. It argues that their writing challenges conventional history writing as a developmental narrative by taking up reflexive writing outside this developmental narrative structure. Their writing confronts this structures attempt at organizing knowledge of peoples that perpetuates a colonial knowledge system. This paper considers these womens reflexive writing as a challenge to colonial historical narratives on Asian/Asian American women through texts. By writing in personal experience, they disrupt colonial knowledge systems that depend on the silencing and differentiation of the third world. All three writers challenge any unifying moment in postcolonialism and a postcolonial identity by recognizing the fragmentation of identity or the inability to construct a complete identity for the postcolonial subject. Moreover, their writings recognize women significant in their personal experiences and in historical memory as active participants to nation-building. By doing so, these books contest liberal feminist articulations of a third world woman based on colonial knowledge systems and at the same time contribute to feminist theorizing. This paper includes and covers: (a) an examination of postcolonial writing (b) the three writers personal background, (c) the postcolonial self in textuality, (d) writing on territory, hybrid subjects, language, body, and (e) the writers contribution to feminist theorizing and methodology. This paper is submitted for consideration as a full-length paper."
2005-1880,You Can Take it With You. A Study of Wireless Local Number Portability Effects in the United States Telecommunications Market.,Communication Law and Policy Interactive Paper Session,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,You Can Take it With You. A Study of Wireless Local Number Portability Effects in the United States Telecommunications Market.,Communication Law and Policy Interactive Paper Session,"Assuming a Strategic scenario, in which regulation strives to increase economic efficiency, this research investigates a recent US telecommunications mandate requiring carriers to provide wireless local number portability (WLNP). Economic theory asserts WLNP reduces switching costs by allowing wireless consumers to keep their phone number when changing providers. The Federal Communications Commission mandated WLNP in order to increase competition in the industry, thus benefiting consumers. Using a combination of semi-structured expert interviews and thematic analysis of secondary documents, this research evaluates whether the WLNP mandate has achieved its intended effects. Key findings suggest WLNP encourages wireless carriers to increase the emphasis placed on consumer retention strategies, especially contractual switching costs. Carriers employed a number of retention campaigns including equipment upgrades linked to extended contract periods and initial inducements of high quality loss leaders to consumers willing to sign long-term contracts. This research further suggests that consumers no longer feel locked-in to their initial provider, and have become more selective and informed in their purchase decisions. While churn rates have been moderate, they will likely increase as porting technology is refined, current contracts expire, and consumers identify particular carriers with reputations of higher service quality. This research finds the ambiguously labeled costs recovery fees, harm consumers and masks economic inefficiency, in opposition to the intended effects of WLNP. These fees necessitate further investigative analysis and possible regulatory intervention. WLNP effectively reduces switching costs, enabling increased competition between carriers and increasing consumer purchase options."
2005-1881,You Can't Homogenize Success in PR: Top PR Executives Reveal 10 Patterns in Success,Public Relations Top Paper Session,Public Relations,,,Paper,You Can't Homogenize Success in PR: Top PR Executives Reveal 10 Patterns in Success,Public Relations Top Paper Session,"Interviews were conducted with 97 high-level PR executives to assess factors relating to professional success and leadership. Results suggest that the definitions of professional success, the metrics for gauging success, and the factors contributing to success are diverse and multidimensional.
Qualitative analysis of the interviews suggested 10 themes or patterns in success, including the power of performance, diversity of experiences, networks of relationships, complex communication skill sets, and passion and a proactive nature in work. Some modest gender differences also were noted.
The study contributes to our understanding of success factors in the field and captures perceptions about success among top public relations leaders, a group little represented in the literature on this topic."

Relationships Between Reasons and Methods in Romantic Breakups.",Communicating About Problems in Romantic Relationships,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,"You Know Why, the Question is How? Relationships Between Reasons and Methods in Romantic Breakups.",Communicating About Problems in Romantic Relationships,"This paper investigates the extent to which the reason an individual decides to end a romantic relationship influences the method s/he uses to accomplish the breakup. In Study 1 (n=118), Ducks (1982) reasons for breakups and Codys (1982) breakup strategies were assessed. Both typologies captured the data reasonably well with the addition of new categories. In Study 2, hypothetical scenarios were developed to represent the reasons for breakup from Study 1. Participants (n=245) were asked to rate how likely they would be to use the breakups strategies from Study 1, given the reason in the scenario. The results suggest that reason does not have a statistically significant or substantial influence on choice of breakup strategy. One exception was that participants were less likely to use an its not you its me strategy when the breakup stemmed from partner violating a norm. Results, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed."
2005-1883,Young Adults and a Model for Political Participation,Political Socialization: Revisiting the Role of the Media,Political Communication,,,Paper,Young Adults and a Model for Political Participation,Political Socialization: Revisiting the Role of the Media,"Among the many unsolved puzzles in research on participation in American politics is the apparent disengagement of young adults. Recent speculation on young adults and participation has argued that young adults are somehow different from older Americans. Yet empirical research, thus far, has not addressed the fundamental question: are models explaining participation for younger adults different from those explaining participation among older adults? Age differences in political participation are examined in order to better understand political participation among older and younger Americans. The results indicate that exactly the same model for political participation applies to both older and younger adults. The participation gap is a result of differences in political interest, discussion, knowledge, media use, mobilization, and partisanship."

However, in recent years, many young Japanese have been migrating to New York City and London for the purpose of engaging in cultural production in fields of dance, fashion, fine arts, film, hairstyling, popular music, etc. By using multisited ethnography, the present study has found that culture overwhelmingly explains the motivational cause for their migration, and media have played a large role in their migration process. In short, American and Western European media and popular culture, as well as Japanese media, have contributed to the construction of the image of the West in Japan over a long period, thereby establishing cultural-ideological links between Japan and the United States or Britain. As a result, these young people have come to hope to become part of the world they have seen, and actually have carried out their migration project to their imagined West."
2005-1901,Youre Nobody til Somebody Loves You: Seeking Esteem and Commitment Through Manipulation,dentity and Impression Mangagement in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Youre Nobody til Somebody Loves You: Seeking Esteem and Commitment Through Manipulation,Identity and Impression Mangagement in Interpersonal Communication,"While many factors influence individuals decision to remain in a relationship, identity is at the core of the evaluative process. Self-esteem is a filter through which individuals investments, satisfaction, and quality of alternatives in a romantic relationship are evaluated. This study tests the hypotheses that: (1) self-esteem is positively related to relational commitment independent of relational satisfaction, (2) self-esteem is negatively related to the endorsement of communicative and manipulative strategies to gain affirmation and commitment from partners, and (3) sex differences exist among the degree of self-esteem and the types of communicative strategies endorsed. A survey of 367 students from a large southwestern public university provided support for a multivariate model explaining identitys influence on relational value with the use of manipulation strategies. Furthermore, this study found that low self-esteem individuals are more likely to use negative types of manipulation that exclude the partner but include rivals. When individuals perceive low quality alternatives, they have a greater tendency to use jealousy induction. In short, low self-esteem individuals are more likely to endorse manipulation, thereby changing the partners behaviors to meet their relational expectations and desires. As the partner behaves in ways that fulfill the individuals expectations, the individuals commitment, satisfaction, and overall relational value increase."
2005-1902,Your Life is Waiting: Symbolic Meanings in Direct-to-Consumer Antidepressants Advertising,Making Sense of Health Product Advertisements and Preventive Health Messages,Health Communication,,,Paper,Your Life is Waiting: Symbolic Meanings in Direct-to-Consumer Antidepressants Advertising,Making Sense of Health Product Advertisements and Preventive Health Messages,"This paper addresses discourse in direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of antidepressants and how pharmaceutical companies, through DTC advertising, frame the debate around depression. It focuses on the use of two significant message construction tools: imagery (visuals) and words (copy), as an interlocking unit essential for understanding the effects on those who consume the messages. The paper begins by defining depression and then addresses how the pharmaceutical industry shifted gears to reach consumers in the advent of reduced government regulation. The analysis focuses on three antidepressant campaigns: Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil. The paper closes with commentary on the overarching themes that emerge, the ramifications of DTC advertising of antidepressants and suggestions for future research."
