2013-0001,2D vs. 3D: The Effects of Additional Dimension in Visual Field on Information Processing,Message Processing and Persuasion,Information Systems,Extended Abstract,,2D vs. 3D: The Effects of Additional Dimension in Visual Field on Information Processing,Message Processing and Persuasion,"Visual information is believed to be processed automatically, using small amount of cognitive resources (Lang, Potter, & Bolls, 1999). This study explores how change in dimension (2D vs. 3D) affects the cognitive load on individuals. Based on the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing, or LC4MP (Lang, 2006), an experiment has been designed using video clips varying in its density of structural features and levels of arousing content. The results provides general support for LC4MP, suggesting that additional dimension in the visual field provided by 3D technology do increase the cognitive load in processing mediated messages. To date, this project has collected data from 21 subjects, and will complete with additional forty or more (total N > 60) by ICA 2013."

Five hundred and ninety-two individuals completed an online survey instrument. In general, results revealed significant relationships in the expected directions between couple types and relational control, power, trait verbal aggressiveness, and relational happiness. The dimensional approach to relational control was also supported and provided an additional mechanism for further discerning patterns across violent couple types. Thus, the findings from this study support many of the basic structures of the RCMA, namely the control dimensions and several couple types. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
2013-0101,An Exploration of Concealment and Discovery in Romantic Infidelity,Advances in Deception and Deception Detection,Interpersonal Communication,Paper,,An Exploration of Concealment and Discovery in Romantic Infidelity,Advances in Deception and Deception Detection,"Infidelity is not only a pervasive phenomenon in romantic relationships, but is often marked by secrecy, deception, and discovery. The current study had two overarching goals: (1) to uncover concealment strategies used by individuals engaging in infidelity, and (2) to understand the process of information-seeking from the perspective of the partner. Content analysis indicated that individuals use several concealment strategies simultaneously to hide their infidelity. Verbal strategies, including bald-face lies and equivocation were reported most frequently. Analysis of the partner’s experience of the discovery of infidelity corresponds with the Theory of Motivated Information Management; that is, suspicious behavior and a desire to know the truth trigger subsequent information-seeking actions. Infidelity encompasses more than just a violation of a sexual or emotional contract between partners; secrecy, deception, and discovery are often involved in many individuals’ experiences. The current study expands our understanding of this event through an exploration of its correlates."
2013-0151,"A Study of 3D HDTV Adoption: An Analysis of Predictors, Perceptions, and Behavioral Intention",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,Communication and Technology,Paper,"Media Technology, Diffusion","A Study of 3D HDTV Adoption: An Analysis of Predictors, Perceptions, and Behavioral Intention",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,"3D HDTV is a new form of TV viewing technology. This study applied Rogers’ (2003) innovation-decision process model to examine the effects of potential predictors and individuals’ perceptions about 3D HDTV on the behavioral intention of adopting 3D HDTV. Survey responses from 188 participants were analyzed and the research results show that participants had a relatively high level of knowledge about 3D HDTV. Rogers’ five characteristics of an innovation—relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability—are positively related to the behavioral intention of adopting 3D HDTV. Individuals who have less knowledge about 3D HDTV, who are more innovative, who have more favorable attitude toward 3D HDTV, and who perceive less cost of watching 3D HDTV and perceive fewer health concerns about using 3D HDTV are more likely to adopt 3D HDTV. Gender was not found to have significant effect on adoption intention. This study also found that the use of video-related technologies such as HDTV and video game player are positively related to the adoption intention. The findings of a regression test suggest the perception about relative advantages of 3D HDTV and the attitude toward 3D HDTV can effectively influence individuals’ behavioral intention when controlling for other predictors."

Explorations Into the (Dis)ordering Properties of Communication,Communication Constituting Organizations: The CCO Perspective,Organizational Communication,Paper,,Beware of the Spirits That You Call! Explorations Into the (Dis)ordering Properties of Communication,Communication Constituting Organizations: The CCO Perspective,"This paper proposes to study the constitution of organization by acknowledging the fundamentally intertwined nature of order and disorder. Adopting a dialectical approach, which underlines the (dis)ordering nature of organization, the paper explores the mediating role of communication by focusing more specifically on the symbolic and the material dimension of language use as expressed in texts. Taking a communication-centered approach – mainly inspired from the “CCO” perspective (“communicative as constitutive of organizations”) –, the paper shows that efforts/effects of ordering are continuously haunted by disordering, that is, the plurality of many potential orders, which are at work in communication. Relying on the empirical material of three qualitative case studies in three distinct project-based organizations, it accounts for the key and yet paradoxical role of ordering devices, which are designed to create and maintain order, and because of their language-based nature, generate contingency and undecidability (in the same or in a neighboring domain), at the same time."

Please specify:",Call Your Legislator: A Field Experimental Study of the Impact of Citizen Contacts on Legislative Voting,Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,"We test whether or not citizen contacts influence policymaker behavior. Our design involves random assignment of (state removed) legislators to be contacted by their own constituents about a bill under consideration by the state legislature at the time of the study. The field experimental design allows us to produce internally valid estimates of the influence of constituent contacts on legislative voting. The estimated effect is substantial: being contacted by constituents increases the probability of supporting the relevant legislation by 12 percentage points. The probability that a legislator votes for the legislation increases as the number of calls increase, although at a declining rate. We discuss the theoretical and normative implications of this result as well as suggestions for future research."

Based on a cultural economic analysis, this paper characterizes Capitole as a first-run cinema with a broadly appealing program, maximizing revenue and attendance. This paper aims to make a contribution to the advancement of cultural economics in film studies by connecting cinema and the sociocultural space through an economic perspective."
2013-0351,Communicative Leadership: Leaders and Members Reflecting on Leadership and Communication,Follow Me: Leadership Communication and Rhetoric in Organizations,Organizational Communication,Paper,,Communicative Leadership: Leaders and Members Reflecting on Leadership and Communication,Follow Me: Leadership Communication and Rhetoric in Organizations,"Despite several studies considering leadership discourse in organizations, the discursive construction of leadership communication by organizational actors is still under-researched. In this study, applying a social constructionist perspective to leadership and drawing from discursive leadership theory (Fairhurst, 2007) we investigate how leaders and employees in two Swedish organizations discursively construct a “communicative” leader. Data from Organization A consists of 17 individual interviews with leaders and 16 focus group interviews with employees. In Organization B, data include eight interviews with leaders and four employee focus groups. Using qualitative methods, we identify different dimensions of communicative leadership, compare leaders’ and members’ understandings of the concept, and compare how communicative leadership emerges in the two organizations. Findings illustrate the situatedness and socially constructed nature of leadership and leader behaviors, and show how co-constructed notions of leadership behaviors or leadership communication influence the communication environments of organizational actors.

Expanding First Amendment Rights to New Pastures,"Rights to Information and Access: Interpretation, Implementation, and Use","When the Supreme Court of the United States decided Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia in 1980, Justice John Paul Stevens declared it “a watershed case.” For the first time, the Court in Richmond Newspapers identified a First Amendment right to gather news – and, in particular, a right of access for the press and public to attend criminal trials. Although Justice Stevens apparently held high hopes for the newly created right of access, in the immediate aftermath of Richmond Newspapers, it appeared that the right would be limited to trials and other judicial proceedings. But an interesting development is occurring with Justice Stevens’ prediction. Slowly but surely, some lower courts are expanding the scope of the First Amendment right of access. This paper analyzes the Supreme Court’s creation of First Amendment right of access and explores the rise of First Amendment access in new domains outside of the judicial branch."

The research questions for this project are: When and how does the francophone newsmagazine Telquel use Darija in its stories? How does Telquel engage in and position itself as a leader in the debate about language policy in Morocco? Textual analysis of Telquel over a one-year period (2010-2011) is used to investigate how language and power are defined by various groups, how people are included or excluded from those definitions, and how Moroccan identity is debated in a moment of globalization and in the context of recent social movements in the Arab world. This study argues that Telquel is endorsing a modernist project of normative democracy and acting as a space of intervention aimed at pulling together multiple cultural and political spheres."

Scholarship around presence is increasing, and increasingly important. as the range of available modes of communication via technology multiply at the beginning of the 21st century. Many, though not all, of us will soon have the ability to interact with real or artificial people, places and events with a nearly limitless set of choices of sensory channel, setting and quality. The presentation will briefly review the ‘big picture’ of presence – how its phenomena, concepts, literatures, institutions and research and professional communities have evolved and predictions about what’s next."

The study examined the overall presence of digital commentary in specific community as well as examined in-depth a specific episode in which community members rose up to challenge a television station’s reporting. Overall, this study found four conditions present in connection with robust dialogue: A spark, something around which an audience can coalesce; a place where such conversation is expected; policies that allow relatively unfettered communication and a sufficient mass of audience to keep the sphere inflated and energized. In addition, this study found that the medium was incidental to this process. Further, this study also found little dialogue taking place during routine times."

We find that, contrary to the idea that the “news has gone soft,” the narratively sparse and fact-loaded straight news format is the dominant storytelling option for both journalists and consumers. By contrast, the newer storytelling options such as blogs and user-generated content exhibit extremely low levels of popularity among both groups. Moreover, there is a gap between the supply and demand of online news: journalists oversupply straight news that deal with public affairs topics and undersupply other format-content combinations. These findings contribute to the study of journalism by shedding light on the dynamics of agenda-setting and public affairs information dissemination in high-choice media environments."
2013-0701,From Monophonic to Jazzy Integrated Communications,Public Relations and Communication Channels,Public Relations,Paper,,From Monophonic to Jazzy Integrated Communications,Public Relations and Communication Channels,"Within corporate communications, two contradictory tendencies appear to be asserting themselves. On the one hand, many companies are concerned with integrating their PR and marketing communications, so as to speak with one voice, while on the other, many companies make a virtue of their differences, both within and outside the organisation. In this paper, we will examine four different approaches to integrated communications which relate in different ways to these trends. The various approaches are typologised with the help of musical metaphors. The four forms are: monophonic, unison, polyphonic and jazzy integrated communications. Both theorists and practitioners are drawn upon in the examination, as well as intermediate positions – theoretical practitioners and practical theorists."

Drawing from Foucaultian studies of governmentality and critical studies of consumer culture, I view advertising as a form of government. Advertisements hail the viewers as consumers; the marketers aim at mobilizing people as consumers by constructing particular forms of subjectivity. The data covers bank advertisements in 1954 – 2008 in the leading current affairs weekly magazine Suomen Kuvalehti and the human interest weekly Apu. As result, from 1950’s to 1980’s the consumers were represented mainly as rational subjects (homo economicus), yet they were addressed as wards by the banks. Alongside a representation of an emotion-driven consumer (homo emotiocus) was increasingly visible in particular from the 1980’s. This is when the Customer Relationship Marketing took over in marketing thinking and the consumers were addressed more as equals like partners."

A quasi-experimental sur-vey of 134 German journalists (34 %) and 163 scientists / scholars (33 %) from different sub-ject areas was conducted to investigate a) how much the professionals commit themselves to objectivity, b) how they define objectivity and c) if a scientific understanding of objectivity improves journalists’ news decisions. Results suggest the contrary. Journalists and academic professionals are highly committed to objectivity but have different understandings of it. The more journalists subscribe to the definition that is prevalent in their profession, the more they criticize exaggerated or selective accounts of reality. The more journalists accept academics’ criteria of objectivity the more they seem to excuse exaggerated or incomplete accounts. Moreover, a strong commitment to objectivity enhances criticism toward exaggerated or selective accounts in both professions."

Every concept can be described by means of the semantic differential analysis (i.e., the Tucker standard test). All possible concretions (visualisations) of these conceptual associative and connotative clusters form the imagological potential. From this imagological menu of outwardly different but semantically related potential concretions (visualisations) _ so-called allotropes _ an image-maker (brand-builder) can choose the most favorables to initiate the implicit story-telling as a new brand awareness of the audience. The mechanism of conceiving and generating stories operates in the most efficient way as the Sampo of the Finnish epic _ as a hidden quern grinding flour, salt and money of thin air."

Applying corpus comparison method, the present study especially delineates patterns of expressions used in actual text messages. Results revealed that gender differences persist in texting behavior: (1) girls exchange more messages than boys do; (2) girls are more likely to develop and maintain relationship through texting, whereas boys use text messages mainly for flirting; (3) language which girls used in texting includes more self-disclosure of their emotions and personal information; (4) expressions for politeness occur more frequently in girls’ text messages. Theoretical explanations of gender differences in mobile texting are provided. The strengths and limitations of keyword comparison method are discussed as well."

This is an excerpt from Reviving the Self: Beyond the Wandering Womb (working title of a book in progress). In Chapter 2: Letting go of superwoman: Embodying the mother-child dyad, I present findings from 44 in-depth interviews with biological mothers of newborns to understand how the mother-child dyad impacted their meaning making of health. Participants acknowledged the intrinsic duality of the mother-child dyad and reformulated traditional expectations of “putting the baby first.” This chapter weaves an eclectic mix of feminist theory and scholars, including Foucault, Pollock, Martin and Friedan to explicate how women make meaning of medicalization. Participants described a contest over their bodies in relation to diet and exercise before, during, and after pregnancy. These women resisted the biomedical paradigm in various ways, such as through trusting their bodies and valuing storytelling and personal narrative as a form of expertise."

How Foreign TV News Affects Individual Cynicism in Post-Colonial Hong Kong,Covering the World: Foreign Correspondents and Foreign News,Journalism Studies,Paper,"Bias in News, Media Effects - Other, Quantitative approach",Making the World a Distant Place? How Foreign TV News Affects Individual Cynicism in Post-Colonial Hong Kong,Covering the World: Foreign Correspondents and Foreign News,"This paper examines the psychological impact of foreign television news on political cynicism in Hong Kong. We hypothesize that exposure to the prevalent negative events and conflicts in international news will lead to the audience’s cynical perception of the world. Given Hong Kong’s colonial history and its highly mobilized population, we further investigate the role of individual globality and immigration status in the process. A random digit dialing telephone survey was conducted in 2009 to select a sample of 600 Hong Kong residents aged between 18 and 70. The results showed that individual attention to foreign news of deviants was positively associated with political cynicism among those first-generation immigrants who were born in mainland China or elsewhere, but negatively related among local Hong Kongers. The implications of the findings were discussed."

Usual explanations for the success of these parties are based on notions related to economics, national identity or cultural alienation. Some authors, however, have shown that the mass media also play a significant role. Whereas these studies provide evidence drawing on macro-level data resources and/or qualitative accounts, there is little systematic evidence about how mass media coverage may affect support for the populist right on the level of the individual voter. The current study adds to the existing literature on media and political populism by 1) its individual-level focus, 2) the use of an experimental design employing multiple cues: an immigration cue, an anti-politics cue and a party cue, and 3) by drawing on explicit and implicit data for party support. We find effects of certain cues on both implicit and explicit support for far right parties, moderated by political knowledge."

Yet, systematic research on the impact of mobile technologies on health outcomes remains scarce. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive view of what has been done so far, and to understand how the introduction of new smartphones has changed research in the field. A systematic literature review was conducted on a sample of 117 articles published between 2002 and 2012 to understand the main impact areas of mobile technologies, the methodology and the features used, and the type of outcome measures adopted. Results showed that the research interest towards m‐Health is growing, however the new opportunities offered by new mobile technologies do not seem to have been explored so far. Mapping the evolution of the field permits a better understanding of its strengths and weaknesses, and can inform future developments."

Relying on large scale online survey data in South Korea (N = 2,028), this study finds that (1) comparative optimism is enlarged as the targeted others are younger, (2) online knowledge and others-caring personality increases comparative optimism by mainly influencing perceived target risk and prior experience of privacy infringement increases comparative optimism by mainly influencing perceived personal risk, and (3) comparative optimism is related with both more adoption of privacy-protective behaviors and support for government regulatory policy on the use of online information."

Although research in this area is known for a number of stable patterns, we argue that these are under greater strain than ever before, and that key assumptions about how individuals acquire political information from the media must be continually investigated. In this paper, we use data from a nationally representative online survey to provide just such a reexamination of relationships between news media use and political knowledge. We find that by some measures, directed internet searches have come to rival television news as a source for information, and that newspapers no longer appear to have the strongest educative influences. In addition to providing an updated assessment of media use and political knowledge patterns, we consider the implications of our findings for contemporary theoretical discussions within the field of political communication."

2013-1701,Sweden: Are Direct Press Subsidies the Preferred Solution?,Policy Failure in Confronting the Journalism Crisis: Evidence From the US and Europe,Communication Law & Policy,Session Paper,,Sweden: Are Direct Press Subsidies the Preferred Solution?,Policy Failure in Confronting the Journalism Crisis: Evidence From the US and Europe,"Direct press subsidies to second-ranking newspapers in the market are undoubtedly one of the most distinctive features of Swedish media policy. They have been used since 1971, when a political majority from the Social Democratic Party and the Centre Party reached on agreement in the Parliament. The system has always been highly controversial; perceived either as an attack on the free press or as a guarantee for pluralism in the market. In recent years, digital media developments and EU media policy have put the press subsidy system and its basic principles under new pressures. The efficiency of the system is also disputed. The subsidies have saved newspapers with economic problems and the decrease in newspaper titles in Sweden is not as articulated as in many other countries. On the other hand, the system has not affected media ownership concentration and most subsidized newspapers are today owned by commercially successful companies."

In the post-liberalized Indian film industry, which gained official economic recognition in 1998, proponents assert that digital technologies are revolutionizing the popular Hindi film industry, particularly through the expansion of online streaming services, mass retailing of DVD and blu-ray discs, and construction of multiplex cinemas that feature high-definition digital and 3-D stereoscopic viewing options, as has been the case elsewhere in Asia (Curtin, 2009; Ganti, 2012; Rai, 2009; Stephanie, Sharma, & Ramasubbu, 2012). However, critics assert that such technologies also threaten to demassify consumption practices in South Asia, disrupting democratic viewing traditions within these cinematic public spheres (Ganti, 2012). In this presentation, I explore the technological and social issues relative to the rapid transition from celluloid to digital exhibition in South Asia, and then position these issues within broader theoretical debates over globalization and cultural hybridity."
2013-1801,The Digital Globe and Climactic Coming Attractions: From Theatrical Release to Theatre of War,Earth Observing Media,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique",Session Paper,,The Digital Globe and Climactic Coming Attractions: From Theatrical Release to Theatre of War,Earth Observing Media,"This paper considers the politics of representation inherent in the emergence of the digital globe. Starting with a consideration of early renaissance globes as separate and distinct cultural objects from the two dimensional forms of cartography they followed, this article goes on to consider the emergence of the digital globe. Like its analogue predecessors, the digital globe is an object symptomatic of the multiple cultural, political, philosophical, ecological and sociological factors that form its foundation. Crucially, beyond occidental perspectives that have structured many dominant cartographic accounts of the earth since the renaissance, this article argues that a multipolar environment of online digital globes are emerging to contest western structures of vision that were intertwined with notions of technoscopic superiority of the twentieth century. Instead what is now emerging is a multiplicity of digital globes that function as theatrical platforms for different and diverse agencies. Here the digital globe is analysed in relation to some of their theatrical functions: as a site of spectacular cinematic attractions, as theatre for the dramatic staging of news media events, as a simulated military theatre of operations, as a lecture theatre where the science of geo-engineering is dramatized and as an operation theatre where the planets rapidly declining health is played out."

Women’s presence in media companies in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, particularly, grew faster than men’s. This presentation problematizes the finding of women’s dominance within the historical framework of communism and in light of events in today’s post-communist era. Factors examined include labor issues under communism, women’s skills levels and adaptability to change, and the shift to a commercialized media system that brought with it an entertainment-orientation in media content and a sensationalism of news. The presentation will also explore why women’s dominance in media fields has done little to erase the underlying patriarchal nature of Eastern European societies."
2013-1901,"The Israeli Term for Talk ""Tokbek"" (Talk-Back - Online Commenting) and its Relevance to the Online Public Sphere",Technologically-Mediated Interactions: Problems and Promises for Civic Engagement and Interpersonal Interactions,Language & Social Interaction,Extended Abstract,,"The Israeli Term for Talk ""Tokbek"" (Talk-Back - Online Commenting) and its Relevance to the Online Public Sphere",Technologically-Mediated Interactions: Problems and Promises for Civic Engagement and Interpersonal Interactions,"Israeli journalistic websites introduced a feature that later became popular elsewhere - the ""comments"" section where readers can inscribe their responses to the report. This form of commenting received its own term for talk tokbek, derived from the English term “talk-back.” From cultural members' perspective, while the tokbek had unlimited technological potential to promote new modes of civil engagement, it failed in achieving this goal and evolved to an anti-discourse that frequently undermines attempts on constructive dialogue. Grounded in the ethnography of communication, we provide a cultural interpretative framework for the analysis of this discursive failure. The main communicative action of the tokbek is to construct the commenters’ political selves, mainly based on “the Leftist” and “the Rightist” stereotypes. The tokbek discourse thus facilitates a bashing ritual that communicates a radical pessimism about the very possibility of its own communicability. So doing, the tokbek ritual joins similar Israeli cultural performances that substitute democratic deliberation with a pseudo-political venting arena. While not implying that the internet is incapable of promoting a democratic public sphere, we contend that cultural contexts as established through interactions cannot be overlooked when discussing technological advancements and their relevancy to political participation."
2013-1951,The Political Mapping of Korean Twitter Users,Politics Online: International Perspectives,Political Communication,Paper,"Quantitative - Network Analysis, Deliberation & Political Conversation",The Political Mapping of Korean Twitter Users,Politics Online: International Perspectives,"This study employs network analysis, while focusing on the discussion of South Korean president, Lee Myung-Bak, to better understand public opinion dynamics occurring on Twitter. More specifically, the study seeks to identify opinion leaders on the discussion network by looking over a longitudinal distribution of tweets that include the president’s name. In so doing, this study analyzed three types of messages: “followed,” “mention,” and “retweet.” The data, collected between November 1, 2011 and April 20, 2012, includes 53,165 twitter users and 1,144,306 lines consisting of three types of relationship. By looking over the density of subgroups classified by their political view, the study also examines whether Twitter users, in their discussion of the president, are likely to be exposed to cross-cutting political views. The findings show that the discussion of Lee Myung-Bak is dominated by liberal Twitter users who already have great influence on the public even offline. Furthermore, Twitter users appear unlikely to interact with those who have opposing political views."

We build upon research in communication, political science, social psychology, and social networks to identify relevant predictors. We analyze relationships at the dyadic level, but we also consider the aggregated accuracy of perceptions by ego of alters (“perceptiveness”) and the aggregated accuracy of perception by alters of ego (“explicitness”) regarding political candidate preferences using a multilevel modeling approach. We find relatively low levels of accuracy on average, and differential patterns of prediction of perceptiveness and explicitness. However, there is a consistent and strong link between the frequency of communication (viewed as an indicator of network tie strength) and accuracy both at the dyadic and aggregate levels. However, this relationship is moderated by the homophily of political preferences within the group."
2013-2051,The Ubiquity and Influence of CMC Cues in Social Networking Sites,Nonverbal Cues Exchanges in Online Communications,Communication and Technology,Paper,"Computer-Mediated Communication, Social Media, Social Networking Service",The Ubiquity and Influence of CMC Cues in Social Networking Sites,Nonverbal Cues Exchanges in Online Communications,"A significant portion of the online activities by customers and other organizational stakeholders use text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC). Facebook status updates, Tweets, blog posts and e-mails are used for communicating organizational messages, engaging customers, and spreading electronic word of mouth. It has been suggested that CMC cues are those components of text-based CMC which fulfill a comparable role to that carried out by nonverbal cues in spoken communication. We make use of linguistic and quantitative analyses of several thousand Facebook and Twitter messages to empirically demonstrate the ubiquity and influence of these cues in online messages posted to social networking sites (SNSs). We establish that CMC cues have an influence comparable to that of nonverbal cues in spoken communication by showing that (1) the presence of specific CMC cues is associated with changes in SNS audience engagement and attitude, and (2) there is an inverse relationship between message length and CMC cue density. The paper discusses the theoretical implications for CMC theories such as social information processing, media richness theory, and a series of theories which developed in response to the failure of media richness theory to predict the meteoric success of text-based CMC in organizational and interpersonal communication."

Focusing on a central but little-studied figure, the documentary photographer Humphrey Spender, I analyze the politics of representing people--and of being represented--through documentary photography in the media environment of 1930s Britain. Based on archival research as well as formal analysis, this study links Spender’s photography with broader developments in the history of media in the period, including the grassroots sociological research group Mass Observation, the cinematic experimentation of the Continental avant-garde, the British documentary movement, and the rise of photographically illustrated magazines like Picture Post. In so doing, it illuminates a crucial development in the history of photography: a historical moment when the camera was seen to have the capacity to reveal the truth only when it was itself concealed."

Studying anti-fans, then, enables us to bring our focus to an exploration of the expectations and values we have of media texts. Such an exploration is useful for understanding the divergent responses from fans and anti-fans to the Twilight series. Through a sample of 472 anti-Twilighters, collected alongside a larger sample of Twilight fans, we explore anti-fans’ evaluations of the Twilight series (making sense of why their “favorite character” is a van that almost killed the series’ protagonist) and its fans (whom anti-fans call “Twitards”). By comparing the characteristics of anti-Twilighters to Twilight fans, we discuss why the two groups are so polarized, and how anti-Twilighters can extend our knowledge of anti-fans more generally.

A convenience sample of undergraduate students (n=375) completed a written questionnaire that asked about the frequency of sleep-related conversation, number of conversation partners, content of sleep-related conversation, and beliefs about sleep behaviors (based on the Integrative Model of Behavior Prediction). Conversations about health-damaging sleep behaviors were associated with the beliefs that sleeping 8-9 hours of sleep per night (a) will produce unfavorable social and academic outcomes and (b) are largely out of one’s behavioral control. Measures of conversation content explained more variance than simple measures of frequency and predicted lower intentions to perform the behavior. Content-specific conversation measures appear to be valid and should be considered in future health communication research."

Specifically, this study examines (1) the degree to which journalists use public relations materials, and (2) what factors influence the use of public relations materials.

A Web survey was conducted in December 2009 for U.S. business journalists (N = 120).

The results showed that public relations materials were most frequently used as a story’s background information and/or as a minor part of a story that came from another source or from several sources. Among the fourteen factors, journalistic experience, time pressure, ongoing relationships via e-mail and social media, and the perceived value of public relations materials had significant impacts on the degree of use of public relations materials."
