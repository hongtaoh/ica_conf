2003-0001,Access to the Media Versus Access to Audiences: The Distinction and its Implications for Media Regulation and Policy,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Access to the Media Versus Access to Audiences: The Distinction and its Implications for Media Regulation and Policy,"When the issue of speakers' rights of access arises in media regulation and policy contexts, the focus typically is on the concept of speakers' rights of access ""to the media,"" or ""to the press."" This right typically is premised on the audience's need for access to diverse sources and content. In contrast, in many non-mediated contexts, the concept of speakers' rights of access frequently is defined in terms of the speaker's own First Amendment right of access to audiences. This paper explores the distinctions between these differing interpretations of a speaker's access rights and argues that the concept of a speaker's right of access to audiences merits a more prominent position in media regulation and policy. This paper then explores the implications of such a shift in perspective for media regulation and policy-making."
2003-0051,An Experimental Evaluation of Readers' Perceptions of Media Bias,  Individual Submission type: Paper,An Experimental Evaluation of Readers' Perceptions of Media Bias,"We explored the perceptions of media bias on the part of news article readers by manipulating their expectations of bias and the topic of the stimulus materials. Readers were more likely to designate material in opposition to their own viewpoints as biased. The statements often indicated as biased were quotations, rather than the other types of statement in the reports. Also, the perception of bias was topic-dependent."
2003-0101,Buddhist Public Relations Model for Thai Community Development: Theoretical and Practical Implications,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Buddhist Public Relations Model for Thai Community Development: Theoretical and Practical Implications,"This research study challenges the conventional public relations by examining alternative public relations for Thai community-based organizations. The researcher views the conventional public relations practices in Thailand as simply following Western paradigms, often found unfit in the Thai contexts. The alternative model is reconceptualized within the Buddhism-based buranagarn framework, which embraces the understanding of complexity, plurality, interrelatedness, and interdependence of social reality. In an attempt to examine the interplay of the Buddhism-based buranagarn framework and the Western qualitative perspective, the term relational integration is introduced. Within the relational integration framework, this study integrates the Buddhist way of thinking into the critical public relations theory and research, and coins this new concept as Buddhist public relations.
Through the integrated research method of critical-qualitative ethnography and collaborative action research, the researcher develops the experiential knowledge of public relations as community-building and co-operative learning process for community-based organizations from the particular locales in Bangkok metropolitan and the North-East region of Thailand. It is found that to facilitate the Buddhist public relations for community-based organizations, three major approaches needs to be taken into consideration: 1) Building Buddhist values as moral and spiritual groundwork; 2) Developing dialectic dialogue through community culture and social relationships; and 3) Facilitating community interaction."
2003-0151,"Comparative Analysis of Street-based, Brothel-based, and Discreet Commercial Sex Workers on Factors Predicting Condom Use",  Individual Submission type: Paper,"Comparative Analysis of Street-based, Brothel-based, and Discreet Commercial Sex Workers on Factors Predicting Condom Use","The objective was to examine the relative vulnerability of different categories of female commercial sex workers (CSWs) to HIV infection. In this study, we considered the consistent use of condoms as an effective preventive measure against HIV infection. Research has shown that condom use is predicted by several cognitive and environmental variables such as AIDS knowledge, perception of vulnerability, perception of outcome expectancies, perception of social support, peer-group comparison, and condom use self-efficacy. Therefore, to examine the relative vulnerability to HIV infection we examined the variance in factors listed above among three categories of female CSWs in the city of Chennai in India.
The study found significant differences among the three groups of CSWs on the following factors: AIDS knowledge, perception of vulnerability, perception of social support, and peer-group comparison. The study will have wide implications for designing HIV/AIDS prevention interventions, public health campaigns and policies that are targeted at the vulnerable CSW population in Chennai and other places in India."

Drawing from New Social Movement collective identity literature, it employs rhetorical analysis of e-mail list serves used to organize the demonstrations and educate participants, finding that these lists used three means of building identity: a) calling for mutual aid b) facilitating dialogue and c ) promoting an analytical approach."
2003-0251,Effects of Global Television News On US Policymaking,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Effects of Global Television News On US Policymaking,"This study investigates the effects of global television news on the formulation and implementation of U.S. foreign policy. While it found no evidence to support the CNN effect, a hypothesis that claims global television now determines policy, it does present evidence and analysis of other significant effects on various phases and dimensions of policymaking. This study also suggests that global news coverage has created political, professional, and ethical dilemmas for the three major groups of participants in policymaking: politicians, officials, and journalists. Furthermore, it asserts that these groups have not yet sufficiently adjusted to the new television saturated environment of policymaking."
2003-0301,Flock Theory: A New Model of Emergent Self-Organization in Human Interaction,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Flock Theory: A New Model of Emergent Self-Organization in Human Interaction,"This paper introduces a new theory of emergent self-organization in human interaction. Flock Theory draws from a theoretical basis of emergence and self-organizing systems (Contractor, 1994; Hodgson, 2000; Monge & Contractor, 2001; Monge & Eisenberg, 1987). Likewise, two other important theoretical works are offered, Eric Eisenbergs work on the transcendent organization of jamming (Eisenberg, 1990), and R. Keith Sawyers work on the Emergence of Creativity (Sawyer, 1999). Catalyzed by a computer graphic simulation of a flock of birds by Craig Reynolds (Reynolds, 1987), and conceived to model jazz improvisation, Flock Theory is presented axiomatically. Focusing on the optimization of group members distance, the maintenance of leadership, and matching of direction of other individuals, this theory poses a model of human interaction that captures the potentially egalitarian effects of a cooperative evolution. Methods and applications of Flock Theory extend across disciplines, from task groups to online interaction."
2003-0351,Historical Drifts Without Paradigm Shifts: A Historical Analysis of Newspaper Coverage of Social Protest,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Historical Drifts Without Paradigm Shifts: A Historical Analysis of Newspaper Coverage of Social Protest,"This study presents results from a content analysis of newspaper coverage of protests movements by Wisconsin newspapers over a period of four decades (1960 to 1999). Analysis focused on differences and similarities in issues protested across time and location, while comparing regional and local papers. Included in these examinations are the topics of protests, the range of protest targets, and differences in coverage across newspapers with regard to location of protest as an intervening variable. In the process, this study brings past research on the protest paradigm under the purview of historical analysis by examining trends over time using a Midwestern state as a case study."
2003-0401,"Instant Identity: Girls, Adolescence and Negotiation of Identity in the New Culture of Instant Messaging",  Individual Submission type: Paper,"Instant Identity: Girls, Adolescence and Negotiation of Identity in the New Culture of Instant Messaging","Recent studies show that millions of adolescent girls in the past few years have turned to a relatively new real-time communication technology, Instant Messaging, as a primary means of communication with their peers. This raises intriguing questions about how adolescent girls  a group that historically was placed at the margins of study  may use Instant Messaging to negotiate and articulate identity at a particularly turbulent time in their lives. This preliminary study uses the qualitative methods of interview and narrative analysis to investigate this phenomenon with a framework grounded in poststructuralist feminist theory and cultural studies views of identity construction. Its findings suggest adolescent girls have come up with creative uses for the technology that are at once empowering to them but also suggest adherence to patriarchal cultural norms."
2003-0451,Letters to America: Dialectical epistolarity in post-9/11 advertising,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Letters to America: Dialectical epistolarity in post-9/11 advertising,"In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York and Washington, advertisers sought to reassure their clients and colleagues that business would continue and that the nation would recover. Many of the full-page advertisements in the New York Times during the six weeks following the attacks were framed as letters. This study draws upon the literatures of epistolary critique, visual meaning and metaphor, and rhetorical criticism to explore the rhetorical device of framing ads as letters. We utilize the triadic classification system of Charles Sanders Peirce to classify the letters-as-ads into either iconic, indexical or symbolic frames. Our initial assumption that more graphically iconic ads would rely less on textual metaphor, and vice versa, was confirmed. Finally, we encourage the consideration of epistolary rhetoric as a critical tool of analysis."
2003-0501,More Multicultural Than Thou: The News Paradigm and the Sjöbo Affair in the Swedish Press,  Individual Submission type: Paper,More Multicultural Than Thou: The News Paradigm and the Sjöbo Affair in the Swedish Press,"This project examines newspaper coverage as an expression of societys need for stories that underscore powerful norms regarding ethnicity and multiculturalism. What is the role of journalists in voicing norms and myths about issues related to race and ethnicity?
The case subject is the refusal of a Swedish town, Sjöbo, to accept refugees in 1987 and 1988 in violation of national immigration policy. A storm of negative coverage accompanied the unfolding political situation; in its wake, the town came to symbolize xenophobia, racism, and general backwardness in Swedish society.

The paper begins with Stephen Reeses idea of a News Paradigm, seeking to understand the medias role in supporting the dominant ideology and the News Paradigms function therein. Data were gathered using content and discourse analysis of 300 newspaper articles as well as transcriptions of depth interviews with the journalists who regularly covered the story.

The analysis indicates that the news paradigm is strong but not invisible, because journalists operate self-consciously within it. The newspaper article texts are strikingly similar both in terms of the normative consensus they support and in terms of the professional ideology reflected in them. However, interviews with the journalists suggest that they felt trapped by the news paradigm, implying that its primary strength, its invisibility, is undermined by individual journalist sensibilities.

In addition, analysis of newspaper articles reveals that the medias role in describing and perhaps perpetuating events became a prominent subtext in the newspaper narrative."
2003-0551,Organizational Culture Approaching the Edge: A Case Study of Organizational Change,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Organizational Culture Approaching the Edge: A Case Study of Organizational Change,"This report begins by describing different orders of change and how complex adaptive systems evolve. Systems may reach a bifurcation point where the entire system must change. Managers have developed strategic initiatives to accomplish transformative change, but these initiatives normally fail unless there is a culture change. The purpose of our research was to describe one organizations culture as it approached a bifurcation point.

We employed qualitative methods to assess the culture of a large government agency experiencing turbulence. The themes in our data suggested that individuals were relying on identities in local units rather than the organization as a whole. Organizational members were experiencing uncertainty, had lost trust, but contained anxiety with humor."
2003-0601,Priming in the Inoculation Process: An Alternative Route of Resistance to Persuasion,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Priming in the Inoculation Process: An Alternative Route of Resistance to Persuasion,"Abstract
This investigation compared established explanations for the way inoculation confers resistance and an alternative explanation based on priming. A total of 308 participants took part in the study in three phases spanning 80 days. The pattern of results indicated that inoculation treatments trigger threat; that elicited threat directly enhances Phase 2 attitude which directly fosters resistance. The results also indicated that inoculation treatments elicit anger and reduce the number of positive responses to the attack message, which, in time, directly enhance resistance to the influence of persuasive attacks. In addition, results showed that issue involvement enhances counterarguing output which, in turn, directly fosters resistance. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that inoculation treatments trigger threat; however, elicited threat neither directly nor indirectly enhances resistance. This unexpected finding may be attributed to one of the topics selected, which failed to generate a high enough threat level as was generated in previous studies. Finally, structural equation modeling didn't reveal any path between inoculation and resistance, suggesting that anger, responses to the attack message, and counterarguing output may have accounted for most of the variance in participants' resistance to the influence of persuasive attacks. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."
2003-0651,"Religion, Communication, and Social Capital",  Individual Submission type: Paper,"Religion, Communication, and Social Capital","In this study we examine the political communication processes--including discussion networks and public affairs media use--that link the associational and cognitive dimensions of religion with various indicators of social capital, including political efficacy, political trust, and social trust. We also examine differences in the linkages to indicators of social capital between white evangelical Protestants and white mainline Protestants. Using survey data from the 2000 National Election Study, our results show that current claims regarding religions ability to sponsor social capital are severely oversold. The associational effects of religion are limited, especially in comparison to the positive effects of political interactions that occur in non-church based settings. Moreover, our findings indicate that the cognitive dimension of religion fosters a retreat from certain types of communication behaviors, contributing to several negative effects on political efficacy, political trust, and social trust. Our study also confirms fears that the growing evangelical church movement may be doing damage to social capital, as evangelical Protestants are less knowledgeable of politics, less politically efficacious, and less trusting of others, after all controls."
2003-0701,Speech That Moves: The Rhetoric and Poetics of Metaphor,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Speech That Moves: The Rhetoric and Poetics of Metaphor,"This paper explores the how of metaphor's time, place, and movement as it has been considered by such philosophers as Aristotle, Paul Ricoeur, and Hayden White. Specifically the paper focuses on the constitution and operation of metaphors of time. The paper examines metaphor as a trasgression (of definition/form/class) and considers how this helps explain the potential of its potential."
2003-0751,The Affective Terrain of Adolescence: The Matrix,  Individual Submission type: Paper,The Affective Terrain of Adolescence: The Matrix,"The Matrix organizes affect. It articulates knowledge, feelings, beliefs, practices, gestures, desires, longings, colors, noises, odors, and textures. It paints the sense of the world of adolescence and the sense(s) to facilitate moving around in that world. It produces an effective terrain that can be occupied by what I call the adolescent body. Watching The Matrix is to become that body in those sensations, and through those sensations a very particular space is organized within which that body moves. The ""rubics"" of the adolescent terrain are characterized as 1) lost and found; flat and deep, 2) learning with eyes closed, 3) what the body feels, and 4) the color of love."
2003-0801,The Emergence of Structural Patterns in Interorganizational Relationships in the Application Service Provider Industry (I),  Individual Submission type: Paper,The Emergence of Structural Patterns in Interorganizational Relationships in the Application Service Provider Industry (I),"This paper examines interorganizational arrangements in the Application Service Provider Industry (ASP) that has arisen in response to technological imperatives. The study focuses on forms of interorganizational relations (IORs) and assesses the overall network patterns among ASPs during 1998-2001. The goal is to explore the underlying processes of such relations via mapping the network structure of the industry. Resource dependency theory (RDT) is utilized in the analysis of the industry. Sixty-Nine ASPs that have (within-industry) IORs with other ASPs are examined. The data analyses show that the industry is under the influence of economies of large scale and that the dominant ASPs with various IORs tend to focus on more generic type of service. Small companies should focus on provision of more specific types of services. The notion of resource dependence is discussed in relation to Giddens¡¯ theory of Structuration in theoretical interpretations of the results. In short, I argue that the notion of regularities found in structural and function approaches (such as RDT, for example) should be related to what people and organizations do in specific economic settings, rather than being related to sui-generis feature of such regularities."
2003-0851,Theorizing Vision at the Crossroads: the case of photography and digital imaging,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Theorizing Vision at the Crossroads: the case of photography and digital imaging,"Theorizing vision at the crossroads: The case of photography and digital imaging
Introduction

Common expressions such as ""photographic vision"" or ""photographic memory"" suggest an individuals possession of a special quality for detecting or recognizing truth, non-distortion, or recall of details without will or effort. Photographic vision typically is associated with the photographers special native talent for connecting expression to the minds eye.
I argue in this paper that both highly advanced and novice practitioners of photography come to participate in the discourse of photographic vision by being socialized into photography as a domain of practice which 1) guides and inhibits a particular individuals use of the ideas, spaces, and materials and 2) provides a bounded space for challenges to these guiding standards.
In an ethnographic study of a program in photography education, (1992-1995, ) I examined ways that photographic vision was cultivated through artifact mediated collective activities of definition, and how those definitions exhibit both old and new elements as the artifacts change. This argument, in the tradition of Howard Beckers (1982) book Art Worlds positions photographic vision as a discourse, and questions several assumptions about vision as a particular form of skill defined in (bounded in?) and by the individual. I build on the discussion of the relationships between artifacts and vision outlined by Charles Keller and Janet Dixon Keller in their (1999) book on blacksmithing, and by Charles Goodwin and Marjorie Harnass Goodwin writing about Professional Vision (1992).
I discuss particular kinds of photographic vision as cultivated among experts and novices learning classical chemical darkroom photography methods in a university Visual Arts department. I compare this to the kind of vision invoked by a group pioneering the first courses offered in 1992 in the same department as digital imaging emerged as aa new way to work with photography
Goodwin and Goodwins work on ""Professional Vision"" treats vision as mediated by discourse, and as situated activity. (1995, 7). Often, discussions of the role of artifacts and social contexts in shaping human experience of vision introduce data from settings that are explicitly tradition-oriented (Keller, Dixon) or where technological change is not a focal point of the analysis (Goodwin and Goodwin).
I discuss what happens to what the Goodwins call the discourses of a profession when the artifacts supporting this discourse were changing dramatically. I asked how major technological change affected the acquisition or cultivation of particular norms of interpreting vision. I chose this research setting explicitly because a major issue for its members was the problem posed by the advent of new technologies for making photographic images.
Knocking on their studio doors were vendors, students and critics questioning the primacy and centrality of the departments curricular traditions, namely the central role of black and white, wet (chemical, darkroom, analog) photography in the program. Questions about what was going to happen (is photography dying?) what decisions should be made, (should we convert our program to accommodate or emphasize digital imaging?) and how to think about new forms of practice in teaching and art making (how do you evaluate digital art?) were all around. I was interested particularly in the sorts of standards that would evolve for evaluating digital images, especially after I participated in a series of critiques of student work in black and white photography, and experienced the rituals and traditions of the arts crit.
Stability and change in the routines of visual communication is an important theme on the borderland between photography and digital image making. My paper explores this theme with respect to photographic artists' relationships to vision when and where two radically different image making technologies come into play in the nteractions of a community of students and teachers accustomed to interacting around one well established medium and method.

2003-0901,THE WHOLE WORLD IS SWEATING: Newspaper Framing of the Student Anti-Sweatshop Movement,  Individual Submission type: Paper,THE WHOLE WORLD IS SWEATING: Newspaper Framing of the Student Anti-Sweatshop Movement,"This paper examines the national newspaper coverage of the student anti-sweatshop movement on university campuses. Using coverage of this issue in three national dailies, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post, from 1995-2002, this paper explores the dominant frames used to tell this story and attempts to understand the positive representation of the student activists by the news media. This positive media attention contrasts with dominant theories about the relationship between social movements and the news media. The implications of this contrasting case for other ongoing social movements are considered."
2003-0951,Visual Representation and the Prediction of Emotion,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Visual Representation and the Prediction of Emotion,"Through content analysis of news photographs and measurement of viewers response to those images, this study explored what visual characteristics contribute to emotional responses in viewers.

We conducted a content analysis of a sample of images and measured the presence of variables hypothesized to predict emotional response. Subjects viewed sub-sets of these images and provided self-reports of their level and type of affect. The independent variables were derived from the content analysis measures. Dependent variables were viewers level of either positive or negative affect. Significant predictors of negative affect included the presence of violence, the outcomes of violence, the effects of disaster, negative emotional displays by image subjects, and unusual juxtapositions of people and/or objects. The presence of violence, unusual object juxtapositions, and negative emotional displays had significant, but negative, relationships with positive affect. Positive emotional displays, viewing the more central subjects from the front, and image subjects appearing close together significantly and directly predicted positive affect."
2004-0001,A Bibliometric Analysis of Disciplinary Self-Reflection in Communication Studies,  Individual Submission type: Paper,A Bibliometric Analysis of Disciplinary Self-Reflection in Communication Studies,"This paper reports the results of a bibliometric analysis of the patterns of co-citation among the authors most cited by the 121 articles that also refer to a special symposium issue of Journal of Communication (JoC), published in 1983, called 'Ferment in the Field.' This symposium, in attempting to make sense of the potential implications of 'critical theory' for communication studies as a field at that time, is argued to constitute a moment of 'disciplinary self-reflection' whose subsequent employment within the communication studies literature indicates the reflexive concerns of the discipline. The analysis conducted here suggests that disciplinary self-reflection in communication studies includes both epistemological-ideological and structural-functional critiques of the discipline. This analysis underscores the tensions between two views of what communication 'in the public interest' entails: on the one hand, a gimlet-eyed appraisal of the vagaries of media power; on the other, a pragmatic and useful program that contributes to policymaking and interdisciplinary inquiry."
2004-0051,A Meta-analysis of Journal Articles Intersecting Issues of Internet and Gender,  Individual Submission type: Paper,A Meta-analysis of Journal Articles Intersecting Issues of Internet and Gender,"During the past several years, the propagation and mainstream acceptance of the Internet has been a hot topic addressed in media, business, and scholarly environments. Academic journals are one source of scholarly information on the Internet, and have provided some broad research on this topic. Journals in the disciplines of communications, social sciences, and technology have addressed the various issues around Internet technology. One of the main issues of concern around the Internet has been the idea of a digital divide, or a gap in access and usage patterns based on social/cultural status, including gender, income, race, education, and age.

Internet usage of males and females in the United States has been increasing to a point of equity in recent surveys. But many studies still point to differences in usage of and representations within technology that can lead to disenfranchisement and inequity. By framing the gender gap in Internet usage as all but eliminated, continued research could be discouraged regarding gender differences beyond access and how this new type of divide is manifesting itself toward the potential of Internet. This study looks at the evolution of articles that deal with the gender implications of the Internet in journals in the fields of communications, gender studies, and technology and society."

Only the perception is measured whether important others would approve or disapprove it if a person performs a certain behavior. However, more types of social influence can be discerned and it is hypothesized that the conceptualization of the social factor should be broadened. A typology of social influences on smoking cessation is outlined and is tested on 2,703 Dutch smokers. This study shows that several social factors influence the intention to quit smoking. These effects are not completely mediated by the variables of the theory of planned behavior. The consequences for health campaign strategies are described. Most likely, the same holds for other behaviors as well, but the relative importance of the various social influences varies dependent on the behavior and population under study."
2004-0151,Can U.S. Entertainment TV Programs InfluenceThe Culture Of Young Adults Overseas?,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Can U.S. Entertainment TV Programs InfluenceThe Culture Of Young Adults Overseas?,"Shortly after the September 11 terrorist attack, the U.S. government began wondering what can be done to influence the attitudes toward the U.S. of the wary and sometimes angry Muslim youth abroad. During the month of November 2001, news reports revealed that the U.S. government, together with Hollywood executives, had determined that this objective could be achieved by:

1. Exporting such entertainment networks as MTV to the Muslim parts of the world;
2. Establishing American AM-FM radio stations specifically targeting Muslim youth; and
3. Beaming American television programs via a newly established satellite-based television network that will compete with Al-Jazeera, a TV network that became very visible after September 11 due to its ubiquity in the Arab world.

This paper asks: Can imported TV programs influence the local audiences who watch them? If so, then what is the process of influence that is at work? And who are the audience members most likely to be influenced by the foreign TV shows?

This paper presents the results of an integrated theoretical model stemming from a research program devoted to this very topic."
2004-0201,Contesting Narratives of Workplace Maternity,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Contesting Narratives of Workplace Maternity,"Our paper situates discourses and practices of workers, paid work, and wellness within contemporary organizational imperatives. Through a case study of a woman whose ability to work was compromised by complications associated with pregnancy, we show that maternity in the workplace is connected with deviance, sexuality, the feminine, unreliability, illness, and disability. To promote change, organizational and health communication researchers must construct multiple creative narratives about pregnancy in the workplace and maternity leave that decenter the master narrative and replace it with stories rendering bodily variation as normal."
2004-0251,Dialogic Development and the Elusive Digital Divide: European Union's Alliance for Information Society in Latin America,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Dialogic Development and the Elusive Digital Divide: European Union's Alliance for Information Society in Latin America,"With a dual understanding of the digital divide  as signifier for uneven IT access and use, but also for re-mapped political and economic boundaries in the Information Age, this paper examines the discursive construction of the term as introduced by the European Unions Alliance for the Information Society with Latin America (@lis). The juxtaposition of the need to bridge the digital divide with calls for liberalization of Internet markets prompts a peculiar conceptualization of the phenomenon itself  as a knowledge rather than an access gap, and as a result, poses certain questions about the ways in which power and control are re-articulated via such development programs. Drawing on a Marxist framework that exposes the exclusionary dimension of liberalization policies, I point to the emergence of a hybrid discourse, where the digital divide is simultaneously addressed and produced. Specifically, I suggest that, while @lis responds to the issue of an international digital divide, its intended modus operandi harbors the possibility for domestic divides, and therefore, the reproduction of inequalities in local contexts."
2004-0301,Efffects of Sex and Proxemics on Perceptions of Leadership,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Efffects of Sex and Proxemics on Perceptions of Leadership,"Regarding the use of heuristics to form opinions about leadership, past research has found that nonverbal cues can influence how we think of a particular person as possessing leadership qualities, with perceptions of women as leaders influenced by gender stereotypes that counter traditional ideas relating leadership with masculinity. Two experiments were conducted to explore the effects of persons sex and seating arrangement on subjects perceptions of leadership. Results conflict with prior findings indicating gender bias against women: Subjects chose a person shown seated at the head of the table as the leader of a group regardless of that persons sex. Findings indicate that perceptions of leadership might be changing, with the nonverbal cue of seating arrangement serving as a more important heuristic in the determination of a groups leader."
2004-0351,First- and Third-Person Perceptions of HIV/AIDS messages and HIV/AIDS prevention in Zambia,  Individual Submission type: Paper,First- and Third-Person Perceptions of HIV/AIDS messages and HIV/AIDS prevention in Zambia,"Preventing the spread of HIV and promoting HIV testing has become paramount to the survival of Africa nations such as Zambia. Communication campaigns to prevent the spread of HIV and to promote testing are abundant, yet not enough Zambians have adopted the promoted behaviors, and as a result, the spread of HIV continues to rise. Researchers must examine how individuals respond to campaign messages within a cultural context to inform the use of such campaigns in promoting health behavior change. This paper examines the extent to which HIV prevention and testing behaviors are predicated on the perceptual gap, which is the difference in the estimated impact of messages on the self versus others. The behavioural hypothesis of the third person perception suggests the perceptual gap is a better predictor of peoples behaviors than their exposure to media messages. In a collectivistic culture, the notion of the third person perception and the behavioural hypothesis take on particular importance. In a study of the impact of HIV/AIDS messages on 344 Zambian college students, I examine first- and third-person perceptions of HIV/AIDS messages, focusing on the differences in the estimated impact of the messages in Public Service Announcements (PSAs) versus those presented within a local serial drama. I also examine the perceptual gap, message exposure and other important health behavior change concepts as predictors of condom use and intentions and HIV testing and intentions, examining sex differences. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

News making is not random but patterned and socially conditioned systems for the reproduction of knowledge, which fits well with the existing power structures in U.S. society. Especially given the growing power of the corporate mainstream media in the United States, this research examines the ideological functions of news medias ""classifying out the world"" (Hall, 1978) and ""definitional control"" (Schiller, 2000). It explores the systematic news framing process, in which some occurrences are selected, given meaning, and made more salient. This study analyzes U.S. newspapers framing of the AIDS situation in Africa, in relation to drug patents there, within the context of widespread global information imbalances. The relationship between Africas AIDS situation and international regulations on drug patents is highly significant, due to the fact that formerly colonized countries are largely excluded from the benefits of scientific innovations due to the reinforcing of a ""postcolonial hierarchy,"" in terms of both world information flows and economy.
This research conceptualizes public health, specifically Africas AIDS -- the site of more than two-thirds of the worlds HIV-infected people -- as a social and historical construct bounded by postcolonial globalization. By applying such critical concepts as ""hegemony"", intellectual authority, ""habitus,"" and ""symbolic power to news framing analysis, this work examines how the AIDS-drug patent issue has been culturally and socially constructed through news discourse. It criticizes the ways in which such news reporting in mainstream U.S. newspapers depicts these complex issues and compares this reporting with alternative medias treatment of those issues."
2004-0451,Internationalism In Times of Hate: Anti-Racist Campaigns in European Football and in the USA After September 11,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Internationalism In Times of Hate: Anti-Racist Campaigns in European Football and in the USA After September 11,"This paper uses as its point of departure Iriyes conceptualization and history of internationalism to make the case that campaigns to discursively construct an internationalist ethic have become a popular means of responding to international crises deemed to originate in racial hatred and ethnocentrism. The two case studies being compared are those of Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) and the American Ad Council. Iriye defines internationalism as an idea, a movement, or an institution that seeks to reformulate the nature of relations among nations through cross-national cooperation and interchange (Iriye, 1997, p. 3). The specific form of internationalism called cultural internationalism Iriye defines as a variety of activities undertaken to link countries and peoples through the exchange of ideas and persons, through scholarly cooperation, or through efforts at facilitating cross-national understanding. Cultural internationalists believe that such activities maintain international peace. Iriye says the phenomenon originated in the late 1800s in North America and Europe to counteract the seemingly endless preoccupation of the great powers with military strengthening and colonial domination. Its popularity as an ethic has steadily grown over the last 100 years, and the most visible examples of that include the League of Nations, the United Nations system, and the growth in a number of practices, such as international student exchanges and international professional associations and conferences. However, the persistence of international war and inter-ethnic violence and other forms of hostility show that internationalism is still very much a work in progress. For its supporters it is an essential ethic if there is to be world peace. It has been the theme of mass media and education campaigns created in the wake of racial conflict that has plagued European football in recent years and of those media campaigns in the United States after the 2001 terror attacks. However, this paper scrutinizes the dynamic of how these campaigns are conceived and executed to question whether the motivation for such projects is mass persuasion (conversion of a mass of people to the logic of internationalism) or mass symbolism (demonstrating to the mass public that the sponsoring entity is itself not racist). The paucity of academic effects research on mass persuasion campaigns to change racial attitudes, the haste in launching such campaigns, and the failure to base such campaigns on in-depth planning are among the factors isolated for careful attention. This paper is part of the second phase of a multi-year project on the role of strategic communication programs in international relations. The first phase ran from 1998 to 2002 and resulted in the book Global Lies? Propaganda, the UN and World Order (London: Palgrave-Macmillan, 2003)  the first comprehensive analysis of the origins and ecology of the United Nations' public information program conducted by a scholar independent of the United Nations Secretariat."

Instruction was provided as a regular part of classroom instruction in English language arts by seven regular classroom teachers. Statistically significant differences were found in three measures of students critical thinking skills as they analyzed a print alcohol ad. Students in the treatment group showed higher scores measuring the ability to identify target audience, to describe construction techniques used to attract and hold attention, and to identify the implied message subtext. Compared to the control group, students in the media literacy condition also had greater knowledge of the pre-production and post-production components of the advertising production process."
2004-0551,Michel Foucault and Confessions of Jewishness in Post-1967 Israeli Cinema,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Michel Foucault and Confessions of Jewishness in Post-1967 Israeli Cinema,"In this paper, I examine the representations of religious identity in post-1967 Israeli cinema. More specifically, I explore the social and cultural conditions within Israeli society that made the discursive construction of Jewishness central to the struggle for power. In so doing, I will apply Michel Foucaults work in The History of Sexuality, Volume I on the incitement to discourse. Whereas in the previous, Statist dominated era, Israeliness was measured in terms of quasi-religious devotion to the state and difference was ascribed to those groups who refused to sublimate their traditional or religious definitions of Judaism to the Zionist cause, Israel in the late 1960s and 1970s featured a less hierarchical system of power, with less repressive measures imposed on difference, where citizenship was discursively compelled to confess itself through its relationship to its Jewishness and this, in turn, became the terrain on which power was struggled over. As with other institutions, the media became a site of struggle where Jewishness was both compelled to confess itself and where resistance could be mounted via these same techniques of power. The incitement to confess ones Jewishness became both a means of subjugation and a source of identity politics for those forced to confess. As in the Statist period, Mizrachi Jews were the primary targets of the confessional technique, though now, for the first time, orthodox Jews also began to be recognized and interrogated."
2004-0601,Organizational Assimilation and Communication Technology Use,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Organizational Assimilation and Communication Technology Use,"Studies of organizational members socialization information-seeking have focused on traditional channels for uncertainty reduction (e.g., face-to-face communication and traditional technologies like employee handbooks) and on the experiences of newcomers. This investigation extends organizational socialization research by examining a variety of socialization experiences (not just those of newcomers) and considering Advanced Communication and Information Technology (ACIT) as an additional channel for socialization-related information. This study explored the relationship between three channels for information-seeking (face-to-face communication, traditional media, and ACIT) and perceived socialization effectiveness. Predictors of employee selection and use of ACITs also were examined, including perceptions of media richness and social presence, and user responses to their technology experiences were assessed among 405 employees of four organizations. Face-to-face communication is the most important predictor of assimilation effectiveness, followed by ACIT use. Least important are traditional technologies. Media characteristics, as elucidated in two prominent theories of organizational communication technology use, predicted individuals selection and use of ACITs. Finally, a typology of members behavioral responses to feedback regarding their ACIT use was derived, which revealed that users respond by continuing current practices, supplementing the channel, discontinuing use, expanding use, or learning new uses-or implement a variety of these."
2004-0651,Pour Some Sugar On Me: Nutritional Content of Foods Advertised During the Television Programs Children Watch Most,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Pour Some Sugar On Me: Nutritional Content of Foods Advertised During the Television Programs Children Watch Most,"This paper summarizes a content analysis of 426 food advertisements collected during the spring of 2003 from 40 hours of television programming popular with children ages 6-11. Type of food, health claims, meal status, eating locale, and character attributes were coded. In addition, nutritional information for advertised foods was obtained via the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Nutrition Facts label, which has been mandatory on food packaging since May 8, 1994. Snack foods were advertised more frequently than meal foods, and the most frequently represented food categories were convenience foods, sweets, and soft drinks. The most nutritionally unsound foods were found in advertisements aimed specifically at children. Following a 2000-calorie-per-day diet composed entirely of these foods, a child would consume 130 percent of her daily limit of saturated fat, 124 percent of her daily sodium, and 180 grams (almost a cup) of refined sugar, but only 36 percent of her daily fiber and about half of her recommended daily dose of vitamin A. Discussion focuses on the status of foods advertised to general versus child audiences."

This paper reviews previous third person effect and question order effect studies and then discusses underlying process of question order effect which may provide a theoretical bridge between question order effect and third person effect. Finally, the paper suggests a new approach to understand the relationship between question order effect and third person effect based on the attitude construal perspective."
2004-0751,Senses of Humor: The Validation of a Multi-factor Scale,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Senses of Humor: The Validation of a Multi-factor Scale,"To further understand individual differences in mass communication effects, this paper focuses on the development, testing, and validation of a humor appreciation scale. Several conceptual propositions are forwarded, including that humor appreciation is a multidimensional constructi.e., multiple senses of humor are possible. Data from three surveystwo student surveys and a general population survey--are examined, with results indicating that sense of humor may properly be viewed as multidimensional, and emergent humor dimensions may be validated with preferences for particular media content. Findings are compared to the initial set of propositions, and the usefulness of senses of humor as a communication trait is explored."
2004-0801,Televised debates and the public interest. Dysfunctional effects of televised debates on voters' knowledge of the state of the country,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Televised debates and the public interest. Dysfunctional effects of televised debates on voters' knowledge of the state of the country,"Televised debates are supposed to provide voters with political information that helps them to decide on a rational basis whom to vote for. Many studies have shown that voters do in fact learn from what is said during debates, e.g. about the positions advocated or the importance of political issues. Therefore, many researchers regard televised debates a useful feature of political campaign communication. What is not investigated in these studies, however, is the extent to which televised debates actually enhance voters' knowledge. We argue in this paper that a differentiation between learning effects (e.g. being able to repeat candidates' descriptions of the state of the country) and knowledge effects (improving understanding of the state of the country) is necessary because what people learn in televised debates might not necessarily leave them with a better basis for a rational voting decision.

In order to investigate that, we surveyed a sample of 75 voters immediately before, during, immediately after and five days after the second televised debate before the 2002 German national election. During the debate, viewers' reactions were measured using a real-time response measurement system (RTR). In the surveys, participants were asked to assess Germany's economic situation as compared to (a) the situation before the last national election in 1998 and (b) to other European countries. Our analysis shows substantial learning effects among viewers. But that does not mean that they improved their knowledge. In fact, knowledge about unemployment was actually worse after the debate among a substantial number of viewers. They were obviously misled by the candidates' selective presentation of facts. This means that televised debates sometimes can even reduce the knowledge of voters."
2004-0851,The Effectiveness of Retrospective and Anticipatory Self-referencing Ads,  Individual Submission type: Paper,The Effectiveness of Retrospective and Anticipatory Self-referencing Ads,"This study explores the effectiveness of retrospective and anticipatory self-referencing ads. The findings of this study show that individual differences in terms of femininity and masculinity can moderate the effectiveness of retrospective and anticipatory self-referencing ads and lead to either self-congruency or self-enhancement effects. Specifically, the findings suggest that feminine participants prefer ads that invite retrospective self-referencing to ads that encourage anticipatory self-referencing. The reverse pattern, on the other hand, has been found for masculine participants. In addition, this study shows that when participants are exposed to retrospective self-referencing ads, both feminine and masculine participants express a preference for ads that depict congruent self-images over those that depict incongruent self-images, exhibiting what is referred to in the literature as a self-congruency effect. In clear contrast, when exposed to anticipatory self-referencing ads, both feminine and masculine participants react more positively to ads that depict masculine traits -- traits that are believed to be associated with positive values -- than to those that portray feminine values, suggesting what is referred to as a self-enhancement effect."
2004-0901,The Internet as a Public Sphere,  Individual Submission type: Paper,The Internet as a Public Sphere,"This paper is an analysis of online discussion sections based on Jurgen Habermas theory of the public sphere. Using the key concepts of the theory of the public sphere, this paper examines discussion sections of three different web sites to see if they can be called as promising electronic public spheres, where constructive public discourses could occur. The selected discussion sections are: Online Community at www.oprah.com, The Opinion at www.theopinion.com, and Waking Life Forums at www.wakinglifemovie.com. In the analysis, the advantages and disadvantages of a virtual space in forming a public discourse are discussed. The needs of a mediator or a filtering system are further discussed at the end of the paper."
2004-0951,The Rise and Fall of Online Social Support: Group Level Predictors,  Individual Submission type: Paper,The Rise and Fall of Online Social Support: Group Level Predictors,"The sustainability of online social support groups is an important issue: The more new members are attracted and the more old members remain, the more benefits can be created through their communication for current and future participants. However, little attention has been given to the sustainability of online social support groups in the information systems and the communication literature. The present study tested a structural-functional model of online social support group (OSSG) sustainability with 116 OSSGs. Structurally, significant non-linear effects of group size and message volume on attraction rate and message increase rate were found. Group age and no-posting-period negatively affected OSSG sustainability. Functionally, symmetry was found increasing retention rate. The proportion of emotional social support comments significantly increased retention rate in physical illness groups, but not in mental illness groups. Primary results were discussed with secondary analyses, followed by practical implications of the findings and limitations for future research."
2004-1001,Toward the Philosophy of Public Relations in South Korea,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Toward the Philosophy of Public Relations in South Korea,"Since public relations was introduced to South Korea about five decades ago, it has grown and as a popular industry. However, the philosophy and values of public relations has not recognized, and the general population often have negative connotation about the profession. Based on the normative role and definition of public relations, I attempt to develop a philosophy of public relations in South Korea by exploring the body of knowledge of public relations, the history and current situation of the public relations in South Korea, and traditional Korean philosophy and cultural values. I suggest three values, dialogue and two-way communication, public interest, and openness and transparency, as foundation for the contemporary philosophy of public relations in the country."
2004-1051,Virtual Democratic Possibilities: Creating and Sustaining Informed Opinion Through Online and Face-to-Face Deliberative Polling,  Individual Submission type: Paper,Virtual Democratic Possibilities: Creating and Sustaining Informed Opinion Through Online and Face-to-Face Deliberative Polling,"This paper examines evidence from two parallel Deliberative Polls with representative national samples, one conducted face-to-face and the other conducted online. In both cases we investigate the impact of citizen deliberation on levels of knowledge and changes in opinion on foreign policy issues. Both the online and face-to-face polls had their own control groups that did not deliberate. We examine the differences in mode between online and face-to-face discussion, and their effects on opinion change and on political efficacy.
The online project is distinctive for a) overcoming the digital divide through the provision of computers to those respondents in the sample who did not have them b) overcoming the literacy divide through the provision of microphones so that the dialogue could be conducted verbally rather than through the exchange of text. c) its extension in time to cover the period both before and after the Iraq war. This extended period of deliberation allows us to examine whether it may be possible to approach effects online that are comparable to those achieved face-to-face over the intense but short period of a weekend.
We locate our results in the context of an ongoing debate in the field of public opinion. In our view, informed public opinion differs substantially from ""top of the head"" opinion in any given issue domain. Moreover, contrary to the conventional wisdom, our results suggest that so-called ""heuristics"" do not allow ordinary (i.e. uninformed) citizens to approximate the voting and policy preferences they would adopt if they were more informed."
