2007-0001,2008 Summer Games: Beijings Image Campaign,Chinas Olympic Makeover: Shaping Chinas Global Image via the 2008 Beijing Olympics,,,,Paper,2008 Summer Games: Beijings Image Campaign,Chinas Olympic Makeover: Shaping Chinas Global Image via the 2008 Beijing Olympics,"China is preparing for what is expected to be the most expensive and possibly the most profitable Olympics on record. A crucial aspect of a successful Olympics is a compelling and coherent set of Olympic images and symbols that appeals to domestic and international audiences. However, the strategic designs of 2008 Olympics can also be seen as representative of the ways in which China would like to define itself to its citizens and the world.

This paper focuses on the symbols, mottos, and images of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It especially analyses Beijings Olympic mascots: The Five Friendlies. The paper examines the design process for the mascots and other Olympic images, as well as the cultural and historical qualities represented in the designs. Of particular concern are the economic, political, and social implications embodied by the images, mascots and logos of the 2008 Games as China advertises itself domestically and internationally through these images."
2007-0002,30 Years of Public Relations Scholarship: A Census of Our Research Methods,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,30 Years of Public Relations Scholarship: A Census of Our Research Methods,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,"This systematic review of research published in two scholarly public relations journals offers an introspective analysis of research methods used during the past 30 years. This study was inspired by two debates historically rooted in the publishing of public relations research: 1) application versus theory building, and 2) use of quantitative versus qualitative methods. A census of research published from 1975-2005 in Public Relations Review (n=787) revealed use of quantitative methods in 270 articles (34.3%) and qualitative methods in 489 articles (62.1%). During the 1989-2005 time period, Journal of Public Relations Research (n=213) published studies that used quantitative methods in 97 articles (45.5%) and qualitative methods in 92 articles (43.2%). Use of research methods over time and use of combined/multiple methods also was examined. Finally, recommendations are offered to authors regarding technique and methodological choices."
2007-0003,"Abbreviation, Audience, and Gender in iTV SMS Chat",Promises and Problems of the Chat Generation,,,,Paper,"Abbreviation, Audience, and Gender in iTV SMS Chat",Promises and Problems of the Chat Generation,"A distinctive feature of Short Message Service (SMS) mobile phone messages in various languages is the use of non-standard, abbreviated typography. Previous research on computer-mediated communication (CMC), including SMS, has also identified differences according to user gender. This paper reports a study of non-standard typography, in particular shortenings, in relation to gender of users in SMS messages sent to a public Italian interactive television (iTV) channel. A quantitative comparison of SMS in three languagesItalian, English and Germanwas also carried out to show that shortenings are an integral part of non-standard SMS typography, regardless of language and the public/private audience dimension. The results shed light on SMS usage across languages as well as the increasingly popular phenomenon of iTV SMS chat."
2007-0004,"A Bridge Across the Bosphorous: Returned Migrants, Their Internet and Media Use, and Social Capital",Articulating Home and Belonging: Mapping the Diaspora and its Experiences,,,,Paper,"A Bridge Across the Bosphorous: Returned Migrants, Their Internet and Media Use, and Social Capital",Articulating Home and Belonging: Mapping the Diaspora and its Experiences,"Relatively few studies have focused on migrants who returned to the country of their origin or their parents origin. Still fewer have examined the communication patterns of call center workers who live in one country but conduct all of their business in the language and culture of another country. Drawing on work by Portes and Bourdieu, this study treats the use of traditional media and the Internet and its relation to the bridging and bonding behavior of a group of Turks who returned to Istanbul from the Netherlands, and who are now employed by a Dutch call center company. Based on a survey and three focus groups of employee participants, this research finds that more recent and younger returnees primarily bond with family and friends in Holland through use of Dutch media and Internet use, while longer-term returnees connect more with Turkish media. Some bridging was occurring through interpersonal communication with Turks by the younger and more recent arrivals."
2007-0005,A Burkean Analysis of Stability and Change: Structure and Symbol in the Use of the Term Platform,Explaining Technologies,,,,Paper,A Burkean Analysis of Stability and Change: Structure and Symbol in the Use of the Term Platform,Explaining Technologies,"In this essay, we complete a rhetorical analysis of the term platform. In 6 interviews from Norway and the United States, interviewees voluntarily mentioned platforms in descriptions of their specific jobs and the role of Information/Communication/Technologies (ICTs) in the workplace. We compare these 6 cases by plotting them in a table that displays the organizational parameters of stability and change as compared to Kenneth Burkes features of structure and symbol. This comparison shows that platform is used, both technically and metaphorically, to demonstrate competence in a changing field of knowledge, as well as a desire for more strict commitment to human discipline."
2007-0006,A Case Study of Boundary and Identity Management in a Virtual Team,Teams: Virtual and Otherwise,,,,Paper,A Case Study of Boundary and Identity Management in a Virtual Team,Teams: Virtual and Otherwise,"Guided by the bona fide group theory, this case study examined how a virtual team socially constructed and reinforced its groups boudaries and evolved a group identity in elecontrically mediated interaction. The group faced the challenge of blurring boudaries as a result of overlapping responsibilities with interlocking groups. In addition, the members experienced dialectal tensions in face of the permeability of group boundaries. The study explained how the group managed those tensions through its communication practices, some of which preserved the group boundaries. Moreover, the members experienced significant identity shift as reflected by shifting patterns and norms of group interaction."
2007-0007,A Case Study of Why Local Reporting Matters: Photojournalism Framing of the Response to Hurricane Katrina in Local and National Newspapers,Race and Ethnicity in Risk Situations,,,,Paper,A Case Study of Why Local Reporting Matters: Photojournalism Framing of the Response to Hurricane Katrina in Local and National Newspapers,Race and Ethnicity in Risk Situations,"This study examines the framing of the response to hurricane Katrina in local and national newspapers as part of a broader study of the importance of localism in media markets.

Gandy and Lee studied the photojournalism record presented in the New York Times and The Washington Post with a concern that American photojournalists followed a traditional template used by the Western press when it covers periodic disasters in the Third World. Observers suggest that many of the images of the disaster in New Orleans looked very similar to the images of American doctors and marines rescuing the starving desperate victims. But Gandy and Lee did not have extensive data on the underlying reality of the events in New Orleans. This Study uses the photojournalism record of the hometown papers as a baseline  The Times Picayune and the Sun Herald, both of which won Pulitzer Prizes for their coverage.

We find that the national papers simplified the situation and exaggerated the role of victims; depicted many more passive black victims in New Orleans and one of the papers reported many more negative actions by Blacks. At the same time, we find a uniform absence of Black rescuers across all papers, particularly in National Guard Units, that raises questions about the racial make-up of these units and their deployment, beyond the issue of photojournalism.

The findings underscore the importance of local sources of news. Even though distribution through a new medium such as the Internet may make sources more readily available, it is the original local reporting that is the key."

2007-0009,A Click in Time: How Values Shape Media Choices Within Generations,Trends in Media Choice and Use,,,,Paper,A Click in Time: How Values Shape Media Choices Within Generations,Trends in Media Choice and Use,"This paper explores the nexus between media technology and changing value systems from a generational perspective to examine how they might intersect one another in everyday life, specifically in the context of family life. Given that values ultimately influence behavioral decisions, be they related to media use or not, this paper argues that a meaningful way to assess behavioral decisions is to examine them by looking not only at the outcome choice (e.g. the decision to play a video game versus surf the web), but examine what value might have fed into that outcome choice (e.g. the desire to attain a sense of accomplishment versus pure enjoyment), within the context of the users generational membership (e.g. parents versus children). Using a multi-method approach (including focus groups, peer interviews, in-home ethnogaphies, and long-term deprivation), this research explores the values central to parents and kids and how those values dirve their media choices and behaviors."

2007-0011,A Communication Metamyth Revisited: Is More Communication in the Workplace Better?,"Examining the Old, Creating the New",,,,Paper,A Communication Metamyth Revisited: Is More Communication in the Workplace Better?,"Examining the Old, Creating the New","This article explores the use of the communication audit as a tool for understanding and diagnosing communication in organizational settings. Previous audit-driven research supports the notion that organizations exhibit stable, predictable outcomes associated with communication involving issues such as perceptions of information received and information desired. This project reports on the analysis of communication audit data from 4 different kinds of organizations and considers how the results of communication audits might be interpreted."
2007-0012,A Communication Perspective on Video Lottery Gambling,cial Interaction Processes and Practices in Health and Mental Health,,,,Paper,A Communication Perspective on Video Lottery Gambling,Social Interaction Processes and Practices in Health and Mental Health,"Video Lottery Gambling (VLG) is more strongly associated with pathological gambling than any other type of lottery game. Furthermore, only 10% of individuals having problems with VLG have requested assistance. However, VLG gambling is a rather recent social phenomenon and indicates methodological and ethical difficulties for its study, which could explain that there is very little data about the psychosocial and communicational dimensions of VLG. The embeddedness of a person in his or her social networks is among the communicational factors that may have an impact on his behavior. To verify this for VLG gamblers, we sought to compare the characteristics of the ego networks of VLG gamblers, of gamblers in other types of lottery games with low requests for assistance and of VLG gamblers in treatment (seeking help). To reach this goal, we interviewed 90 gamblers (30 for each group). The results show that ego networks of regular and active VLG gamblers are very small (11.2 links on average) and dense. These gamblers receive little social support from their network. In comparison, those in treatment also have a small network (13 links on average), but it is less dense, has more components, and offers more social support. On the other hand, ego networks of gamblers with low requests for assistance (bingo) are approximately twice the size as those of VLG gamblers (25.8 links on average), are more sparse and have many relationships that offer companionship. In conclusion, the regular VLG gambler is not an isolated individual, but rather an individual ""shut-in"" a small network of tight relations."
2007-0013,A Communicative Analysis of South and North Korean Conflict: From Political Conflict to Communication Conflict,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,A Communicative Analysis of South and North Korean Conflict: From Political Conflict to Communication Conflict,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,"South and North Korea have been separated for more than fifty years, yet both countries still claim that they comprise one ethnic group. However, there are few explicit reasons that support why they should be considered as one ethnic group. Indeed, since two Koreas have different political and economic systems and there is no communication between each other, the ethnic group has become fractured. Language is particularly important in communication because it creates, maintains, and even disconnects most types of human relationships. From this perspective, it is doubtable that South and North Koreans would speak the same language after the fifty years of separation. What does this language difference mean in the relationship between the two Koreas? It means that the two Koreas are losing the final tie that connects the two groups of people. The two Koreas are now at the moment of becoming completely disconnected and becoming different ethnic groups. In confronting this situation, the communicative conflict resolutions can be the most effective way to reestablish a holistic relationship between the two Koreas. The communicative conflict resolution for the Korean conflict includes constructing more agendas to create more interpersonal and organizational interactions, exchanging popular culture by media, and integrating a common language policy. These communicative strategies of enhancing the relationship between the two Koreas focus more on the grassroots level of interactions, rather than the political and economic sectors."
2007-0014,A Comparative Analysis of Comments Used in News Coverage of the Wars in Iraq,Creating Perspective With Words,,,,Paper,A Comparative Analysis of Comments Used in News Coverage of the Wars in Iraq,Creating Perspective With Words,"This paper is one in a series of three papers examining critics complaints concerning the use of entertainment and marketing techniques in news coverage of the Iraq war. A content analysis comparing the use of comments made in the early Gulf war coverage to the use of comments made in the early Iraq war coverage is conducted. The results indicate that many of the critics complaints may indeed be accurate as there has been a significant shift in the use of commentary between the Gulf coverage and the Iraq coverage that increases emphasis on the parasocial relationship with the audience, the description of war as a game, and the focus on the news coverage itself."
2007-0015,A Comparison of Male and Female Directors in Pornography: What Happens When Women Are at the Helm?,Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,A Comparison of Male and Female Directors in Pornography: What Happens When Women Are at the Helm?,Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Pornography is a lucrative business with an annual revenue of 12 billion dollars, a 160-fold increase since 1985. Although pornography is still mainly a man's world  produced by and for men  there has been an increase in female participation, both as audience members and as directors and producers. This current study takes on an inquiry that has never been studied before: does the content in popular pornographic videos and films that has been created by female directors differ from that of their male counterparts? And, if so, how is it different? These questions are addressed in the current study of the content features of top-renting adult videos in 2005, as identified in Adult Video News, by both male and female directors. Results show these popular pornographic videos almost always portray females as victims, expressing pleasure when they are aggressed against. Compared to male directors, female directors' videos contain a significantly greater frequency of both physical and verbal aggressive instances."

2007-0017,A Critical Discourse Analysis of Representation of Asian Indian Folktales in U.S. Childrens Literature,"Mediating Culture: Ethnicity, Race, and Cultural Representations in Popular Texts",,,,Paper,A Critical Discourse Analysis of Representation of Asian Indian Folktales in U.S. Childrens Literature,"Mediating Culture: Ethnicity, Race, and Cultural Representations in Popular Texts","This study explores the representation of India in U.S. childrens picture books in attempting to understand what picture of India is becoming accessible to American children as they are growing up and how this picture shapes the childs perception about India and Indian people. All books pertaining to India (in all 13) from a small town library in the Pacific Northwest of America were analyzed for this study. Almost all the 13 books were published in the 1990s except for two, one of which was published in 1961 and one which was originally published before 1935. Three areas of the books were analyzed  the titles, the illustrations and the text. The primary categories identified during the analysis were nature and wild animals, poverty and hardship, spiritual hermits, and wit and common sense wisdom.
The critical discourse analysis revealed that there is a continuation of reproduction of the hierarchical relations of race, gender, and nation articulated in Euroamerican colonial ideologies in the sample studied. The books maintain popular expectations about India that are dictated by colonial stereotypes, the discomfort in approaching multiculturalism in the United Statea and the concept of the other which is socially, temporally and spatially removed from the here and now. The discourses in these books help in creating a one-way history of progress, development and modernity of the Western society as opposed to their negative mirror images like, stagnation, underdevelopment and traditional in the other world, in this case India."
2007-0018,A Cross-Cultural Investigation of Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Effects of Anger and Compassion on Multistage Negotiation Performance,Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,,,,Paper,A Cross-Cultural Investigation of Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Effects of Anger and Compassion on Multistage Negotiation Performance,Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,"Over the past two decades, the role of emotion in negotiation has attracted considerable attention from negotiation scholars. The vast majority of emotion-in-negotiation studies, however, were conducted using western samples. Most studies ignored the nonindependent nature of dyadic data and focused only on the intrapersonal effect of emotion. To extend current understanding of emotion in negotiation, this study investigates both intrapersonal and interpersonal effects of anger and compassion on negotiation performance through dyadic data analyses and a cross-cultural research design. Participants (N = 134) were 70 Chinese and 64 American students who were paired up to form 67 intracultural negotiation dyads and completed 2 negotiation tasks. At different points of the simulation, participants responded to a self-reported questionnaire that assessed (a) their attribution of responsibility and perceived emotions, (b) their individual and joint gains from the two negotiations, and (c) their perceived satisfaction and desire to work with each other in the future. Findings from this study suggested (a) participants anger and compassion had both a significant intrapersonal and a significant interpersonal effect on individual gains (b) compassion had a significant influence on joint gains, (c) although the effects of anger and compassion on tangible negotiation outcomes disappeared as negotiators moved on to a second negotiation, they had a relatively lasting effect on intangible outcomes, and (d) the influence of anger and compassion on negotiation performance did not vary by national culture or bargaining role. Theoretical implications of the study are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research."
2007-0019,"Action Research, Dialogue, and the American Mosque",Alternative Voices: Investigating Discourses About and Within Islam and the Middle East,,,,Paper,"Action Research, Dialogue, and the American Mosque",Alternative Voices: Investigating Discourses About and Within Islam and the Middle East,"When a community is in transition, higher levels of uncertainty and chaos are perceived as threats or conflicts by some and as new opportunities by others. After 9-11 a research question was posed to understand how to increase unity and support positive growth in complex American Muslim communities using techniques of community-based action research. The researcher acted as a facilitator inviting community members to participate as co-researchers focused on positive community change. Through a series of in-depth interviews and analysis, deeper understandings emerged as more community members joined the dialogue. Topics for inter-Islamic dialogue included questions of cultural, power, and other differences of opinion that might affect human relationships and modes of interaction during change. Questions focused on creating a more inclusive atmosphere for people who may perceive themselves as marginalized and silenced by the dominant culture(s). This research engages with the meeting of worldviews in the American mosque: when collectivism meets individualism and tradition meets conviction."
2007-0020,"Activist Networks, Sovereignty and the Postnational Constellation",Communication and Sovereignty: Dislocations and Relocations,,,,Paper,"Activist Networks, Sovereignty and the Postnational Constellation",Communication and Sovereignty: Dislocations and Relocations,"The idea that national sovereignty has been eroding due to forces and relations of global production and trade is now commonplace. Consistent with that view is the widespread acknowledgement of the spread and influence of the means and processes of transnational communication. This paper will examine the bases and assumptions on which claims are made that national sovereignty has declined, with particular attention to media and communication processes related to transnational activism. Two arguments that the paper will make are, first, that it is necessary to distinguish between more and less powerful states, since in doing so we can clearly see that powerful states surrender less sovereignty than weaker ones. Second, it is important to recognize how even powerful states are forced to become responsive to the public communication efforts of transnational activist networks. Such networks can often be characterized by a combination of flexibility, speed and opportunism in their communication strategies. They often make no distinctions between state power and transnational (or postnational) alignments, but instead focus their energies primarily on issues, choosing points of intervention  be they subnational, national, or transnational  according to what is considered likely to be the most effective strategy for achieving desired goals. Such networks do not view sovereignty as irrelevant, but nor do they limit their intervention strategies to national scales. These themes will be explored through two case studies that illustrate communication strategies that recognize, but are not defined by, national sovereignty. One deals with global anti-sweatshop networks, and the other with global efforts to improve access to drugs for HIV/AIDS patients."
2007-0021,"Activists Playing a Dual Role: Identities, Organizational Goals, and Public Relations Practices",Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,"Activists Playing a Dual Role: Identities, Organizational Goals, and Public Relations Practices",Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,"This study explores the relationships among identities, goals, and public relations practices of activist organizations. Based on in-depth interviews with 11 participants (6 staff members and 5 board members) from a single activist group, results of the study indicate that (1) the activist organization manifests different levels of its identity in communication with different audiences; particularly, the organization identifies itself differently as compared to the perception of its target organizations; (2) in playing its dual role (as public to its target organizations and public communicator to its publics), the organization intends to act as an honest representative voice as well as a credible source of information connecting its publics and target organizations; it is very critical to find a balance position between the two parties, a position compatible with the organizations mission; and (3) finally, the way the organization practices publics relations is related to the identities it appropriates and the values it respects."
2007-0022,A Culturally Competent Approach to Exploring Barriers in Organ Donation Consent Among Haitian Immigrants: Focus Group Findings and Implications,"tervening for Organ Donation, Safe Sexual Practices, and Childhood Obesity Reduction",,,,Paper,A Culturally Competent Approach to Exploring Barriers in Organ Donation Consent Among Haitian Immigrants: Focus Group Findings and Implications,"Intervening for Organ Donation, Safe Sexual Practices, and Childhood Obesity Reduction","It is well documented that African Americans consent to donation less often than whites, have fears and misconceptions about donation specific to their cultures, and wait longer to receive transplants when the need is identified. However, there is less detailed empirical data on the transplant needs and barriers for Haitians. This paper describes results of 3 focus groups designed to identify culturally grounded beliefs, attitudes, and barriers to organ donation. Results were used to design and implement the Bay Lavi (Give Life) campaign designed to raise awareness and increase organ donation consent among Haitian Immigrants."

Both of these strategies intervene on several dysfunctional habits U.S. participants enact in conversations about race and thus help enrich the capacity of interracial dialogue to heal deep wounds and increase awareness."
2007-0025,Additive Versus Interactive Perceived Control Effects on Smoking Cessation Intention: Testing the Control as Precondition Hypothesis,"Assessing Risk, Defining Fear, and Understanding Perceived Control: Implications for Health Communication",,,,Paper,Additive Versus Interactive Perceived Control Effects on Smoking Cessation Intention: Testing the Control as Precondition Hypothesis,"Assessing Risk, Defining Fear, and Understanding Perceived Control: Implications for Health Communication","Using data from 3,428 smokers the authors demonstrate that perceived control moderates attitudinal and normative effects on quit intention. These results lend support for the perceived control as a precondition hypothesis. This hypothesis follows the idea that in contrast to the theory of planned behaviors assumptions of additive attitude, normative and perceived control effects on intention, an interaction interpretation of the role of perceived control seems to make more sense: Even when smokers have a favorable attitude towards quitting, why would they intend to quit if at the same time they are sure that they will not be able to successfully do so? The results are discussed both from methodological and conceptual perspectives. First, the lack of statistical power for interaction tests in observational data is addressed. Second, this research begins to explore when perceived control is most likely to moderate attitudinal and normative effects on quit intention."
2007-0026,A Diamond of Ones Own: The Right-Hand Ring Advertising Campaign and Relationship-Status Incongruity,Feminine Contradictions and the Politics of Mediated Ambivalence,,,,Paper,A Diamond of Ones Own: The Right-Hand Ring Advertising Campaign and Relationship-Status Incongruity,Feminine Contradictions and the Politics of Mediated Ambivalence,"The Diamond Trading Companys (formally De Beers) Right Hand ring campaign features a model wearing a wedding band, beside the following copy: Your left hand says we. Your right hand says me. Your left hand rocks the cradle. Your right hand rules the world. Women of the world, raise your right hand. This ad, part of a larger campaign currently appearing in popular womens magazines, exemplifies how gender identity dichotomies pertaining to female relationship status are used as a marketing tool by advertisers. Recognizing that magazine content is typically divisive in its presentation of prized feminine characteristics (Crane, 1999), my paper seeks to elaborate this observation by exploring how one particular advertising campaign utilizes womens aspirations towards self-completion/self-actualization and the associated hurdle of negotiating antithetical identity constructions, in order to fuel consumptive practices."
2007-0027,A Different World?: Television Viewing Among White and Black Adolescents and its Implications for Adolescent Sexual Development,Fundamental Issues in Assessing Media Effects on Health-Related Outcomes,,,,Paper,A Different World?: Television Viewing Among White and Black Adolescents and its Implications for Adolescent Sexual Development,Fundamental Issues in Assessing Media Effects on Health-Related Outcomes,"Data have consistently shown that compared to White teenagers Black teenagers watch approximately two more hours of television per day. The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of this difference in television exposure. Although much audience research contends that Blacks and Whites are viewing very different television content, an analysis of data collected from a sample of Black (n=232) and White (n=225) adolescents this study shows that, while White teenagers watch mainly general interest programs, black teenagers are watching Black-targeted programs in addition to these general interest programs. The implications of these different viewing patterns for exposure to sexual content will be discussed. Analyses concerning cable access, television access in the bedroom, and channel viewing differences are also presented."

It was found that both females and males compared themselves with models in advertisements, although females engaged in the behavior more than males. Significant associations were also found between ad-inspired comparison behavior and the importance placed on physical attractiveness in social roles as well as the acceptance of artificial means of enhancing appearance. Public self-consciousness was the primary psychological construct found to be driving ad-inspired social comparison behavior."
2007-0029,Adolescents Exposure to Sexually Explicit Online Material and Sexual Uncertainty: Investigating Perceptions of Pornography as Underlying Mechanisms,Top 4 Papers in Mass Communication,,,,Paper,Adolescents Exposure to Sexually Explicit Online Material and Sexual Uncertainty: Investigating Perceptions of Pornography as Underlying Mechanisms,Top 4 Papers in Mass Communication,"Recent research has established a link between teenagers exposure to sexually explicit online material and their uncertainty about sexual beliefs and values. However, research has paid little attention to the processes that may underlie this association. We hypothesized that the relation between exposure to sexually explicit online material and sexual uncertainty would be mediated by how adolescents perceive the social reality depicted in such material. Drawing on a sample of 1,519 Dutch adolescents aged 13 to 18, we first established with a confirmatory factor analysis that adolescents perceive sexually explicit online material along three dimensions: unaffectionate sex, male dominance, and female objectification. We found that exposure to sexually explicit online material exerted, via perceived male dominance and perceived female objectification, an indirect positive effect on sexual uncertainty. However, exposure to sexually explicit online material retained a significant direct positive relation with sexual uncertainty, indicating that the perceived male dominance and perceived objectification partially mediated this relation. This pattern applied equally to male and female adolescents."
2007-0030,"Adolescents' Exposure to Sexually Explicit Online Material, Sexual Uncertainty, and Attitudes toward Uncommitted Sexual Exploration: Is There a Link?",Adolescents and the Media,,,,Paper,"Adolescents' Exposure to Sexually Explicit Online Material, Sexual Uncertainty, and Attitudes toward Uncommitted Sexual Exploration: Is There a Link?",Adolescents and the Media,"There is little research on whether adolescents exposure to sexually explicit online material is related to two important characteristics of their sexual self  sexual uncertainty and sexual exploration. Moreover, the role of gender in these potential associations has hardly been studied. Drawing on a sample of 2,305 Dutch adolescents aged 13  20, we found that more frequent exposure to sexually explicit online material was associated with greater sexual uncertainty and more positive attitudes toward uncommitted sexual exploration (i.e., sexual relations with casual partners/friends or with sexual partners in one-night stands). Testing different causal models for the influence of gender, we found two direct effects: In comparison with female adolescents, male adolescents were less sexually uncertain and held more positive attitudes toward uncommitted sexual exploration. However, indirect effects of gender also emerged. Male adolescents consumed sexually explicit online material more frequently than female adolescents, which, in turn, was associated with both greater sexual uncertainty and more positive attitudes toward uncommitted sexual exploration. Our findings call for more attention to adolescents exposure to sexually explicit material on the internet and identity-related issues."
2007-0031,Adolescents Identity Experiments on the Internet: Consequences for Social Competence and Self-Concept Unity,Adolescents and the Media,,,,Paper,Adolescents Identity Experiments on the Internet: Consequences for Social Competence and Self-Concept Unity,Adolescents and the Media,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of adolescents online identity experiments on their social competence and self-concept unity. An online survey was conducted among a representative sample of 1,231 Dutch adolescents between 10 and 17 years of age. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we investigated the validity of four opposing effects hypotheses in an integrative antecedents-and-effects model. Adolescents who more often experimented with their identity on the Internet more often communicated with people of different ages and cultural backgrounds. This communication, in turn, had a positive effect on adolescents social competence, but did not affect their self-concept unity. In particular, lonely adolescents used the Internet to experiment with their identity. The social competence of lonely adolescents benefited significantly from these identity experiments."
2007-0032,Adolescents Online Communication and their Well-Being: Testing the Stimulation Versus the Displacement Hypothesis,Top Papers in Instructional and Developmental Communication,,,,Paper,Adolescents Online Communication and their Well-Being: Testing the Stimulation Versus the Displacement Hypothesis,Top Papers in Instructional and Developmental Communication,"The aim of this study was to contrast the validity of 2 opposing explanatory hypotheses about the effect of online communication on adolescents well-being. The displacement hypothesis predicts that online communication reduces adolescents well-being because it displaces time spent with existing friends, thereby reducing the quality of these friendships. In contrast, the stimulation hypothesis states that online communication stimulates well-being via its positive effect on time spent with existing friends and the quality of these friendships. We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of 1,210 Dutch teenagers between 10 and 17 years of age. Using mediation analyses, we found support for the stimulation hypothesis, but not for the displacement hypothesis. We also found a moderating effect of type of online communication on adolescents well-being: Instant messaging, which was mostly used to communicate with existing friends, positively predicted well-being via the mediating variables (a) time spend with existing friends and (b) the quality of these friendships. Chat in a public chatroom, which was relatively often used to talk with strangers, had no effect on adolescents well-being via the mediating variables."
2007-0033,Adolescents Sexual Self-Concepts and Media Use Patterns: Implications for Sexual Health Communication,Top Three Papers in Health Communication,,,,Paper,Adolescents Sexual Self-Concepts and Media Use Patterns: Implications for Sexual Health Communication,Top Three Papers in Health Communication,"Audience segmentation of adolescents has the potential to improve the effectiveness of sexual health communication. In this study, the sexual self-concepts of 915 black and white male and female 9th and 10th graders was investigated as a segmentation strategy. The 4 audience segments differed in their sexual desire and agency, norms, interpersonal communication patterns, and sexual behaviors. Analyses suggested that possible messages and sources should differ according to sexual activity rates, connections to parents, school and church, and relationships with peers. Analyses of media use patterns revealed significant differences in the frequency of attending to music, magazines, television, and the Internet; program preferences; and identification with teens in the media. Suggestions for how the different characteristics of these adolescent audience segments could inform sexual health message construction and delivery are offered."
2007-0034,Adults with Different Cultural Backgrounds Reading an Educational Soap Opera,The Significance of Cultural Backgrounds in Reception of TV Programs,,,,Paper,Adults with Different Cultural Backgrounds Reading an Educational Soap Opera,The Significance of Cultural Backgrounds in Reception of TV Programs,"This presentation will discuss findings from a qualitative study in which 53 men and women in Germany of different cultural backgrounds watched an episode of a new educational soap opera directed at (immigrated) adults. The soap opera which features German, Turkish, Iraqi, Kenyan and Russian characters meeting in a German language evening class is designed to show everyday life (and its obstacles) among different immigrant groups, and to motivate immigrants on their journey to acquire German. In group discussions, the respondents explained how they liked the individual characters of the soap opera (issues of familiarity, recognition, para-social interaction) and what they think there is to learn from this program. Interviews with immigrated women who viewed the whole series provided deeper understanding of character interpretation. Issues of gender and cultural background of the viewers will be addressed that are important for the understanding of how the respondents read the characters of the soap opera."
2007-0035,A Feminist Criticism of the Khajuraho Temple,Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,,,,Work in Progress,A Feminist Criticism of the Khajuraho Temple,Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,"One of the most celebrated manifestations of Indian architecture is the Khajuraho temple located in central India, built around the tenth century after the birth of Christ. The sculptures on the temple façade have stunned the modern world with the graphic sexual images they manifest in an institution that has traditionally been an epitome and symbol of the divine, as opposed to the carnal pursuits of human beings, which such institutions often regard with contempt. Several scholars have studied these erotic sculptures, to trace the historical development of erotic motifs in India, the role of sex in a religion which sanctioned sexual depiction in temple art, and the socio-economic milieu in which sexual depiction was sustained and glorified (Desai, 1975). It is also essential to remember that this temple is part of a society that is well known for its emphasis on religious conservatism and traditionalism, where nudity has been considered socially and culturally unacceptable. Furthermore, it is not uncommon that whenever a discourse involves the topic of sex and sensuality, the issue of gender is usually embedded in it. The present study, thus, looks at issues related to gender and its construction, as can be deconstructed from the non-discursive text of the Khajuraho sculptures. A specific research question addressed in this paper is: How do religious institutions employ the body as a site for rhetorically constructing gender in a way that privileges hierarchy? The feminist method of rhetorical criticism will be used to address the question this study raises."

A national survey of 471 respondents revealed that fewer than 15% have claimed to set aside emergency supplies, or to have developed evacuation plans or communication plans. Households with higher incomes, with children, and respondents aged 30 to 44 were relatively more prepared than others. Survey respondents who did not have plans or supplies were then randomly assigned to receive one of three hypothetical news stories of an explosion at a nearby nuclear facility: a natural disaster (a brushfire started by lightening), human error by an employee, or a terrorist attack. The hypothetical emergency  a release of nuclear material from a nearby nuclear power plant  and all other details except the cause remained constant. The terrorist attack frame elicited significantly higher ratings of fear and anger, but lower ratings of intention to prepare for future emergencies. Intention to prepare for future disasters was highest among those who thought the cause of the disaster was human error. Ratings of fear were positively related to planning to prepare for future disasters as well as to compliance with protective actions. Ratings of anger were significantly related to compliance with protective actions, but not planning for future emergencies."
2007-0037,A Framing Analysis of Science and Technology Weblogs: How is Science Presented by Commentators?,"Quality, Credibility, and Morality in Journalistic Genres Online",,,,Paper,A Framing Analysis of Science and Technology Weblogs: How is Science Presented by Commentators?,"Quality, Credibility, and Morality in Journalistic Genres Online","As ever-increasing numbers of readers flock toward weblogs online, the presentation of the material on these sites can influence more and more readers. Although framing analyses have long examined traditional news channels, comment-based sites presenting not just news, but particular interpretations of the news, have particular challenges in an analysis of frames. Additionally, the interconnected nature of the internet changes the ways in which references to other sources can be made, furthering opening the options for potential frames. Although frames of conflict are repeatedly found in a comment-oriented media, such as weblog, there is also a rise in a new frame, one of reference in which the media merely redirects or rereports news found elsewhere. Although perhaps not a frame in the traditional sense, its dispassionate presentation of a source stands in stark contrast to other comment-based items found in weblogs. Analyzing content online must take into account the new power of collecting sources and easily moving the reader to them. Although the sites examined present content in a variety of frames found in traditional media, the rise of new framing devices is important in studying the presentation of science in an increasingly blogged world."
2007-0038,A Functional Analysis of German Chancellor Debates,Campaign Communication,,,,Paper,A Functional Analysis of German Chancellor Debates,Campaign Communication,"This study applied the functional theory of political campaign discourse to three televised debates in Germany during 2002 and 2005; results are then compared with content analyses of political leaders debates from America and Israel. Overall, acclaims were the most common function, followed by attacks and then defenses. Policy was addressed more often than character in these debates. The incumbent candidates acclaimed significantly more and attacked less than the challengers. The incumbents used past deeds significantly more often to acclaim  and less to attack  than the challengers. These patterns are consistent with analysis of American and Israeli political debates, suggesting that the situation facing candidates for political office may incline them to produce discourse with important similarities that transcend national borders."
2007-0039,Agenda-Setting and Behavior: Impacts on Adolescent Political Activism,New Developments in Agenda Setting Theory and Research - 35 Years Later,,,,Paper,Agenda-Setting and Behavior: Impacts on Adolescent Political Activism,New Developments in Agenda Setting Theory and Research - 35 Years Later,"Although traditionally concerned with the transfer of salience from the media to the public, recent research has called for increased scholarly attention to the consequences of agenda-setting. Adding to this growing body of research, the current project goes beyond attitudinal outcomes to also explore the implications of agenda-setting setting on political behavior. More specifically, this investigation considers the role of agenda-setting in forms of political participation outside of traditional voting, such as volunteering and attending political protests. The data for our analysis are drawn from a panel study examining the political socialization of older adolescents and their parents in three states from 2002 to 2004. The theoretical and practical implications of the study will be discussed in light of the results of the analysis."

The news corpus analyzed by QDA Miner and WordStat consisted of 449 randomly-sampled stories. By borrowing the concept of attribute agenda-setting, we were able to find a joint point between agenda-setting and framing theory and use it to interpret and explicate the computer-generated visual representations of the topic juxtapositions hidden in the transcripts. The results not only draw a unique statistical/visual picture of how the networks covered the campaigns, but also demonstrate that QDA Miner and WordStat software are appropriate and robust tools for finding hidden patterns in news transcripts, patterns that would be impossible to detect with traditional content analysis methods."

Media exposure can influence the (in)consistency of intra-attitudinal structures, but the more direct question concerning agenda-setting is the nature of the basic causal relationships among media salience, public salience, and intra-attitudinal ambivalence. The basic learning model assumes that ambivalence to be an outcome of the basic process of salience transfer from the media to the public. However, cognitive inconsistency has been linked to greater information processing, and greater information processing is more likely to produce heightened salience levels. Thus, there is the potential for ambivalence to serve as a mediator in the relationship between media salience and public salience. This study is a secondary analysis of American National Election Study and National Annenberg Election Study data that provides initial insights into the role of ambivalence in the agenda setting process."
2007-0042,Agenda-Setting Effects on Vote Choice: Evidence From the 2006 Mexican Election,Agenda Setting,,,,Paper,Agenda-Setting Effects on Vote Choice: Evidence From the 2006 Mexican Election,Agenda Setting,"Most research on media effects has been conducted within mature democracies, which differ in a number of ways from emerging democracies. To extend the applicability of political communication research, this study examined the influence of news coverage of political candidates on vote choice using data from the 2006 Mexican presidential election. A content analysis of the campaign coverage by two national television networks was related to public opinion polls and election results using agenda setting as a theoretical framework. The study found that both Televisa and TV Azteca gave significantly more coverage to the winning candidate, Felipe Calderón, than to his main rivals, Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Roberto Madrazo. Also, the tone of the news coverage was clearly favorable for Calderón and Madrazo and markedly unfavorable for López Obrador. Regression analyses were conducted to measure the effects of news content on vote choice and found that half of the variance in voters' preferences could be explained by television network coverage. Specifically, the more covered and favorably presented a candidate was, the higher the percentage of public support. Significant effects occurred cumulatively, over longer periods of time, and not immediately. The results support the conclusions of a study by Son and Weaver that examined the 2000 U.S. presidential election and extend agenda-setting effects to the behavioral sphere."

This current study analyzes the content of the most popular pornographic videos, with the objectives of updating its depictions of aggression, degradation and sexual practices and comparing its results to both previous content analysis studies and the survey reported in The Social Organization of Sexuality (1994). The authors argue for a sampling method that can collect videos that are representative of mainstream, popular pornography on a national level, and for a definition that can best capture the sexualized aggression portrayed in such pornography. The current study indicates an unequivocal rise of aggression in pornography in both verbal and physical forms, compared to previous studies. The majority of the perpetrators are males; females are almost always the victims and they most often show pleasure after being aggressed against. When compared with the survey results reported in The Social Organization of Sexuality, our content analysis reveals that pornography frequently portrays sexual practices that are rare in real life and are desired by neither men nor women."

Educators have not been last in line in using technological aides to create a more stimulating learning environment. Building on the ideas posited by John Dewey decades earlier about using the tools to further inquiry, we now find ourselves in a world where classrooms are no longer thought of as a physical space with set meeting times. The ideas of classes and classrooms now have expanded definitions that point to online learning as a means of gaining educational experience. Following Deweys precepts this paper looks at the question of technology in education from a communication perspective, and attempts to make the case for a more human-centered approach. Concepts of social presence, engagement and interactivity are identified as key variables and the relevance of these are theorized in order to answer the question what is the influence of social presence, teacher presence and interaction & engagement on student satisfaction in online courses? Of primary concern is the learners satisfaction rather than the learners academic performance, since a lot of other personal factors, including intelligence, affect performance. Learner satisfaction on the other hand is a more direct consequence of the mediating environment. The results of a study carried out to explore the effects of these variables on student satisfaction in an online course are encouraging."

2007-0048,Alienation and the Information Economy: Toward a Marxist Critique of Consumer Surveillance,"rveillance, Consent, and Dissent",,,,Paper,Alienation and the Information Economy: Toward a Marxist Critique of Consumer Surveillance,"Surveillance, Consent, and Dissent","Marx introduced the concept of alienation to describe the objectification of labor in the production of commodities, a conversion that he claimed estranged individuals from the work process, the objects of their labor, and other human beings. Marx posited this concept in response to the production-oriented economy of his milieu, but the subsequent shift to consumer- and information-oriented economies places this concept in a new light. In particular, the development of consumer surveillance and consumer data profiles calls into question the extent to which individuals produce an information commodity, either passively or actively, through the act of consumption itself. Such proprietary information commodities are regularly constructed (and sold) by credit bureaus and marketers to identify and classify individuals. The extent to which such data doubles exist beyond the control of individuals is demonstrated in the recent phenomenon of so-called identity theft. This conflation of personal identity and financial identity suggests a new and perhaps more insidious form of alienation, whereby the labor of consumption and self-making is recast as an alien and hostile information commodity with far-reaching social and personal economic consequences."

With eighteen news television networks providing 24/7 news coverage, today, Arab media transformed, not only defying the official narrative of their local governments reporting the world through Arab citizens lenses; Arab transnational satellite stations became a proactive tool in the undergoing democratization process of the Arab World. Arab news networks are becoming alternative to lame political parties where the common man can actively participate in live discussions and debate issues that concern his daily life, creating active public sphere that can put pressures on rigid Arab systems and can make reality from vicarious virtual politics. In that sense, Al Jazeera is believed to be one of key Arab political parties, with more than 50 million members across the Arab World. With its own political agenda, ideology and followers, Al Jazeera is considered to be the herald of Arab democratization process. Its formula is simple de legitimizing Arab political systems through a spate of political and financial scandal news. Scandal revelations, especially in transitional states, are important in the democratization process. Stories of scandal serve to undermine institutions in the publics mind and can often provoke the setting up of government and parliamentary committees leading to the regulation of particular activities, hence development occurs. This article surveys Al Jazeera politainment strategies and their impact in the delegitimization of current Arab systems and how a new political order is taking place in the Arab World."
2007-0050,Al Jazeera: Communicating 'Frames of Common Injustice',Communication and Sovereignty: Dislocations and Relocations,,,,Paper,Al Jazeera: Communicating 'Frames of Common Injustice',Communication and Sovereignty: Dislocations and Relocations,"Since its inception in 1996, al-Jazeera, the Arab news satellite channel, has been the object of heated debate among ordinary people, journalists, politicians and media scholars in both the West and the Arab world. This has resulted in a substantial number of scholarly papers and commentaries, some championing the channels progressive broadcasting as a beacon for a new, free and open Arab public sphere, others who, in the main, see the channel as a threat to their economic and ideological hegemonies have fiercely critiqued the channel for being partial, non-objective, anti-American and against Arab rulers. Outside this polarity, we can also find very useful scholarly work investigating the channels political economy and programme structures.

This paper attempts to make sense of Al-Jazeeras success with Arabs using a phenomenological approach as an alternative methodology and asks: What is it that is inherent to the structure of al-Jazeeras programming that makes it so popular, even a phenomenon with Arab audiences? This paper argues, through unpicking the structure of different al-Jazeera programmes that the channels success is inherent to its highly perceptive understanding and communication of the common frames of injustice shared by Arab and Muslim audiences. The communication of these frames, I argue, is not unintentional or hazardous; rather, it is part of a coherent intentional care-structure that is intentionally embedded in most of al-Jazeeras programming. It is these frames of common injustice and how they are communicated, this paper argues, that transform an otherwise stratified and heterogeneous audience into a homogenous one."

The episodes were culled from the original CSI series -that is, CSI of Las Vegas- and its spin-off series CSI: Miami and CSI: New York that have been televised in Korea for the past six years. In addition, the episodes were interwoven with creative interstitial materials produced and edited by the local cultural producers. One of the interstitial materials, for instance, offered a hybrid text wherein the audiences could compare the differences of main characters in each CSI series. Local fans greeted this media event with enthusiasmit recorded the highest cable rating on both occasions.
This media eventnamed CSI Day and CSI Day 2 respectivelymarks a significant moment in television history as its implication reaches well beyond the cultural and media landscapes of Korea. In recent years, Korea has been enjoying the success of its popular cultural products across Asia. A powerful cultural phenomenon termed Korean Wave usurps the East and Southeast Asia as audiences in such countries as Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia are crazy about Korean television drama, film and popular music. Interestingly, however, young Korean audiences have become big fans of hip U.S. television series in the midst of Korean Wave. By closely looking into the case of CSI Days, this paper attempts to address the meanings of the emerging media cultureand perhaps more importantly, the formation of new taste culturealong the global/local nexus."

There are now five national membership organizations with a primary focus on media literacy and these groups include scholars, K-12 educators, media professionals, and those with interests in youth media production, parent media education, and media advocacy. Using qualitative research, we report on information gathered from 50 long-form interviews designed to elicit practices and attitudes. Understanding the pre-existing perceptions of copyright and how these perceptions have influenced the development of programs, processes, and curricula can help with the design of educational outreach materials to build teachers knowledge and understanding. I intend to show how the concepts of ""content, critique and control"" may used to correct the variety of misunderstandings that educators have about this topic."

The Effects of Mood Management Processes on Subsequent Cognitive Performance",Causes and Consequences of Video Game Play,"This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of media stimulation on arousal and subsequent task performance. After inducing a state of low arousal, participants were assigned to experimental or control conditions via self-selection. Members of the experimental group played a computer game for five minutes, subjects in the control group spent the same amount of time awaiting further instructions. After these manipulations, participants who were exposed to the computer game showed significantly higher levels of arousal and performed significantly better on a subsequent cognitive task. The pattern of results was not influenced by the participants prior experience with the game. The findings indicate that mood-management processes associated with personal media use at the workplace go beyond the alteration of arousal and affect subsequent cognitive performance."

By the end of the decade, Winfrey had become not just a media tycoon, but a cultural icon. Time magazine named her among the 100 most influential Americans of the twentieth century. Popular press accounts proclaimed her a prophet, an inspirational phenomenon, almost a religion. Meanwhile, the synergy of her talk show, book club, web site, magazine and personal growth tours had made her one of the most trusted brand names in America. I argue that both developments Winfreys ascent to prophet status and Brand Oprahs stratospheric profitsare rooted in her embrace of mind cure cosmology under the tutelage of Marianne Williamson. The paper critically examines the incorporation of New Thoughts central premisethe creative power of mind to transform self and societyacross Winfreys media endeavors."

The goal of this research is to obtain insights into the reasons why people adopt or reject broadband in the residential context. This investigation is done from a user perspective. Using online questionnaires, a longitudinal (2001, 2003, 2005) study was performed. Results show that three features of broadband have been reasons to adopt it over the years: high speed, always on and flat rate. Furthermore, results show that for long the most important threshold was the financial one and paradoxically financial aspects are also a trigger for adoption. This financial bottleneck has largely disappeared, as well as the physical accessibility threshold. Cognitive and technical thresholds have shown less important over the years. What remains are the internet users who are quite satisfied with their current narrowband connection. It is probably hard to convince those people of the usefulness of broadband, unless for example alternatives are no longer available."

This paper complicates this assumption by placing in historical context the eruption of health and medical information in the mass media, and especially the Internet, in recent decades. Although the quantity of information we have today is truly on an unprecedented scale, an historical approach will show that health information as a commodity for mass consumption has a long history in American society. My research of mainstream magazines from the 1930s and 1940s show that, even during the golden age of medical paternalism when patients were expected to passively abide by their doctors treatment decisions, there was plenty of lay health information to be found in the form of doctors advice columns on self-care, nutrition, preventing disease, and so forth. Yet the availability of lay health and medical information in mass media did not cause a widespread patient revolt against doctors for their paternalistic control over therapeutic decisionmaking. My findings indicate that patients were not as passive about their healthcare needs as conventionally understood, but, under a physicians care, patients had no say in their own treatment choices. In this period of American medical history and in the culture at large, rights to personal autonomy in decisionmaking had yet to appear as normative expectations about the balance of power in the doctor-patient relationship."

However, much of the media discourse that hails or derides celebrities who spearhead awareness campaigns, assumptions are made about the power relationships that allow certain celebrities and causes to gain popular support while others are marginalized. In this paper, I use textual analysis to examine the popular media discourse that constructs Jolie as a reformed radical who now has a claim to legitimacy through her motherhood. While I acknowledge Jolies own attempts to structure her press coverage, I nevertheless argue that coverage of Jolie reinforces traditional gender norms, privileges institutional power, and disguises racial and class inequalities. Drawing on a Foucaultian theory of power, I examine Jolies role as a United Nations ambassador and celebrity activist."

The sites textual and visual discourse is replete with ambivalencethe girls recognize that they are dying in the pursuit of thinness, and articulate in excruciating detail their conflicted will to: consume, meet contemporary standards of beauty, glamour and thinness, control their voracious appetites and yet, to stay alive. Media backlashes cast these girls as deviantpossessing the (impossible) ability to spread Anorexia, and intending to entrap non-Anorexic girls in practices of starvation. This paper reframes Ana as an angry, distressed and confused girl trying to make sense of life in North American neoconsumerist culture-- that both glorifies and disdains overconsumption. The paper also applies a feminist lens to mainstream media and journalistic discourses that overdetermine power-starved, distressed girls as monstrous figures capable of social harm."

For a diverse array of reasons, contemporary youth have limited access to the types of publics with which most adults
grew up. As a substitute for these inaccessible publics, networked publics like MySpace are emerging to provide contemporary American youth with a necessary site for peer engagement. While networked publics provide space for various critical forms of sociality, the architecture of the sites that support networked publics is fundamentally different than the physical architecture that we take for granted in unmediated life. Persistence, searchability, replicability, and invisible audiences are all properties that today's youth must face in their public expressions.In this paper, I will discuss why youth are deeply invested in networked publics and how these networked publics alter their
participation in culture."

Drawing conclusions from this research currently is difficult because findings appear conflicted and many studies are underpowered. We present a meta-analysis of parental behaviors falling into three general clusters: positivity, aversiveness, and involvement. When comparing maltreating (physically abusive or neglectful) versus nonmaltreating parents, mean weighted effect sizes for these three clusters range from d = .50 to .65. Physically abusive parents are distinguished more so than neglectul partns from nonmaltreating parents in terms of aversive behavior, whereas the reverse is true for involvement. Finally, parent and child age, observation length, and task structure moderate the magnitude (though not direction) of differences. Our meta-analysis provides a clearer picture of the nature and extent of differences in the ways that physically abusive, neglectful, and nonmaltreating parents interact with their children."

Press Culpability and the Massacre at Wounded Knee,Ripped From the Headlines: Press Coverage of Race and Race-Related Issues,"Research examines mainstream newspaper coverage of the growing tensions between whites and the Lakota in South Dakota's Pine Ridge during the 28 days before the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre. Focusing on what the American press reported about the ""Ghost Dance' movement and the death of Sitting Bull, this research examines how newpapers abetted a ""moral panic"" among whites who encouraged U.S. military action against the Lakota, resulting in the events at Wounded Knee Creek."
2007-0063,"A Multilevel, Longitudinal Model of Entertainment and Affect in a Super Bowl Audience",ports and Media,,,,Paper,"A Multilevel, Longitudinal Model of Entertainment and Affect in a Super Bowl Audience",Sports and Media,"In this study, entertainment was modeled as a nested temporal process using ecological momentary assessments of a televised football game. Participants watched Super Bowl 2006 on television under natural viewing conditions and answered a brief questionnaire via the Internet at the beginning of each commercial break. Multilevel data analytic techniques were employed to analyze the longitudinal data from these assessments. First, entertainment from the Super Bowl was highly correlated to enjoyment. Second, even after controlling for individual differences, such as gender, fandom and team support, affect played a critical role. Third, average positive affect and situational positive affect had a significant impact on entertainment, although the effect of the situational component was greater than the effect of the average component. Also, situational negative affect had an effect on entertainment and seemed to work in concert with positive affect, which provides additional support to argument that both positive and negative components of affect contribute to entertainment."

In addition, I explored the multiple contextual factors and enabled and constrained the emerging patters and evolving norms developed in the process of team interaction. Structuration theory proivded the guiding framework for these case studies. Given our limited knowledge about how users combine multiple media in context of use, the study enhaced our understandings and practical knowledge of use of mutiple media in virtual team context."

Using face management theory, predictions were tested regarding whether answering or not answering a mobile phone and length of mobile phone conversations were related to perceptions of positive and negative face threats and negative feelings. In a laboratory setting, dating couples who were engaged in a conversational activity were interrupted by a mobile phone call. Results indicated that partners answering the phone experienced negative feelings and felt that they had imposed on their waiting partner. Partners who waited while the mobile phone call was responded to felt that the positive self-image of their partners who answered the phone were harmed. Findings generally support the utility of face management in illuminating some of the challenges faced by the presence of mobile phones in contemporary dating relationships."
2007-0066,Analysis of the Public Relations of the Orphan Train Movement and Implications for International Adoption,Public Relations Round Table Session,,,,Paper,Analysis of the Public Relations of the Orphan Train Movement and Implications for International Adoption,Public Relations Round Table Session,"From 1854 until 1929 more than 200,000 homeless children were transported from eastern U.S. cities to rural families. This movement was known as the orphan trains and was emulated in Germany, Norway, Sweden, and, most notably, Britain. To gain support for this process of moving children for more than 75 years, the agencies engaged in a public relations campaign involving meetings, speeches, flyers, and advertisements persuading leaders and the public of the good this process brought to homeless children and society. The philosophy and methodology of American literary critic, Kenneth Burke, provide the framework for analyzing the rhetoric surrounding the orphan train movement. Burkes concept of identification, terms for order and pentad show that the symbolic action of the orphan train movement was an effective example of public relations with a heart. Implications from this analysis can be drawn to todays international adoption movement."

Structurally, hyperlink networks major actors were mostly Democratic senators. The shared-issue network is based on 24 issues. Republican senators cover more issues and play more central role in the issue network. Analyzing the two networks with geographical proximity and party affiliation networks indicated that physical distance influenced all the other three networks. Party affiliation is related to the hyperlink network. Suggestions for future research are addressed."

Given advertisings track record of gender representation, this paper explores the extent to which intrusive commercial forms do not simply inculcate programming with increased commercialism, but also with problematic gender ideology linked with specific commercial brands and icons. Reviewing research both in gendered advertising and hyper-commercialism, this paper will examine examples of gender ideology in intrusive forms such as Coors sponsorship of ESPN SportsCenter highlights and the NBC reality show Sports Illustrated: Swimsuit Model Search."

To evaluate the current practice and identify future directions of research, this study empirically reviewed family communication literature over the period of 1990-2005. Both overall patterns and chronological trajectories of the sample characteristics reported in the articles of eleven communication-related journals were examined. The results suggest that family communication research has not only increased its sensitivity to ethnic diversity but also recently expanded its scope to encompass societal issues that were previously underinvestigated. On the other hand, theory-driven investigations of culture-family-communication linkage were rare in the reviewed literature, suggesting the potential for incorporating multicultural perspectives into the research on family communication. Suggestions to help realize intercultural research practice are also discussed."
2007-0071,A Neo-Con Parade: South Park and the Call to War,Laughing Through Your Tears: Humor and 9/11,,,,Paper,A Neo-Con Parade: South Park and the Call to War,Laughing Through Your Tears: Humor and 9/11,"This paper is intended as an aggressive critique of neoconservative ideology, specifically as it relates to the war on terror and its portrayal in the media. Primarily an examination of the relationship South Park has with post 9/11 politics (i.e. Ladder to Heaven, Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants), the main focus of the paper will be to demonstrate how political discourse as constructed by the Bush administration, as well as its mobilization in the media, can be decentered and denormalized through a humorous, disruptive approach to narrative. A partial rebuttal to Brian Andersons South Park Conservatives, it is also meant to demonstrate how dissonant popular culture can be aggressively conceived to operate in what are often considered to be conservative domains. It will also briefly discuss the movie Team America: World Police, one of the examples of conservative ideology Anderson celebrates in Parker and Stones work as an example of how a disruptive strategy can result in a text that is at once reactionary and progressive. Through a discussion of neoconservative and neoliberal rhetoric surrounding 9/11, drawing primarily on Judith Butler, Susan Willis, and Wendy Brown as well as Slajov Zizek and Stuart Hall, the paper concludes that dissonant visual culture assimilates both types of discourse in order to produce a critical, and perhaps anarchic, sensibility."
2007-0072,A New Approach for Quantitatively Measuring the Effect of Moving Images,Measuring Reactions to Visuals,,,,Paper,A New Approach for Quantitatively Measuring the Effect of Moving Images,Measuring Reactions to Visuals,"So far, only few studies in the area of media effects research have attempted to obtain a reliable, quantitative measure of the effect of press images with the aid of representative surveysand of those investigations that have been completed, most were limited to studying the effect of press photos and other static images. There are practical reasons for this limitation. Measuring reactions to moving pictures within the framework of representative surveys is extremely complicated and, accordingly, expensive. The methods available for such testsi.e. the home test and presenting film sequences in CAPI interviewsare thus seldom employed in practice. For this reason, investigations on the effect of moving images will generally continue to be limited to laboratory experiments in the foreseeable future. Although such laboratory experiments do clearly demonstrate the existence of such effects, they often cannot provide an adequate indication of the actual strength of the effects measured, thus revealing little about the relevance of such effects under day-to-day circumstances.

As part of a joint research project designed to measure the effect of various aspects pertaining to speaking out in public this paper develops an investigative concept aimed at quantitatively anchoring the findings of laboratory experiments on the effect of moving images. Basically, one part of the experiment is conducted within the framework of a representative survey. Specifically, this involves experimentally measuring the effect of a speech presented in writing. In the laboratory experiment, the survey experiment is repeated and, in addition, various experimental groups are exposed to other stimuli that cannot be readily incorporated in a representative survey. In this specific case, the stimuli used were film sequences of a person giving the same speech that had previously been tested in written form.

Using this approach, the experiment included in the representative survey is intended to anchor the findings of the laboratory experiment quantitatively. A comparison of the results obtained in the field with the findings obtained in the laboratory provides us with an indication of the presumable strength of the effects which, however, can only be ascertained in the laboratory and not via representative surveys. The proposed paper will present the methodological approach employed and the concrete findings of the investigation, which is currently still being completed. The findings will show whether this approach is, as we can currently assume, a suitable method for measuring the effect of moving images included in television reporting."
2007-0073,A New Generation of Global Corporate Codes of Ethics?,Creating Corporate Social Responsibility,,,,Paper,A New Generation of Global Corporate Codes of Ethics?,Creating Corporate Social Responsibility,"Globalization theory suggests that across nations and regions the percentage of large companies with formal Codes of Ethics is increasing. Moreover, as a result of globalization, the content of corporate Codes of Ethics is expected to converge, revealing explicit principles, values, norms, and standards which the international community has accepted as integral to the construction and enactment of ethical workplaces. However, there has been little empirical work exploring the degree to which corporate Codes of Ethics reflect the dynamics of globalization. In this study we conduct a content analysis of Codes of Ethics of 125 of the largest global companies appearing on the Fortune 500 and Global 500 lists. Results show that across countries and regions Codes of Ethics are becoming more commonplace. However, their primary focus remains on increased return to shareholders and obedience to laws (the first generation of corporate social responsibility) rather than second generation (concern for employees) or third generation (concerns for the environment and the common good). Only corporations headquartered in the European Union showed a large percentage of codes representing third generation thinking. The results of our study suggest that there is still a long way to go until our very largest and most powerful corporations meet the challenges of globalization and fulfill the promise of a globally integrated enterprise."
2007-0074,A New Interaction: Demographics and Emotion/Cognition,Future Directions in Television News Research,,,,Paper,A New Interaction: Demographics and Emotion/Cognition,Future Directions in Television News Research,"Information processing theories inherited from cognitive science  specifically schema theory and the limited capacity model  are at the heart of what media scholars have used to study how citizens learn from the news media. However, two specific dimensions of news information processing deserve more attention. More research at the intersection of demographic variables and emotion/cognition in news reception is needed. While women, young people, and those with lower education are not avid news consumers, there are some indications that specific dimensions of television news messages might improve emotional attraction. Women avoid negatively framed news while lower education people do better with television than print. Also, as Doris Graber suggests, there is a need to study the visual aspects of information processing of television news. Considering the primacy of visual processing as demonstrated by findings in neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science  media scholars should pursue with more commitment the role of the visual component in processing television news."

By integrating mass communication and interpersonal communication research, the author found the dispositions played a more important role in explaining involvement than demographics did. Interpersonal utility motive and pass-time motive were important predictors of involvement. An interesting finding is that interpersonal utility motive negatively predicted interaction involvement, and positively predicted cognitive media involvement. In addition, this study provided insight into the Internet motives typology proposed by Papacharissi and Rubin (2000)."
2007-0076,An Experimental Test of Processes Underlying Self-Disclosure in Computer-Mediated Communication,lf-Disclosure Online,,,,Paper,An Experimental Test of Processes Underlying Self-Disclosure in Computer-Mediated Communication,Self-Disclosure Online,"A consistent finding in computer-mediated communication (CMC) and Internet research is that, compared to face-to-face communication, CMC results in higher levels of self-disclosure. We identified four possible mediators that may carry the influence of CMC on self-disclosure: self-presentation, similarity, self-awareness, and direct questioning. The validity of these mediators was tested in an experiment in which 81 cross-sex dyads were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: a text-only CMC condition, a visual CMC condition, and a face-to-face condition. Self-disclosure was lower in the face-to-face condition than in the text-only CMC condition and the visual CMC condition. Between the two CMC conditions, no differences in self-disclosure were found. Of the four possible mediators, only direct questioning mediated the effect of CMC on self-disclosure. CMC dyads engaged in more direct questioning and therefore displayed higher levels of self-disclosure."

The objectives included testing theoretical expectations regarding the organization of neural circuits involved in the perception of emotion and their relationship to the empathic experience of emotion, as well as the hemispheric lateralization of individualistic and prosocial emotions. Results are consistent with proposals that emotional communication is a dominant function of the right hemisphere (RH), and that its anatomical-functional organization mirrors that associated with propositional communication in the left hemisphere (LH). Results also support specific predictions that prosocial emotions are associated with LH functions, and individualistic emotions with RH functions."

Based on a theory-driven empirical research project on animation, this panel presentation focuses on the aesthetic dimensions of identity work in young peoples interactive processes of narration, a dimension that is less understood than is the socio-cultural formation of identity through narration. Important questions will be addressed and exemplified in the presentation: what are the aesthetic resources that young people draw on and appropriate in their narrative production processes? How are these resources re-contextualised through the production processes and with what results? Answering such questions, we argue, not only serves to nuance our understanding of what may be termed everyday narratives, but equally serves to complement our understanding of identity work and self-representation."
2007-0079,An Integrative Model of Mobile Phone Appropriation,Mobile Communication Adoption,,,,Paper,An Integrative Model of Mobile Phone Appropriation,Mobile Communication Adoption,"The evolution of mobile communication devices and services has taken up a dynamic which makes any prognosis on in this field almost impossible. Whereas part of this dynamic may remain inscrutable, we believe that a much higher degree of explanation can be achieved by paying more attention to the process of appropriation. To seize this potential, we propose to combine existing research efforts in this domain. Therefore, an integrative model to analyse mobile phone appropriation will be presented.
The model is based on existing theoretical approaches belonging to the quantitative adop-tion-paradigm (namely diffusion theory, theory of planned behavior, uses-and-gratifications and social network theory) as well as the mostly qualitative research paradigm devoted to appropriation (innovation theory, cultural studies, frame analysis). The resulting model inte-grates elements from all of these approaches. It is optimized (and partially empirically tested) for the mobile telephone."
2007-0080,An Intergroup Perspective on Coordination Between Social Service Agencies: Linguistic Category Analysis of Collaboration Accounts,Approaches to Intergroup Bias,,,,Paper,An Intergroup Perspective on Coordination Between Social Service Agencies: Linguistic Category Analysis of Collaboration Accounts,Approaches to Intergroup Bias,"Conflicts, inadequate service, and wasteful duplication of services are some of the difficulties that result from poor coordination between social service agencies when delivering services to shared clients. Past organizational research suggests that these problems can at least be partially attributed to the different social identities of the collaborating agents, who come from organizations with divergent (and often times, conflicting) missions and cultures, creating intergroup biases and ingroup and outgroup effects. The current study examined linguistic biases in an intergroup context through analysis of interview data of social service agents from various types of agencies with respect to their past effective and ineffective interagency collaborations. Using the Semin and Fiedler (1988) linguistic category model along with pronoun usage, we tested the hypotheses that bias would be manifested in different patterns of references to self and ones own organization, to other agents and their organizations, and to joint references. No evidence was found for classic intergroup bias. To the contrary, the data suggested that respondents perceived themselves and other agencies as belonging to the same ingroup. Implications for intergroup bias reduction are discussed."
2007-0081,An International Perspective on Citizen Media: Using Social Network Analysis to Examine Hybridity in the Caribbean Blogosphere,Online News and Civic Journalism,,,,Paper,An International Perspective on Citizen Media: Using Social Network Analysis to Examine Hybridity in the Caribbean Blogosphere,Online News and Civic Journalism,"This paper assesses the contribution of the Caribbean blogosphere as an alternative media medium to such issues as hybridity and globalization. This study used a sample of 29 of the most popular English-speaking Caribbean blogs from such territories as Triinidad, Barbados, Bahamas, Jamaica, and Belize. Results highlight that this cheap media tool is used primarily by local bloggers to reassert a local sense of indentity as opposed to cross-border dialogue. Less evidence exists to suggest that the blog facilitates a regional sense of identity. Although bloggers are sharing in inter-island conversations, the pull of geographical affinity and language commonality results in the forging of homophilous blog connections. Finally, as it relates to topical focus, these popular bloggers are more prone to use the blog as a tool for personal chronicling, a situation that contrasts the U.S. blogosphere where popular bloggers are primarily political bloggers."

Traditional means of educating through print brochures have limited effectiveness and a low shelf life as new information is continually released for public consumption. A number of chronic health conditions are growing at staggering rates. Type II diabetes is an example of a chronic disease that could be fought with improved educational offerings. This project sought to test the effectiveness of a website (Diabetes and You) about Type II diabetes designed for non-diabetics with low health literacy.
Methods: Research participants were observed as they viewed the Diabetes and You website, tested for diabetes knowledge before and after viewing the website, checked for functional health literacy, and interviewed to discover their perceptions of the website.
Results: Results indicate that users were engaged and interested in the website and particularly preferred the interactive risk assessment page. Users demonstrated an increase in knowledge about diabetes and its risks after viewing the website.
Conclusions: Results indicate that users appreciate this style of intervention and can learn from it regardless of health literacy level. Further research into more effective ways of delivering health information online to this key target population is still necessary to minimize the impact of health literacy."
2007-0083,Anonymity and Self-Disclosure on Weblogs,lf-Disclosure Online,,,,Paper,Anonymity and Self-Disclosure on Weblogs,Self-Disclosure Online,"Blogging represents a highly socialized activity, extensively used for communication with friends and families. Yet, bloggers are typically cautious about engaging in self-disclosure because of concern that what they post may have negative consequences for them. This paper examines the relationship between anonymity (both visual and discursive) and self-disclosure on weblogs. Research results suggest that increased visual anonymity is not associated with greater self-disclosure. Findings about the role of discursive anonymity are mixed. Bloggers with an online target audience report a higher degree of anonymity than those whose target audience includes people that they know offline. Future studies need to explore the reasons why bloggers visually and discursively identify themselves in a particular manner."
2007-0084,Anonymity Effects and Implications in the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation: From Crowd to Computer-Mediated Communication,Empirical Approaches to Intergroup Issues/Anonymity,,,,Paper,Anonymity Effects and Implications in the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation: From Crowd to Computer-Mediated Communication,Empirical Approaches to Intergroup Issues/Anonymity,"Anonymity, an important feature of computer-mediated communication (CMC), is embedded in this new technology. With the penetration of the Internet in society, many daily activities involve online interactions using email, list serves, instant messaging, chat rooms, bulletin boards, and video games. Anonymity, exemplified in those online activities, affects both the task and social aspects of online communication including information exchange, decision making, and relationship development. Interest in the effects of anonymity on identity issues is growing fast with an increasing diversity of empirical studies. In particular, research on deindividuation and its application in the online environment using the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation (SIDE) (Reicher, Spears, & Postmes, 1995) is influential and has started to snowball. However, given the fact that the definition and operationalization of anonymity are not agreed-upon among researchers, it poses a problem for generalizing across the results. This review examines the effects of anonymity on human behavior. It outlines how the prior literature has attempted to address this issue and how the SIDE model has developed as an attempt to tackle this question. More importantly, it discusses a framework describing the multidimensions of anonymity in CMC (McLeod, 1997), and subsequently raised 5 propositions mostly inspired by this framework. Furthermore, using McLeods framework, this review evaluates SIDE studies with regard to their anonymity manipulations. This critique reveals possible future research directions for refining the SIDE model and better studying the effect of anonymity in CMC."

Government sold a 30% stake in the state-owned incumbent network operator, Telkom, to expand telephone service to under-serviced areas and populations. Ten years on, the reform has largely failed. Telkom, granted a 5-year period of exclusivity to expand the network, has used its monopoly power to thwart competition. It has raised prices so high as to be damaging to the economy. The Regulator has been sabotaged by the Government, in part due to the consequences of the haste to privatize, in part because the ANC leadership has been loath to trust democratic structures outside of its immediate control. The situation has opened up opportunities for rent-seeking under the ideological aegis of Black Economic Empowerment."
2007-0086,Another Look at Framing: A Strategic Approach to Developing a Framework of Framing,Framing in the Media: Research and Reflections,,,,Paper,Another Look at Framing: A Strategic Approach to Developing a Framework of Framing,Framing in the Media: Research and Reflections,"This paper proposes an alternative theoretical model for examining framing effects. More specifically, the author argues that contemporary framing effect studies that investigate how frames at the macro level impact frames at the micro level neglect the contextual factors embedded within the process. The contextual factors, according to the author, include individual characteristics, social groups, culture, and dialogue. These factors may play a certain role in influencing how individuals process information. In addition, the author contends that strategic variables such as resonance, bridging, and integration are crucial in connecting the contextual factors in framers framing devices, and therefore should be included in the framing-effect model. The author asserts that the inclusion of both the contextual and strategic variables would make the framing effect model more cohesive, thereby enhancing the contribution of framing within the broader communication discipline."

One such variable is worldviewa philosophy of life that enables a person to make sense of ones experiencebut the notion has largely been unexamined in media effects research. This article examines how a persons worldview might moderate the way a persuasive message is processed, sometimes in the opposite direction of that intended by communicators. Building on the construct of worldview, the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion, and terror management theory, this experiment examined the question in a between-participants, factorial 2 (expertise cue) X 2 (argument quality) X 2 (mortality salience) experiment (N = 149), with worldview functioning as a measured variable. Some participants in the experiment were reminded of their eventual death, while others were asked to think of watching television. Then, participants tendency toward a relativist or traditional worldview was assessed. Participants viewed mock ads that featured either strong or weak arguments and had either an expertise cue or no cue at all, after which they rated the ads in terms of their attitudes toward the ad (Aad), the attitudes toward the brand (Abrand), and behavioral intentions. Worldview had a main effect on global evaluations of the ads, such that participants who tended toward a relativist worldview had lower evaluation of the ads and lower behavioral intentions. Mortality salience was found to moderate participants worldview, presumably making their worldview more accessible in evaluating the ads. This experiment also found separate main effects for worldview and argument quality on attitude toward the ad and attitude toward the brand, respectively. In addition to the identification of worldview as an important construct in media effects research, the theoretical implications of the findings for the heuristic-systematic model and terror management theory are discussed."

Other panelists will concentrate on the use of new media technologies in the service of various iterations of the anti-war cause. I want to look at the opposition to the opposition, specifically to examine the visual persuasion strategy-that is, the use of imagery-via right-wing pro-war or anti-anti-war blogs. Drawing from content analyses, personal interviews, and focus groups, my presentation will

a) present an overall survey of the kinds of anti-anti-war pictures displayed on right-wing blogs during the length of the Iraq war. For example, I will detail the genres that range from ""freaky anti-war kooks"" to atrocity images attributed to Saddam Hussein

b) report, drawing from interviews and my own analysis, on the strategic and tactical intentions of the anti-anti-war warriors, speculating on motives ranging from outright support of the war in Iraq to a more fundamentally political opposition to any anti-war movement at any time, and

c) present possible reactions to and effects of the anti-anti-war imagery. How do people react to exemplars of the alleged iniquity and perversion of peace activists and the attendant visual display of their ""bizarre"" behavior?

The main population for analysis will be drawn from anti-anti-war blogs such as zombietime, The Autonomist, Confederate Yankee, little green footballs, and Jawareport. However, I will also cite self-critiques of anti-war imagery within the anti-war movement itself."

Specifically, it is an examination of the socializing messages exchanged between blue-collar parents and their children (n=66) during a period of heavy deindustrialization. The results demonstrate that family-based messages about work and career do not occur in straightforward, unambiguous messages. Instead, communication about these issues--and ultimately communication about social class mobility and reproduction--emerges and comes to be understood through relational dialectics."

Our respondents sketches and photos suggest that they comprehended the various intersecting plotlines and educational messages of Ashreat Al Amal, that is, a more empowered status for women, abandoning harmful practices such as female genital cutting, and seeking safe motherhood and childhood. Our respondents sketches also suggest various degrees of emotional and personal resonance with the key plotlines and characters. The female genital cutting scenes and their deadly consequences held the most personal meaning for both male and female respondents as it closely paralleled their lived realities. Many of our respondents freely and openly shared the debilitating consequences of large families, especially on the health of women and children.

The respondents believed that computer and Internet efficacy, web design efficacy, writing efficacy, communication efficacy and English proficiency are required for blogging. Diverse positive blogging outcome expectations and negative blogging outcome expectations were generated. Positive outcome expectations were categorized into self-related outcomes, social outcomes, learning outcomes and other outcomes. Negative outcome expectations included waste of time, blogging addiction, privacy concerns, safety concerns, relationship undermining and etc. This study also raised a new concepti-anxiety. i-anxiety was defined as online publish anxiety. The data showed that writing anxiety, social anxiety, computer anxiety, and Internet anxiety and time anxiety were main dimensions of i-anxiety. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings were further discussed."

While it is true that this search for self is nothing new, for todays coeds, computerized communication has been a way of life as it had never been for their predecessors. For these young men and women, members of the Net-generation, their identities and relationships have been influenced by the Internet. This social networking function is made possible through the college student mainstay is Facebook. The present study explores how peoplemostly college studentsuse Facebook. We ask questions about how users maintain their personal sites, what uses and gratifications they receive from Facebook, and how dependent they are on the site. The present study will also address what they value in their friendships as a way of understanding what motivates them to seek companionship from the Web."

It uses an audience-centered perspective in an attempt to infer from Indian cultural values the Indian publics expectations of MNC apologia. The paper reviews research on Indian culture and society and discusses those aspects considered particularly relevant to public relations, and their implications for MNC apologia. Ten propositions about corporate apologia in the Indian context are advanced. The propositions are illustrated with a case study of the long controversy over pesticide levels in soft drinks."

As Home and Garden Television (HGTV) was the first cable network to offer non-stop programming about the home, it has influenced both cable and traditional networks. This paper draws important conclusions about the genre from a visual narrative analysis of HGTV program content. A rhetorical analysis examined 9 episodes representing the most popular shows throughout ten years of HGTV production, from its 1994 launch through 2005. This analysis was guided by the theoretical lens of the narrative paradigm and visual semiotic and metaphor theory. It finds that the pictorial syntax of the shows can be interpreted to suggest a summary of visual conventions of this genre. The studys value lies in its extension of a traditionally linguistic theory to pictorial imagery, and in its usefulness in understanding genre from a pictorial narrative point of view."

Structural Equation Modeling is used to test the Theory of Planned Behavior and reveal its power to explain the cognitive mechanisms underlying voting behaviors of young adults between the ages of 18 and 24. Two waves of data collection in the weeks before and after the 2004 Presidential election (n=270) reveal the strength of the theorys perceived behavioral control component in explaining behavioral intentions to vote as well as the utility of the overall model to predict voting behaviors. In addition to important theoretical contributions, the results of this research hold rich applied value to inform message design in voting enhancement campaigns. Given the dismal numbers of young adults exercising their rights to vote, scholarly research must not neglect this pressing stream of research."

The authors used appraisal theories of emotion to predict positive associations between relational distancing and both intensity of hurt (H1) and perceived intentionality (H2). Perceived intentionality was also hypothesized to moderate the association between intensity of hurt and distancing (H3). A research question addressed the effects of respondents sex and relationship type (friendship vs. romance) on the hypothesized associations. Daily diaries were used to collect reports of hurtful episodes from participants (N = 131) over a 14-day period. Hierarchical linear modeling results were consistent with the hypotheses, and results were not contingent on respondents sex and relationship type. The authors discuss the implications of these results for both future research on hurtful messages and appraisal theories of emotion."

Although this focus is understandable, it has led to theories and models that center on reactions related to humor, mirth, or amusement. As a result, much of the theorizing in the psychology of entertainment has a difficult time accounting for the breadth of media offerings that appeal to many viewers (e.g., sad films, tragedies) or the diversity of audience responses (e.g., sadness, contemplativeness) that differ from how enjoyment is typically conceptualized. This presentation will argue for the importance of considering appreciation as a notable audience response associated with unique emotional reactions and with preferences for genres that current theorizing considers odd or paradoxical. Data illustrating conceptual and empirical distinctions between appreciation and enjoyment will be presented, and directions for future research in entertainment studies will be discussed."

Her qualitative study of various Holocaust museums revealed specific observations pertaining to each role. This paper extends Wollastons research by examining these roles through quantitative analysis, grounding the study in the relevant literature of organizational identity and image. The participants of this study were directors of Holocaust museums and similar institutions found in the United States. The survey focused on Holocaust museums as sites of mass tourism, memorials, preservers of history, narrators of history, and educators. Each predominant role contained 10 specific roles based on Wollastons observations. Descriptive statistics of preliminary results are reported, and the specific roles and predominant roles are ranked in order of importance. The essay concludes with a discussion of practical implications for such museums and their public relations efforts as well as directions for future research."

A qualitative analysis was conducted using data from couples who provided accounts of their relationship across the course of a year. Though factors that instigated breakups and renewals appear similar to those reported in the relational dissolution and relational development research, certain themes reflected how these relationships may be different from relationships that do not cycle between on and off. Specifically, partners in these relationships appear to use breakups as a means to redefine the relationship rather than terminate the relationship. Additionally, partners frequently reported that their relationships improved after the breakup but also experienced uncertainty about their relationships. The themes reported are discussed in terms of areas for future research."

It is hypothesized that when the visual and verbal features of a video ad are consistent, ad effectiveness will increase. In the first study, 24 undergraduate students viewed 10 anti-smoking public service announcements (PSAs) and rated visual verbal redundancy with a 12-item scale. Ads pre-selected by experts to be high in VVR were rated significantly higher than those pre-selected as low. The second study utilized a nationally representative sample of adult smokers who each viewed 5 PSAs and rated visual verbal redundancy with a 4-item scale. VVR showed discriminant validity from message sensation value and argument strength but some convergent validity with transportation. The final study consisted of 427 adult smokers who each viewed 4 PSAs and rated visual verbal redundancy with a 3-item scale. Ads high in VVR were evaluated as more effective than those low in VVR. The result of the three studies is a well-validated and reliable scale for rating visual and verbal redundancy in video advertisements."

Nevertheless, some arcades remain active social spaces, attracting diverse clientele and offering gaming experiences different from anything widely available for home play. This paper presents the results of several months of ethnographic research in a number of arcades in 2 Eastern cities. My observations suggest that arcades operate as visibly, though flexibly structured social environments. Players choose or avoid gaming activities with consideration of the context and atmosphere of the arcade, the conversation and interpersonal interaction allowed in different situations, and the content and control of games themselves. While games designed for home play allow for long periods of screen-focused immersion, the arcade environment encourages briefer play with more attention to happenings off-screen, provided by the games and other players."
2007-0104,Are Couch Potatoes Really Just Vegetables?,fluence of Traditional and New Media on Adolescents' Health Behavior,,,,Paper,Are Couch Potatoes Really Just Vegetables?,Influence of Traditional and New Media on Adolescents' Health Behavior,"A plethora of studies have shown a link in children between high media consumption and an unhealthy lifestyle. These studies have led to the couch potato image that children who are exposed to a lot of media such as TV, print, computers, video games, and music exercise less and are less physically fit. The 2005 study of American youth Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8-18 Year Olds challenges these findings. It shows heavy media users as spending more time exercising and doing other types of physical activity. This paper seeks to investigate this surprising finding by conducting further analyses on the Generation M data set. These analyses include attempting to replicate the counterintuitive findings, investigating gender differences, considering media multitasking, and excluding music. Despite these attempts, the counterintuitive result that children who are exposed to higher levels of media spend more time exercising remains. These unanticipated results warrant further investigation."

This study attempts to provide further information on the blogosphere by examining randomly selected political blog sites. The findings indicate that political blogs do not share the characteristics of random blogs examined in previous studies. This study found that an overwhelming percentage of political blogs are maintained by men, political blogs are much more frequently updated than random blogs, and political blog entries are often composed of factual information reported in traditional media and the blog authors opinion about the information."

Reflections on the Nexus Between National and Global Media Policy,Creating Communication Rights: Perspectives on the Emergence of a Global Social Movement,,,,Paper,Are States Still Important? Reflections on the Nexus Between National and Global Media Policy,Creating Communication Rights: Perspectives on the Emergence of a Global Social Movement,"National policy processes concerning media and communication issues have been for a long time, and for many aspects remain, the centre of action for political actors: public institutions, private entities or civil society organizations. In the field of media and communication, as in other areas of social struggle, collective mobilizations have often developed in national settings, to oppose, influence or promote changes in communication regulation. Such mobilizations can be thought to be resources and roots of collective actions that have recently focused and developed more and more on supra-national political spaces. State actors, in spite of being conceived as a single category, are not an homogenous reality as far as their capacity to intervene internationally and influence negotiations. Secondly, this differentiated set of actors has related and reacted in different ways to transformations in the global communication and media policy context in the recent past. By looking at the recent adoption of the UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity, this paper approaches the changing dynamic of state-actor in the global context of communication governance, assessing how state sovereign capacity of intervention is re-defined by the growing web of interaction among themselves and in relation to international organizations as well as by the interplay with non-state actors that express critical and alternative visions concerning communication content and processes."

Understanding Online Intercultural Communication Behaviors During Globally Distributed Collaboration,"""Interblogging,"" Web Design, and Online Intercultural Communication","In this research, we conducted an empirical study that explored the online intercultural communication behaviors of participants in the civil society decision making processes during the UN World Summit on Information Society using primarily asynchronous computer-mediated collaboration (CMC) tools. We analyzed the patterns of intercultural communication behaviors on the public civil society e-mail list based on a theory called high- and low-context developed by Edward Hall (1976). The contextual dimension emphasizes a powerful cultural difference between the low context communication styles that are the norm in most western societies and the high-context communication styles that frequently occur in non-Western societies. While Halls theory proffers a basis for understanding the cultural differences that exist between people in interpersonal interactions, this study is concerned with using the theory in another type of interaction: transnational virtual collaborative work. We analyzed archival email messages (N= 1760) of the WSIS Civil Society and the findings are presented in the form of qualitative descriptions as illustrated by verbatim examples of the messages."

Ethnographic research of Coca-Cola and Nokias marketing communications activities in Australia finds global corporations engaging with young people in local cultural discourse. In these marketing communications programs corporate websites and music festivals appear to be culturally authentic, strategic communication tools profiling young people into global market clusters. The organising discourse of these marketing communications programs is music culture content. Corporations establish a discursive zone, a web of meanings, within which any number of products can be positioned. Corporations engage young Australians in the construction of this web of meanings; young people undertake significant work in the production of these marketing communications texts, in the process institutionalising their culture as corporate brand content."

The proposed study takes a step toward understanding these processes by focusing on the following question: how do people of different cultural backgrounds manage their differences when working in multinational teams? The claim guiding this investigation is that communication is constitutive of argumentation and that the latter is a process that is collaboratively shaped by participants through interaction. Ethnographic analysis of naturally occurring events such as meetings and gatherings is used as the preferred method to study intercultural argumentation in organizational contexts."
2007-0110,A Self-Categorization Explanation for the Hostile Media Effect,Approaches to Intergroup Bias,,,,Paper,A Self-Categorization Explanation for the Hostile Media Effect,Approaches to Intergroup Bias,"The hostile media effect is the phenomenon where partisans on both sides of an issue believe that identical news coverage of events is biased against their side, and likely to influence moderates to favor the opposition position. There has been relatively little work directed at explaining the effect. In the current research we test a self-categorization explanation. According to this explanation, partisans see the media generally to present information contrary to their position because they categorize that information as representing outgroup views. In Study 1 (N = 134) the more politically partisan participants were, there more they believed that the media in general was biased against their party. This effect, however, varied in size across 3 conditions. The hostile media effect was replicated in a control condition, was amplified in a condition that rendered salient political partisanship, and attenuated in a condition that rendered salient American identity. The findings are consistent with the idea that political partisans can be responsive to social context, and that extremism is not a source of cognitive bias. A second study will be presented that aims to replicate this effect, and a third that manipulates the source of partisan criticism."

It has been intuitively believed that redundancy condition leads to greater attention and better memory in participants. Also previous studies have also suggested that redundant message results in better memory but with recognition and recall measures.

Being cared for by a trusted other raises the potential for mistreatment of the elder by that trusted other. The goal of this paper is to explore the possibility of preventing elder mistreatment by increasing the bridging and bonding social capital available to caretakers. Toward that goal, elder mistreatment and social capital are defined and discussed. Then, a model is forwarded that details how social capital might mitigate the effects of caretaker stress and decrease the probability that caretakers will engage in elder mistreatment in both home and long-term care institutional settings. Finally, implications for future research and practical intervention are discussed."
2007-0113,A Sociological Profile of Colombian Journalists,Portraits of Latin American Journalism,,,,Paper,A Sociological Profile of Colombian Journalists,Portraits of Latin American Journalism,"The Schools of Journalism and Communication in Latin America have grown dramatically in the past decades. Colombian schools are following that pattern. Despite of the fact that the countrys violence rate towards journalists is one of the highest in the world, actors from armed conflict and criminal violence are only some of the obstacles journalists have to face in their daily work. However, young people continue dreaming about working in the media and anchoring entertainment programs. This research describes the profile of Colombian journalists in four areas: the institutional, the formative, the personal and the obstacles/threats they have to face in the practice of their profession, using qualitative methodology: focus groups with professional reporters and news directors of 5 cities. The results of the research draw a scenario that could be useful for the young men and women who feel the passion to work at what Gabriel García Márquez, a Nobel Prize, has called the best profession in the world."

They are organizational crises. The strength in our knowledge of crisis communication is the depth of knowledge regarding individual crisis response strategies. The weakness of our knowledge of crisis communication is a failure to develop a theory-based set of connections between situational factors and crisis communication (Coombs & Holladay, 1996; 2004; Hearit & Courthright, 2003). This failure to understand the relationships between crisis situation and crisis communication makes difficult any endeavor to connect crisis communication with outcome specific to managing the organizations communication during a crisis. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to assemble a model for crisis communication that draws from our knowledge of crisis response messages, situational and organizational factors influencing crisis response, organizational culture, stakeholder communication, and interorganizational relationships."

And there is more to copyright than rules about ownership. Properly understood, this body of law puts a premium on promoting communication by creators, students, teachers and others. Various copyright doctrines, including fair use, secure the right to access and use copyrighted information in productive ways. But these venerable and vulnerable doctrines now are threatened. Copyright proprietors deny their existence or denigrate their importance, while their intended beneficiaries often fail to take advantage of them, through ignorance or fear. The most effective response to the expansionist agenda of content owners is for citizens to assert their use rights. The best practices approach, in which practice communities come together to develop a disciplinary consensus about what constitutes fair use, is an important example of how users can reclaim their central position in the copyright scheme."
2007-0116,Assessing Bias in Self-Reported News Exposure,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Assessing Bias in Self-Reported News Exposure,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,"The purpose of my study is to examine the accuracy of survey-based self-reports of news exposure. Previous research has shown that peoples self-reports can differ considerably from independent assessments of media use such as newspaper circulation (Price/Zaller 1993). These past research efforts do not go beyond anecdotal evidence, however. My goal is to assess the accuracy of self-reported TV news exposure more systematically. I use Nielsen data as a benchmark to which survey self-reports can be compared.
The Annenberg National Election Study (ANES), which was conducted as a rolling cross-section with independent random samples for each day of the year 2000, includes an appropriate question about respondents exposure to the nightly network news in the past week. This question was asked in all ANES interviews and can thus be used to calculate weekly survey-based estimates of the network news audience for the entire year. These survey estimates are compared to weekly Nielsen audience estimates. I also compare ANES and Nielsen estimates of debate audiences in 2000.
Results show severe over-reporting of news exposure. Survey estimates of network news exposure follow trends in Nielsen ratings relatively well, but exaggerate exposure by a factor of three. To make matters worse, the extent of this bias is not constant across time or individuals. For example, self-reported exposure to debates declines as time passes (but remains higher than Nielsen estimates suggest.) Faulty self-reports emerge not as a result of flawed survey design, but because people simply cannot recall or estimate their own news exposure."

As Martin-Barbero (1987), Garcia-Canclini (1989) and Leal (1985) have argued, studying popular culture  here the study of everyday use of tv and radio - cannot be done without considering processes of social change. Media ethnographies must relate to the breadth of conditions in which the specific culture exists. It implies deconstructing everyday life and identifying key factors influencing processes of sense-making and identity-formation. Informing my analysis of context in media ethnography I critically assess the multi-mediation model developed by Guillermo Orozco (1997). Mediations, defined by Martin-Barbero (1993) as the set of influences that structure, organize and reorganize the understanding of the reality that an audience lives in, are according to Orozco organized in a typology of 5 sets of mediations (institutional, individual, mass media mediations, etc). Drawing on recent fieldwork I conducted amongst South African youth audiences of HIV/AIDS campaigns I will assess applicability of Orozcos approach and reflect upon the methodological, theoretical and epistemological challenges of conceptualizing context in media ethnography."

Telecommunications and Global Knowledge Issues,,,,Paper,Assessing the Development Model of China Telecommunications,Competition or Regulation? Telecommunications and Global Knowledge Issues,"This paper analyzes the development model of China telecommunication which constitutes two basic considerations: economic efficiency and national sovereignty. These two considerations can explain a lot of anomalous policies and actions of the telecommunication authority in China. After examining Chinas success in telecommunications growth since its accession to the WTO in 2001, the author discusses the possible path China may take after reaping the benefits offered by the limited openness of the market in the past five years. The author points out that Chinas development model needs to introduce more competition in order to innovate and maintain its growth in telecommunication. A stage of invited competition is desirable as a transitional period from limited competition to full competition. A competitive independence development model will help China strengthen the local operators in face of global competition at home and abroad. A transition period of invited competition in which foreign-owned companies are invited to compete in the local market will be crucial to the success of telecommunications development in China."

Unfortunately, the theoretical debate between deliberative theory and the difference critique has reached an impasse. To advance this important literature, we derive formal propositions from each perspective and test these rival claims in the context of the jury system, the most prominent institutionalized deliberative practice in the United States. Surveys of over three thousand jurors who served in local courthouses indicate that gender and other demographic differences are poor predictors of jurors satisfaction with their service experience, including their perceptions of deliberation. The study also shows that emotiona dimension of deliberative experience presumed to be genderedappears important for both men and women. On balance, the results call into question the power of the difference critique, at least in the context of modern jury deliberation."

This analysis uses longitudinal survey data with information on content viewed at early ages to test the hypothesis that early television viewing is associated with subsequent attentional problems. The content types tested are: educational, nonviolent entertainment, and violent entertainment. Results of a fully-adjusted regression model show that viewing of educational television before age 3 is not associated with attentional problems 5 years later. Each hour/day of viewing of violent television before age 3 has an odds ratio of 2.07 for subsequent attentional problems (95% CI: 1.12-3.81). Viewing of nonviolent entertainment exhibits a statistical trend for subsequent problems (OR 1.63; CI: 0.93-2.85). Possible reasons for these results are discussed, along with implications for future research directions."

The FCC mandated number portability to wireless carriers for customer benefits through increased competition in the industry. Statistical analyses in this study reveal, however, subscribers perceive switching barrier is still high, discouraging subscribers from switching carriers. Carriers develop new subscriber lock-in strategies that make subscribers stay with current carriers. In addition, there are other hidden costs despite MNP that subscribers should burden with number portaling. In all, MNP is upheld by subscribers burden not carriers and not regulators, which partly explains the low number of switching subscribers under MNP. The findings imply that MNP has more directly affected the industries to a greater extent than subscribers, which suggests implications for both regulators and industries; how to effectively enforce MNP to achieve the intended goals and how to achieve competitive advantage with MNP."
2007-0123,A Theoretical Framework of Emotions and Media Entertainment,Emotions and Communicative Processing of Media Content,,,,Paper,A Theoretical Framework of Emotions and Media Entertainment,Emotions and Communicative Processing of Media Content,"In this presentation, I will outline what is necessary for an emotion to occur from the perspective of contemporary emotion psychology and how the mass media impinge upon our emotional system, especially from a media entertainment perspective. Emotions are not only seen as the very essence of interpersonal contact, modern technologies increasingly allow communicating emotions in sophisticated ways (e.g., through Television, the Internet, Mobile phones). This makes the role of studying emotions in mass and mediated communication even more salient. The complexity of the various aspects of emotion will be briefly discussed (e.g., basic emotions, the physiology of emotions, the importance of discerning between emotional expressions and emotional experiences). Furthermore, emotion and affect may take various forms in media entertainment research. Therefore, I will draw parallels between face-to-face communication of emotions and emotions in mediated communication (including affective computing). Finally, a theoretical framework will be discussed explicating under which conditions processing fictional media entertainment may extend to daily life communication and become incorporated in ones real world knowledge structures."

The key event was stopping a Norwegian freight ship, the Tampa, which had rescued several hundred asylum seekers from the possibility of drowning, from landing on the Australian mainland. The policy of mandatory detention for asylum seekers in remote locations, already in place, was further strengthened, and with increased efforts to force such people off-shore to countries such as Nauru. The following month the terrorist attacks of September 11 brought about enduring changes in Australian politics as in other democracies. For the first 101 years of its existence, the Federation of Australia managed to exist without any counter-terrorist legislation. In the four years since 2002, 24 different pieces of legislation have been enacted. The Governments victory in the 2001 election was resented by many of its opponents as relying on racist fears. In the years since, there have been several issues of contention regarding new incursions on civil liberties and human rights, but largely this has been an area where the Governments moves have been electorally successful. Media coverage has played a double-edged role, often amplifying criticisms of the Government, but at other times giving the Government considerable latitude in influencing and framing the news agenda."

The present study tests the interpersonal nature of parasocial interactions, as they are predicated under the assumption of being mediated seeming face-to-face relationships. In an attempt to examine responses to others who share similar levels of PSIs, an experiment (N=150) measures levels of evoked jealousy and envy as a function of ones perceived similarity of PSI between the self and another interactant. Findings are expected to elucidate the nature of PSIs as they are manifested in the context of interpersonal interactions and suggest implications for future research."
2007-0126,Attending to the Unattended: Disfluencies and Discourse Markers in Deceptive Conversation,"Articulating Support, Attending to Discourse, and Being Mindful of Communication and Turning Points",,,,Paper,Attending to the Unattended: Disfluencies and Discourse Markers in Deceptive Conversation,"Articulating Support, Attending to Discourse, and Being Mindful of Communication and Turning Points","In this paper we examine the role of disfluencies (uh, um) and discourse markers (e.g., You know, I mean) in deceptive conversations. Twenty-nine dyads, comprised of a randomly assigned sender and a receiver, engaged in four topics of conversation. Senders deceived the receiver on half the topics and told the truth on the other half. The results revealed that disfluencies did not increase during deceptive communication. You know, which functions to increase mutuality and engagement between interlocutors, was used more by senders than by receivers. In contrast, I mean, which forewarns or distances the speaker from upcoming propositions, was used more during deception than during truth-telling. The results support a functional view of discourse markers, and the pattern of results is consistent with the Interpersonal Deception Theory, which argues that liars in conversation engage in strategic behaviors to 1) manage their image as a credible communicator and 2) control their presentation of information. The role of motivation was also examined, but the motivation manipulation failed to impact the production of disfluencies or discourse markers."

Even the most energetic efforts to educate the public about health risks will fail if we do not invest in understanding the characteristics and motivators that audiences will bring to the table. The coauthors have spent several years building and testing a model that can help scientists and other communicators think in a more sophisticated way about audience factors, particularly judgments individuals make about their risk knowledge and their information seeking and processing behaviors. In this talk, we will reflect on ways to employ the Risk Information Seeking and Processing (RISP) Model in applied settings."

However, the relationship between news releases and media coverage is far from direct and linear. This paper uses centering resonance analysis (CRA) to examine organizational news releases and mainstream media coverage by and about Wal-Mart in the United States for the first nine months of 2006. The emergent patterns resemble those of attractor basins in complex systems, with adjacent realms that contain both distinct and separate topics as well as those that mutually influence one another. These findings support the notion of reputation as a complex system."

This paper attempted to approach intercultural interactions from an attributional perspective. It was proposed that attributional style affects peoples motivation and perceived competence in intercultural communication. A survey was conducted to 209 American undergraduates, measuring their attribution style, motivation to engage in intercultural communication, and perceived competence. The results showed that both hypotheses are supported. Implications and future research directions are also discussed."

The results indicate that mass media use, as well as beliefs about existing information regarding breast cancer risk, influence individuals causal attributions and seeking of information about breast cancer risk. Concerns about the local environment also positively relate to individuals association of breast cancer risk with environmental factors. The conclusions argue for bottom-up dialectical health communication strategies that take into account individuals understandings and perceptions of breast cancer risk and their local environment."
2007-0131,Audiences and the European Public Sphere: Examining Citizens Participation in the European Constitutional Debate,Audience Perspectives on the European Public Sphere,,,,Paper,Audiences and the European Public Sphere: Examining Citizens Participation in the European Constitutional Debate,Audience Perspectives on the European Public Sphere,"This paper aims to examine the audiences role in constituting the EPS from a both theoretical and empirical angle. Building on Deweys concept of a public sphere built on concern over issues, it starts from citizens perceptions of the impact of European politics, and analyses their participation in public discourses. Qualitative interviews were conducted during the ratification process in Germany, France and Italy to explore how, why and when citizens participated in the European Constitutional debate. Results indicate that citizens entered public discussion upon feeling affected by the failed referenda in France and the Netherlands. In their discussion of the possible consequences for European integration, argumentation patterns generally converged between the national arenas over time, attributing the rejection of the Constitution mostly to utilitarian considerations such as economic interests. The debate moreover shows that conflicts and crises foster citizens participation in public communications, and thereby the emergence of an EPS."
2007-0132,Austria: Diversity Through Delay?,Media Diversity in Small States: Limited Options for Media Regulation?,,,,Paper,Austria: Diversity Through Delay?,Media Diversity in Small States: Limited Options for Media Regulation?,"Austria is a typical example of the media system of a European small state under the strong influence of a bigger neighboring market. A more or less passive and corporate media regulation since the 1950ies fostered a high rate of press concentration on the one hand, causing cross ownership. On the other hand the broadcasting sector remained preserved as a public service monopoly for a long time. Finally, this situation led to an objection by the European Court of Human Rights committing Austria to open its national broadcasting market for commercial providers (radio 1993, TV 2001). This very late implementation of a dual broadcasting system enabled the Austrian broadcasting corporation to widen the scope of programs and content diversity over the years. At the same time a strong market penetration with cable and satellite (88 %) led to a liberalized market with many channels from abroad."
2007-0133,Authoring and Effects of Presence: How Authority is Achieved on the Terra Firma of Interactions,Discourse and Organizational Narratives,,,,Paper,Authoring and Effects of Presence: How Authority is Achieved on the Terra Firma of Interactions,Discourse and Organizational Narratives,"This essay draws attention to how authority is collectively achieved in interaction, providing support for the idea that authority is distributed among actors. In keeping with the theoretical foundations of what is today called the School of Montréal, we argue that authority, as a demonstrated capacity to influence the unfolding of a particular course of event, is achieved through effects of presence  that is, through practices by which past interactions and conversations end up being represented in an ongoing interaction. On the basis of a close analysis of a naturally occurring interaction within an organizational context, we develop three specific propositions in regard to the achievement of authority: 1) Authority is linked to an actors capacity to speak for others; 2) Achieving authority involves the inscription of nonhumans to make the organization and its structures present in the ongoing interaction; and 3) a shift of authority is possible when a punctual imbalance between actors is created in talk."

Through the use of hardware and proprietary software, these edited versions challenged existing paradigms of copyright. However, in film theory and cultural theory terms, sanitizing also challenges the cultural hegemony of the director-as-auteur, replacing him/her with a new figure of cultural authority in filmmaking, the technologically (as well as ideologically) empowered audience member. This paper surveys this cultural controversy, and conducts an analysis in visual narration to assess the impact on sample motion picture texts of this shift in cultural authority."

All the war-related news-items, from July 12th till August 15th, in the three major Hebrew-language dailies, and on the newscasts of the three major Hebrew-language television channels, are analyzed on the basis of the methodology developed in Dor (2004, 2005): The reporters texts, sent in by the reporters to the news-desks of the different media, are systematically compared to the editorial texts eventually produced by the editors  the news-pages (including headline formulation, positioning and visual semiotics) and the newscasts (including anchors texts, visual editing etc.). The systematic comparison reveals clear patterns of bias. These patterns are then explained in terms of what Dor (2005) terms the manufacture of identity: The reporters texts, which are about the news, are translated by the editors into texts which are eventually about the news-consumers."
2007-0136,Banking With a Personalized Touch: Impact of Website Customization Types on Users Commitment,Personalization of Websites,,,,Paper,Banking With a Personalized Touch: Impact of Website Customization Types on Users Commitment,Personalization of Websites,"It is widely accepted as a truth in the business industry that customization is an indispensable element for viable e-commerce websites. However, some critical questions have been overlooked: does website customization induce users commitment to the website more than does its absence? Do certain types of website customizations produce a good effect in enhancing relational bonds with the websites while others are detrimental? The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of types of customization on commitment toward the website. Building on the conceptual framework of levels of processing (Craik, F. and Lockhart, R., 1973), this paper identified remembering, comprehension and association as the types of customization. An experiment with pretest-post test control group (N = 100) was designed to assess the impact of these three types of customization on commitment.
The commitment variable is composed of affective attachment, perceived cost and desire to stay with the website. The results indicated that the presence of customization, in general, significantly induce positive affective attachment, perceived cost and a higher tendency to stay with the website than that without any customization. In respect to the types of customization, the comprehension and the association types significantly elicited positive affective attachment, perceived cost and desire to stay with the website. Remembering type was found insignificant on all dependent measures as compared with absence of customization. Implications of the findings are discussed."

Recognizing the limitations of prior research that uses either of qualitative or quantitative approaches, the model is developed using the concept mapping methodology: concept mapping is a multimethod, systematic, statistical approach to tapping the shared expertise of a group. Concept mapping provides reliable estimate with relatively small sample sizes making it ideal for the study of technology implementation. The methodology is conducted over a series of 6 steps, administered over 3 phases, which include brainstorming of barrier statements, sorting of issue statements and rating of issues statements. The results of the study provide insight into the complex, multidimensional nature of adoption barriers. The model provides an overview of the larger structure of barriers as well as the finer details of the constituent issues within each barrier."

Recent developments suggest that a new, powerful hybrid BBC is emerging in the United States. This paper examines a number of faces the BBC presents to the United States. 3 of these faces are more traditional, but the BBC has now added a fourth: as a super-alternative news/information source in the United States, carrying an aura of credibility that sets it apart from U.S. mainstream news media. It is the BBCs multifaceted nature, its reputation for honesty and integrity, and its independence from U.S. political forces, that allows it to be considered in this way. All in all, its an attractive package for many U.S. news consumers and, potentially, a powerful combination for influencing U.S. public opinion."

Through the globalization of American culture, International Societies are abundant in most countries. They develop due to a common acceptance of the English language as well as through a common acceptance of the American culture. Within this essay several points will be addressed to validate the existence of the International Society within each community. The points focused on will begin with an introduction of globalization and glocalization theories and explain how these theories exist in the modern world and their repercussions throughout various societies. Among these theories, ideas of Americanization and the global spread of consumerism will also be discussed. Finally, this essay will conclude with the significance and meaning behind todays International Society and the future forecast for where this society is headed."

The music video was released solely over the internet in early 2004. This paper will examine Dirty Kuffar as an amalgamation of myriad cultural flows and will analyze this music videos simultaneous position as a message of criticism and condemnation of the effects of globalization, as well its position as a hybrid cultural artifact that owes its existence and ability to resonate with audiences to the globalized world. The paper also discusses the implications of Islamic rap and its situatedness in the post-9/11 world."

The 2008 Games are a rare opportunity for China to present preferred readings of itself to the world and to its own citizens. Internationally, the event gives China an opportunity to challenge its status as Other, while simultaneously marketing its Otherness as a key selling feature of the Beijing Games. At home, the Olympics provide an ideal venue for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to blend state and popular nationalisms, claiming legitimacy as head of not only the state (or political structure built on socialist ideology) but more importantly the nation (as a unified people rooted in history, tradition and culture)."

In this paper in progress, I share some preliminary insights from approximately 300 qualitative in-depth interviews that I conducted with diasporic Hawaiians over the last eight years. I frame these interview accounts as diasporic stories of identity and belonging. The stories by these Hawaiians are rich tales of how and why they depart, leave, and break away from what they have known as home in Hawaii and then become mainland Hawaiians, and for those in the mainland Hawaiian generation, how they grow up away from aina (land) and develop an uniquely different kind of Hawaiianness"

Some of these challenges include motherhood, working in a male dominated field, retention, and earning tenure. Mason and Goulden (2004) found, for example, that women having a child within five years of earning their Ph.D. are 30% less likely than women without children to obtain a tenure-track position. Of women who had children early on in their careers, 56% earned tenure within 14 years of obtaining their Ph.D., whereas 77% of men who became fathers early on earned tenure. The purpose of our study is to lend additional voice to the experiences of female faculty through the use of focus groups and to offer suggestions on how womens experiences in academia might be improved and empowered."

We report the results of a survey of 120 office workers and 105 teleworkers that examined the degree to which social presence and work experiences impact their organizational identification. As expected, employees social presence and work experiences are more important to organizational identification than whether they work remotely or in a collocated setting. Additionally, perceptions of team cohesiveness fully mediated the relationship between social presence and identification. Regardless of whether they are teleworkers or office workers, mediation results also confirm that the extent to which employees perceive political behavior is prevalent in their organization, and the nature of their exchange relationship with their supervisor will have a significant effect on their identification."

Based on a qualitative analysis of 202 online columns, this paper examines how youth is constructed and performed on a Dutch internet magazine. I look at the role of the body in online identity performance and the regulatory schema behind the construction of youth. The study is informed by the idea that (speech) acts performatively produce identity instead of reflecting (e.g. Butler, 1990; 1993). This study shows that youth is mostly performed by writing about sex, drugs and alcohol in a provocative manner with the intent to shock. Youthful identities intersect with other identities, like gender and sexuality, yet border crossing and experiment are returning themes. Offline bodies are articulated in cyberspace as well, and youth cannot be done by everyone, as a young body is a prerequisite to perform youth. The subversive potential of youth enables and prescribes a stable, settled adulthood. This study claims that young people draw from conventional ideas of youth to perform youth, thus performatively producing and maintaining a discourse of youth as a deficit state of becoming."

The Francophone and Flemish communities, although grown apart over the years, show many resemblances: a variety of mainstream and niche channels; public and private actors performing at the national and regional levels. The media system is characterized by a fairly high degree of cross-ownership. Major differences can be found in the implementation of European legislation, and the degree of protection of cultural specificity. We ask ourselves what stances are being taken in the French- and Flemish-speaking communities (1) contextually in terms of cross-ownership regulation; (2) institutionally as to the mission of the public broadcaster (pur sang or broader); (3) and content-wise, with respect to home-grown, high identity value productions, against transnational productions from foreign players?"

The present study sought to (a) identify the types of messages that recently bereaved adults evaluate as more and less helpful, (b) assess whether the person centeredness of these messages explains perceptions of their helpfulness, and (c) determine whether evaluations of message helpfulness vary as a function of demographic, personality, and situational factors. Participants (105 bereaved young adults) completed an extended version of the Support Intended Statement Survey (SISS), which assessed the perceived helpfulness of 16 strategies intended to comfort the bereaved. These 16 strategies were coded for the degree of person centeredness they manifested. Level of strategy person centeredness was strongly correlated with perceived strategy helpfulness. Reported helpfulness of the strategies varied as a function of participant sex and the disruptiveness of the decedents death, but did not vary as a function of need for cognition or closeness to the decedent."
2007-0148,Beyond Belief(net): Interreligious Dialogue and Trauma Communication,Crossing Boundaries in Communication,,,,Paper,Beyond Belief(net): Interreligious Dialogue and Trauma Communication,Crossing Boundaries in Communication,"After September 11, 2001 people gathered to talk about the events. They talked about the violence and they talked about religion. Since that time, religious institutions and congregations have made a stronger effort to increase interfaith dialogue among their members and others in the community while another organization brought interfaith dialogue into the online medium on a global scale. Beliefnet began interfaith dialogue forums two months after 9/11, providing a space for people to ask questions, share issues, and bring religious misunderstandings and intolerance to the forefront of conversation after the traumatic events. This study employed a mixed methods approach to determine who the participants were and what interaction patterns were observed in the interfaith rooms. The results suggest that a myriad of individuals worldwide united to talk about faith, fear, and forgiveness after 9/11. The forum moderators tended to cultivate 1 of 3 interaction patterns in their forum (monologue, dialogue, or interaction) and a culture developed in each forum through moderator leadership and participant interaction. The interfaith experiments from Beliefnet expose benefits of the online medium to facilitate this type of dialogue and also elucidate the need for people to communicate after tragedy."

Little is known about cognitive and social mechanisms that may explain socioeconomic differences in response to health news. This paper proposed and tested a theory-based model to predict cancer information seeking (active efforts to obtain additional information outside of routine media use and conversation) following major celebrity cancer news events. The Lexis-Nexis database was used to identify major celebrity cancer news events that occurred between February and August, 2005. These data were merged to the 2005 Health Information National Trends Survey, a national survey of 5,585 adults, by date of interview. Logistic regression showed that major celebrity cancer news events were more likely to promote cancer information seeking among respondents with higher levels of education compared to those with less education. These differences were explained by the fact that higher educated individuals tend to have more prior health knowledge and greater community involvement than less educated individuals. Collectively, results provide one explanation for widening socioeconomic gaps in cancer preventive behavior. Analyses highlight mechanisms through which these gaps manifest and might be addressed."

This study extends our understanding of such a relationship by demonstrating the mediating roles of health-risk perceptions and health-related self-efficacy beliefs. Surveys were administered to 274 college students at a large Southeastern university, and the data subjected to path analyses. Results reveal that exposure to health-related television news was associated with a higher perception of health-related self-efficacy, and that perception was related to a higher degree of life satisfaction. These results suggest that health-related perceptions other than materialism-related beliefs help establish the association between television viewing and life satisfaction. Other implications are also discussed."

An otherwise obscure telecommunications policy debate spilled outside the rarefied airs of Congressional Committees and the Federal Communications Commissions eighth floor to rage across the Blogosphere, major newspapers, YouTube and episodes of The Daily Show. This contentious discussion centers on an issue known as network neutrality, defined broadly as the non-discriminatory interconnectedness among data communication networks that allows users to access the content, and run the services, applications, and devices of their choice. As Congress debates whether network neutrality protections should be written into current legislation, the battle lines have been drawn between large telecommunications companies who own the pipes, on one side, and Internet content companies and public interest groups, on the other. This paper contextualizes recent events in relation to historical telecommunications antecedents. In doing so, we critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the current network neutrality debate and offer a set of guidelines for a new understanding of network neutrality. The paper concludes with an exploration of the social and political ramifications of this broader conception of network neutrality. We suggest that this new network neutrality provides a proactive foundation for creating a more democratic Internet."

By outlining how Western discussions on Arab media generally and Al-Jazeera specifically often rely on Orientalized discursive constructions which other the media institutions and audience sensitivities. Such formulations also appropriate the term Arab street, a mythologized and oversimplified notion to suggest a comprehensive and comprehensible consensual Arab public opinion. Conversely, Al-Jazeeras pan-Arab appeal and commanding control on regional news discourses has contributed to an affirmation and ossification of such formulations. The paper suggests directions for the reconstitution of a nuanced understanding of the Arabic media milieu."

They have largely ignored the visual and aural aspects of content, which are tremendously important for making messages memorable and conveying meanings and arousing emotions across language and culture barriers. Therefore I plan to discuss the importance of focusing on visual and aural messages in the age of global communication, including issues of cultural differences in responding to pictures and sounds. In my remarks, I will also review the progress made in recent years in analyzing visual and aural content, the major obstacles facing this type of research and, the new instrumentation that has become available or is on the drawing board to make content analysis more accurate and less labor intensive."

To begin to address this issue from a communication standpoint, this study analyzes the medias representation of immigrant crime. It was found that dominant, elite ideologies frame communication about this population, causing biased reporting. To illustrate this, a critical analysis of news reporting of the murder trial of a Hmong refugee is conducted by comparing mainstream newspapers to Asian-American newspapers. Biased tendencies include the propagation of state interests, sensationalized reporting, covert racism, and a focus on the moral deficiency of individuals in lieu of discussion of the societal issues that may lead to crime. The consequence of this style of news reporting is the colonization of the minds of minorities and the reproduction of biases that influences future cross-cultural interactions. These consequences illustrate the importance of minority-led news sources."

Postal Policy in the Era of Competition",Policy in Practice: Evaluating the Implementation of Communication Legislation,,,,Paper,"""Binding the Nation Together""? Postal Policy in the Era of Competition",Policy in Practice: Evaluating the Implementation of Communication Legislation,"18th and 19th century US postal policy was instrumental in forging a national civic community through expansion of service and the support of content of a public character. Legal prohibitions against competition coupled with cross-subsidies supported the growth and maintenance of a postal infrastructure dedicated to these aims, providing what is often termed universal service. The continued viability of universal service is increasingly uncertain as new forms of technology challenge regulatory barriers and potentially destabilize the rate-base. The aim of this paper is to explicate the forces driving liberalization and assess how since the mid-1970s postal planners have attempted to continue to provide universal service in the face of market competition. The increasing centrality of temporary labor, advertising mail, and out-sourcing to the provision of postal service all are products of attempts by postal planners to maintain the status quo in the face of static policy instruments and shifting communication markets."

Mainly, these authors have focused on the ideological dimensions of televised entertainment programming, analyzing how television was incorporated into the domestic sphere (Spigel 1992, Taylor 1991), how televisions representations of families came to stand in for the more complex realities of family form in the US (Lipsitz 2001), or the role of melodrama in television programming (Leibman 1995). By concentrating on content and ideology, however, these authors inadvertently minimize the role played by repressive forces during the early years of television programming, particularly the blacklisting of progressive cultural workers and the chilling of any viewpoints likely to challenge the emergent, intensely conservative status quo.

This presentation argues that the blacklist played a decisive role in the production of representations of family that first appeared in the US on television screens in the 1950s. Rather than looking at these processes of production and remembrance ideologically, and in terms of some broadly based cultural consensus, the project understands the imposition of what was, in essence, a racist, sexist, and homophobic version of the family as the result of the blacklisting of progressive cultural workers in the 1950s. The presentation I am proposing for ICA will follow the careers of several blacklisted women in particular: Vera Caspary, Getrude Berg, Shirley Graham Dubois, Ruth Gordon, and Joan Scott. Using recently declassified FBI files (over 1,000 pages on Graham Dubois alone); the presentation will elaborate on why these particular women were singled out for surveillance and, ultimately, banishment from broadcasting. In effect, it will analyze why the FBI and the authors of Red Channels considered these women to pose a significant threat to US society. Mindful of Ellen Schreckers observation that it is possible that the main impact of the red scare may well be in what did not happen rather than in what did . . . the books that were never written and the movies that were never made (1995), the presentation also considers the kind of work these women produced before being blacklisted, as well as the work they struggled to do afterwards."

The Elaboration Likelihood Model by Petty and Cacioppo argues that engagement with messages that consist of substantive content cause the audience member to critically analyze the message, which can produce awareness and attitude change. An efficient way to add emphasis to the message and seize the attention of the target audience is to insert the message into an entertainment context. Our study attempted to analyze the impact of the peripheral cue character appeal (source perception with the main character in the ad) on audience members attitude change in response to analyzing high and low involvement message content. A 2 x 4 factorial design was used, with message involvement (high/low) and character appeal (White/Black and celebrity/noncelebrity) as independent variables. The findings showed that celebrity status is the salient factor, with source perception inducing attitude change as a main effect or in an interaction effect with high and low message content."

By their nature, directives may elicit 2 plausible yet opposite responses; some may obey the directive, while others may defy it by engaging in the (implicitly or explicitly) limited behavior. Prior studies explain these reactions, in part, to traits like psychological reactance. Using two studies, we investigate (1) the relationship between participants psychological reactance and their reactions to a health directive, and (2) the consistency of participants obedience or reactance to directives which implicitly, and then, explicitly limited actions. Our findings indicate that most participants intend to obey medical directives, and psychological reactance predicts differences in intentions to obey. In addition, participants who do not show psychological reactance (or its opposite, trait obedience) shift their intentions between scenarios. With care, public health officials may script messages that encourage people without trait reactance to obey quarantine directives."

Here I develop a comprehensive theoretical framework to understand video surveillance and investigate the impetus behind the development and deployment of this technology as well as its social, cultural implications. In this sense, I offer a media ecological examination by focusing on the social, cultural environment in which video surveillance takes root. The questions that I address concern how and why video surveillance technologies and practices are becoming incorporated into our institutional and cultural practices, their social and political implications; and how they shape and are shaped by the larger media universe. One of my key objectives is to understand the cultural fascination with video surveillance, its articulation as commonsensical, and its unproblematic acceptance by the public. To this end, I examine prominent representations of video surveillance in film, television, news broadcasts and press coverage, and tackle the social relations and cultural practices video surveillance is embedded in. In doing so, I identify the political and ideological implications of these representations, and their role in developing ways of understanding video surveillance in public consciousness. Central to my project is the interplay between the society of spectacle and society of surveillance, both of which rely exclusively on images; are preoccupied with visual communication (albeit for seemingly different purposes); and evidently intersect through the same technology. Through a discussion of the cultural fascination with surveillance as in the example of infinite replays of surveillance camera footage on TV and on the Internet, and the appropriation of emergent communication technologies such as camera phones for voyeuristic pleasures, I argue that the social, cultural practices of spectacle and surveillance inevitably shape each other."

Epidemiological research has demonstrated that people living in lower socioeconomic neighbourhood contexts are less likely to engage in recommended levels of physical activity. However, the reasons for differences in uptake across contexts remain relatively unknown and poorly conceptualised, with poorer groups remaining less likely to respond to interventions and communication campaigns in a sustainable way. This paper firstly outlines a gap between our understanding of this domain from epidemiology, and the nature of the knowledge required to construct contextually sensitive messages in health communication around this problem. Secondly, we apply social constructionist theory to the development of a theoretical and methodological framework for investigating the issue, and thirdly, the paper reports on findings from an online qualitative study which uses a blog to record digital stories from a lower socioeconomic group of resident living in a new urban village, Brisbane, Australia, about their daily patterns of physical activity. The findings are discussed with implications for media and content in future health communication efforts on this topic, and an analysis of the role of the blog as both a tool for data collection and a medium for health promotion is provided."

More specifically, it seeks to understand how newer technologies, such as web based blogs and websites connect to the more widely documented practices of consuming conventional media, such as film, music, and TV programs imported from home, in order to maintain some metaphorical familial relationship with a distant geography. In doing so, it seeks to understand how new technologies converge with, and diverge from, previously documented cultural practices and performances. And questions what these shifts tell us about changing attitudes toward both their new homes, and their understanding of technology, among second and third generation immigrants. Through a combination of textual analysis, and ethnography, I attempt to theorize and discuss how the uses of particular technologies, and their related practices, act as markers of belonging, assimilation and the west. In essence, I argue that the technology itself separates the new immigrant from the citizen."

In an online survey of 113 respondents, cancer patients were found to be more likely than their companions to host their own blogs. Four factors emerged as gratifications of blog use: Prevention and Care, Problem-Solving, Emotion Management, and Information Sharing. Cancer patients and companions found blogging activity to be most helpful for Emotion Management and Information Sharing. However, a statistically significant difference was found in perceived outcomes for Emotion Management and Problem-Solving, where cancer patients found blogs to be significantly more helpful in these areas than their companions. Regression analyses indicate that perceived credibility of blogs, posting comments on others blogs and hosting ones own blog significantly increased the explanatory power of the regression models for each gratification outcome."

Participants viewed one of three videos showing a crime scene from a popular drama on television. The study used a repeated measures design comparing data collected over two time periods. In the first condition, participants viewed a close up of the body of a battered victim of homicide. In the second condition, there was a preliminary examination of the body by the medical examiner. In the third condition, excerpted from the television show, the victims brain was removed from the skull during an autopsy. The study measured how viewing these images affected fear of organ donation, medical mistrust, and intent to become an organ donor. In addition, the study tested the Drench Hypothesis measuring effects of perceived realism, media involvement, and role identification on mistrust, fear, and intent to become an organ donor. The study provided some support for the Drench Hypothesis and showed that exposure to a gory autopsy had significant negative effects on intent to become an organ donor."

The Effect of Gossip on Levels of Cooperation in Social Dilemma Games,"Articulating Support, Attending to Discourse, and Being Mindful of Communication and Turning Points","Is it true that a little negative gossip about a mutually known third party can help cement an early-stage friendship? The idea that gossip is a social bonding system has been dominating the research on gossip for a couple decades. Researchers within various domains of the social sciences believe that gossip unites people, and illustrated this idea with ethnographic data, but so far few of them have given substantial proof to this claim. Using levels of cooperation in a social dilemma game as a proxy to measure social bonding between two people, this study shows that gossip might not be the social cement of our society. Using the prisoners dilemma game, and 2 professional actresses as confederates, we compared the strategies used by female students who simply met with the confederate, to respondents who met and communicated with the confederate who either shared a gossip story or a self-disclosed story. From the theory that gossip acts as a social bonding system, we predicted higher levels of cooperation from the respondents who engaged in the gossip conversation with the confederate, but our results show a significant drop down in the levels of cooperation for this condition, compared to the condition of no talk or self-disclosed talk, who are not different from each other."

Our analysis shows that when speakers use collective person reference formulations (e.g. 'we', they) they are designed to refer to a collectivity (e.g. a couple) and not to the persons who comprise the collectivity. However, recurrently, when the sequential environment makes it relevant for speakers to refer to the persons who comprise the collectivity (rather than to the collectivity per se), but refer to them together, then they include 'both' in the formulation. This can be seen in the following cases:
[Holt: M88:1:5]
Les: .hhhh _Oh::. No:w. Which part'v Kent d'you come from.
Rob: Sevenoa-:ks.
Les: .tlk .hhhh Oh:::: do you e=

cause uh just ( ) wonderful person yihknow really good

Ben: =Wh[ere is she from ]
Kar: [interesting person]
In case 1, Les and her husband each attended the same grammar school, but of course they did not do so as a couple, and in case 2 staying in touch entails the separate intentions and actions of each person and not of the collectivity. Moreover, our analysis shows that both is regularly used when some type of actual or potential falling out or disagreement between members of the collectivity is being formulated. Once this usage has been identified, then it can also be seen to operate in less obvious environments, as in the following case.
[HB05]
Den: ...And Im uhm at the moment certainly uhm my husband and I are both very very keen on a home (.) birth

Here, Denise is attempting to establish that both she and her husband, as individuals, are strongly in favor of a home birth. She uses both here to indicate her husbands independent stance on the matter. The use of both in forms of collective self-reference such as we both and my husband and I both allows a collective self-reference form to be used in a manner that both connects and then segregates the members of the collectivity for the matter at hand."

Intercultural Issues in News Coverage","There has been a paradigmatic debate over weak China versus strong China. We aim to analyze how Chinas most influential foreign-news paper, the Global Times, presents a national elite discourse on the global order. It is part of Communist esoteric communication, a process in which the press transmits policy directives to subelites in order to maintain a myth of unanimity and to provide ex post facto justification of policy steps. While globalization is a culprit of world inequity and U.S. hegemonism, China has been portrayed as a winner. If the United States is bound to lead (Nye, 1990), then China is bound to rise. China must grab the opportunities to become a great winner and to revive the glory of historical past. China would do the world a disservice if it did not rise. The United States has been seen as a stumbling block to Chinas rise. Even so, China should maintain cold peace with the United States, not to challenge its world leadership and regional presence. China should play a responsible great power role within the existing global order, by upholding uphold Confucian values to make a more enlightened and humane world possible. So far media discourses have been economistic and nationalistic. They are narrowly, reductively, and lopsidedly oriented toward geopolitical implications of the United States to Chinas rite of passage to great-power status. While essentializing Confucian ethos, the media did not explain why the Communist regime had tried to eradicate it."

This approach is known as the entertainment-education (EE) strategy. In the Netherlands several health organizations establish partnership arrangements with the television industry and pay a certain amount of capital to have the prosocial issue dealt with in popular television programmes. A greater insight into the collaboration aspects of the design and production process of these entertainment-education television programmes is crucial for the effective implementation of the EE strategy. An academic debate would involve questions like: How is the programme content selected and created? How do health communication and television professionals collaborate? And, what are the hindering and facilitating collaboration factors? In this paper Bourdieu's theory of Field of Practice is used in order to create a frame of reference for the empirical study into this collaboration process between the television and health communication field. Differences in field mechanisms played a significant role in the complexity of the collaboration. In many cases there was an unbalanced collaboration setting (asymmetry of power). This imbalance can only be resolved by jointly creating a new frame of reference. Criteria that normally apply for pure educational or pure entertainment television programs formats do not fit with the criteria for EE genres. Therefore EE television programs should become a new genre and as such be accepted and consecrated in both the television and the health communication fields."

The students present youth-oriented visions of urban Los Angeles that highlight such kid-friendly landmarks as soccer fields, a Best Buy store, and a local karate studio. They also draw attention to the role of digital media in their neighborhood by prominently displaying new media artifacts such as satellite dish antennas on apartment rooftops. These antennas have become commonplace even in lower economic areas of Los Angeles. The adoption of consumption-based new media often precludes the active use of new media to create original works. This paper draws from interviews with the students, their parents, and participant observations in the animation classroom. This discussion emphasizes the importance of giving youth the resources to create media that reflect their lived experiences.

This is because blacks watch more cable than whites, and subscribe to premium cable in high numbers. This has made them the ""darlings"" of the industry. Blackness is used as part of 'branding,' or creating an identity, for cable channels, and not just for black-oriented channels such as BET. This trend can be found in channels including Comedy Central, HBO and Showtime as well. This paper examines cable's economic structure and the varying ways that blackness is used to draw viewers and create an identity for cable channels."

The economic backdrop is only one reason that traditional publishing companies will face dramatic challenges in the future. Challenges by new market entrants, sector consolidation and changing reader habits are already resulting in fiercer competition in their core business. This dynamic environment makes it important for publishers to find ways to differentiate their value propositions from those of their peers in an innovative manner. Many of the benefits delivered by newspapers and magazines are intangible. To a large degree, the value that a reader assigns to a publication is a function of its credibility and authenticity. Both of these qualities can - according to social scienctists' findings - be a result of identity. Building on this concept, the hypothesis to be tested is there is a link between shared company identity and benefits to customers. This will be investigated theoretically through a model that operationalizes identity for management affairs. The paper places particular emphasis on the internal aspects of the identity concept (e.g. history, leadership, employees). A market overview and case studies of the German business press will exemplify the findings, the research results might also serve as guidance for publishing companies in other countries."

In addition to adding a layer of regional nuance to discussions regarding the development of global market-driven journalism, this paper is also an attempt to highlight the difficult working conditions facing many journalists in Turkey. Finally, as the nation begins a long process of negotiation with the goal of full membership of the European Union (EU), it is hoped that the problems facing Turkish journalists discussed in this paper will trigger further nationally-specific research into the role of media owners and governments in the direct and indirect suppression of free speech and freedom of the press."

Pleasure and Arousal Reactions Reveal an Implicit Advertising Schema,New Insights Into Advertising Techniques,"This paper aligns with the dimensional view of emotions (i.e., pleasure and arousal reactions) on one particular type of persuasive communication: commercial advertising. Previous advertising studies show a tight linear relation between pleasure and arousal reactions (Morris, 1995). In two studies we demonstrate the reliability and robustness of this linear relation for varied samples of commercial ads on both an aggregate (i.e., when pleasure and arousal scores are averaged per ad) and an individual level (i.e., when pleasure and arousal scores are correlated per individual). We illustrate that this linearity reflects an implicit motivational schema that biases both ad creation and evaluation. We demonstrate that an ads deviation from the pleasure-arousal line was positively related to objective extraordinary message features and to perceived extraordinariness. Consequently, deviating ads may hold one key to break through the clutter."

These experts assert societal conditions cause health problems and diseases not solely individual behavior. They fervently argue if journalists would frame health problems in terms of underlying causes and public policy solutions, the public would attribute responsibility for these problems to society resulting in increased public political participation and collective action. This type of coverage is known as the public health model of reporting. Using an experimental design, this study manipulates the context of newspaper stories about cancer and obesity. Applying thematic and episodic framing concepts and gain and loss framing concepts, this research reveals how differences in framing affect public opinion about cancer and obesity. The findings of this study strongly indicate combined news frames influence framing effects. This research shows combining thematic/episodic framing and gain/loss framing intensifies media effects on attribution of responsibility. This study provides key information for public health experts to use in their work with the news media and introduces a promising area of research in health communication and media effects."

New Perspectives on Motivations to Play Video Games,"The debate on effects of video games thus far seems to have overlooked specifics of players and of games. In talking about harmful effects of violence games, scholars have a different audience in mind, playing with different games, than those denying such effect or claiming positive affects. Therefore, we studied what distinguishes various player-types, what types of games they prefer to play, what motivations lie behind distinct player-types, and what attracts them in their favorite games. Preliminary results (N = 397) of our survey revealed that, as expected, boys (aged 12-17) at a lower education level play more standalone games, play more violent games, and display less social motivations for game-playing, than their higher educated counterparts, who played more lawn and mmorpgs for social motivations. Furthermore, lower-educated boys were most attracted by the violence in their favorite games, whereas higher-educated boys were most attracted to the games potential for immersion."

The proposed treaty seeks to protect broadcasters by granting them a set of exclusive rights to control distribution and use of broadcasts, mirroring current intellectual property rights. While there are a number of grounds on which to challenge the value of the Treaty, there has been little consideration of whether the Treaty will actually ""protect"" broadcasters by enhancing the value of their signals, and if so, whether that added value is overshadowed by a loss of social welfare. This paper applies a social economic approach to the various proposed rights, and finds that much of the potential value is likely to be offset in the long term by declines in the demand and use of their signals. Further, most ""rights"" will also come at the expense of other groups, resulting in an overall loss of social welfare."
2007-0183,Building a Better Risk Message: A Guide for Solo Female Travelers,tercultural & Development Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Building a Better Risk Message: A Guide for Solo Female Travelers,Intercultural & Development Interactive Paper Session,"Women are choosing to travel alone in increasing numbers, but often cite fear of the risks involved as limiting their experiences. Specifically, fear of anti-American and gender stereotypes contributes to this fear. Within the realm of risk communication, how can this growing population of female travelers become more culturally prepared for the possible risks inherent in travel abroad? An analysis of risk communication and intercultural communication theory lead me to believe that risk messages aimed at this demographic must combine risk communication with cultural information to create a sense of equilibrium between knowledge and efficacy. As travel guidebooks provide much of the risk literature that is available for potential travelers today, this paper critiques existing messages from a variety of travel guides across a continuum of destinations. A guide for improved risk messages with respect to this particular audience is then created. In particular, it is found that the proper manipulation of stereotypes, given a strong background of cultural knowledge, can help travelers to develop strategies for dealing with unexpected situations and behaviors."

E-mail action alerts from the Christian Coalition and the American Family Association were content analyzed for instances of Kenneth Burkes three forms of identification for the purpose of contributing to public relations research concerning rhetorical identification and its role in organization-public relationship building. Results showed that these organizations utilized Burkes identification through antithesis strategy with the greatest frequency, possible indicating that the Christian Right most often frames its identification efforts with confrontational overtones: identifying organizational enemies and their moral failings, and dictating a course of action to be taken against them."
2007-0185,"Building Community While Building ""Something Cool: New Immigrants and Youth in Canada",Neighbours versus Friends Who Live Nearby: Communication Technology in Urban Neighbourhoods,,,,Paper,"Building Community While Building ""Something Cool: New Immigrants and Youth in Canada",Neighbours versus Friends Who Live Nearby: Communication Technology in Urban Neighbourhoods,"My paper will review and discuss recent the findings of CRACIN researchers on the role played by community informatics initiatives in fostering civic participation, social capital and a sense of belonging in local communities in Canada. CRACIN (The Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking) is a SSHRC-funded research alliance based in the Faculty of Information Studies at the University of Toronto (Principal Investigator: Dr. Andrew Clement). CRACIN brings together academics, community practitioners and federal government officials to study the impact of community-based ICT initiatives in Canada.

Civic participation lies at the core of both the practice and intended outcomes of community networking, giving rise to hopes that community networks and other community informatics initiatives can help reverse downward trends in civic participation, social capital and the sense of belonging observed in many countries and communities in recent years. As a growing international and Canadian body of research suggests, community networks serve both as sites of civic participation, (where community members are actively engaged in the development, management, and maintenance of networks as community assets) and as enablers of civic participation, particularly among marginalized populations without access to new ICTs, by providing access, training, and content services and supports.

Recent CRACIN-supported research conducted at community networking sites across Canada has yielded some new insights in this regard, particularly with regard to the civic participation and community-building activities of new immigrants and youth, two groups that are typically less engaged and involved in their local communities than the average Canadian. The presentation will review and discuss a number of CRACIN-supported qualitative studies, as well as the early results of a quantitative survey of community network staff and users that explores how community network resources and services contribute to local community engagement."

Based on the Foucaultian notion that discourses can structure the way a thing is thought, and the way we act on the basis of that thinking (Rose, 2005), this analysis assumes that the magazine representation of pregnant celebrities works within a larger system of meaning, both drawing upon and informing the ways in which we conceptualize women, pregnancy and celebrity. The paper considers how representation of the pregnancies of actors Angelina Jolie and Katie Holmes functions in relation to issues of female stereotyping. Though analysis suggests that the stars tended to be represented in such a way as to construct a double bind for women in terms of their idealized roles as expectant mothers, the analysis is problematized by the issue of celebrity and its associated discourses."

This relatively new medium and industry have rapidly grown in popularity in recent years. The industry-regulated rating system designed to help parents make choices about video games has made the news of late because of the possibility of government intervention into its practices.
Parents who buy video games for their children participated in a focus group or an in-depth interview. Topics under investigation were the extent to which parents understood and trusted the rating system, how they used the system and how they felt about the possibility of government involvement in the video game industry."

This paper addresses this gap by examining the production and effects of what proved to be one of the most sinister books ever written the publication of which was in part responsible for the systematic imprisonment and extermination of thousands of women and hundreds of menthe Malleus Maleficarum (Buckland, 2002, p. 319). Whereas Witchcraft persecutions occurred before the publication of the Malleus, after 1486 a resource described in minute detail how and why to do them by the book. This study contributes to interdisciplinary research on media effects, the history of books as a mass medium, and the effect of Othering sexual and religious minorities. The first part of this essay briefly discusses the circumstances within which the printing and books appeared. The second part examines the infamous Malleus and how and why women were targets for the ensuing violence."

Jamaica provides a critical case study of the impact of post-colonial development policies on journalistic identity in the Caribbean region and throughout the developing world. The study seeks to answer the question: What are the contextual factors, forces and actors that most constrain reporters abilities to gather and disseminate information to Jamaicas public on the state of the environment (e.g. political ideology of media outlet, lack of access to information, dependence on foreign news sources)? Based on findings, locally-generated guidelines may be developed that suggest ways to better overcome the challenges faced in covering this aspect of Caribbean news."

These alternative partnering strategies are reflected in the dual nature of sexual content in women's lifestyle magazines. The present study explored whether such content may affect the characteristics women seek out in potential partners. In a laboratory experiment, women with different relationship goals and in different phases of their ovulatory cycle were randomly assigned to read an article from a womens lifestyle magazine that discussed sex in either relational or recreational terms before completing explicit and implicit measures of partner trait preferences. Condition, relationship goals, and fertility did not affect participants enjoyment of the article. However, after reading the recreational sex article, women scored higher on an explicit test of the importance of superficial, appearance-related traits in a potential romantic partner. Reading the recreational sex article was associated with stronger implicit preferences for partner traits associated with short-term relationships and low-investment reproductive strategies. Reading the relational sex article was associated with stronger implicit preferences for partner traits associated with long-term relationships and high-investment reproductive strategies."

Using framing analysis, the study employs a content analysis of 142 newspaper articles. Unlike previous studies, where content analysis found that the Iraq war has been positively portrayed, the findings of this study show that the newspapers interpreted the issue in negative terms. The results also show positive linkages between the orientation of the editorials regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and public perceptions of the issue."

What does this mean for the functioning of a well-developed referendum democracy? We answer this question on the basis of a long-term study on media coverage of referendum processes in Switzerland. We expect that even in the Swiss case professional campaigning supersedes the traditional amateur procedure and brings referenda campaigns more and more in line with candidate campaigns. On basis of the existing state of research this assumption is quite plausible. It is plausible seeing that for journalists it is much easier to fall back on contents provided by professional campaigners. However, it is not plausible prima facie for the Swiss case because of the fact that Swiss people are used to hold a vote on substantive policy issues and that they know the differences between candidate and issue voting very well."

Data come from a quadrennial survey completed in 1998 by the Chicago Council for Foreign Relations. The analysis evaluates the unique relationship between international news attention and evaluations of 12 countries, controlling for nonmedia factors. Findings indicate that media exposure could hardly tell people how to think about other nations, despite their supposedly need for orientation in comprehending the outside world."

By examining candidates agenda and media agenda of the 2004 presidential election in Taiwan, this study investigates the dynamics between candidate agenda and media agenda. Specifically, the directions of influences between candidates and media of the issue frames and strategy frames through the campaign will be explored. We hypothesize that there will be closer relationships for strategy frames than for issue frames between candidates and news media. Content analysis will be conducted to investigate the relationships between the candidate agenda and the media agenda, including news releases and news coverage in the newspapers."

Respondents report that 91% of the their professors had sent them e-mails. The most frequent e-mail communication was about academic tasks while social-relationship communication was less frequent. Professors, likely communication initiators, e-mailed students more frequently than the other way round. Professors and students exhibited a higher degree of reciprocity for social-relationship communication than for task e-mails. E-mail communication contributed positively to both professor-student relationship and teaching evaluation. Professor e-mail helpfulness, reply promptness, and e-mail frequency for social-relationship were the most significant predictors of both professor-student relationship and teaching evaluation. A discussion of implications is provided."

Using the 2000 DDB Lifestyle Study, we analyze a cross section of Americans (N=3,122) in terms of the associations among occupational categories, media usage, consumption practices, social behaviors, and indicators of civic and political engagement. In doing so, we find many parallels to the determinants of taste, cultural discrimination, and choice within the field structure observed by Bourdieu in 1970s French society, though there are also some notable differences. Most notable is the important role occupied by media consumption in defining the field of cultural consumption. The characteristics we map are arrayed along two axes of volume and form of economic and cultural capital. We find striking similarities in the upper ranges of the quadrants mapping a high volume of cultural and economic capital, but substantial differences toward middle and lower levels. Specifically, we find that in terms of the form of cultural capital, the distribution of positions is largely defined by patterns of taste that discriminate between refinement, moderation, nurturance, and a communal orientation, on the one side, and coarseness, excess, aggressiveness, and an individual orientation, on the other. Historical and national differences partly account for this variation, but we hypothesize that a major role is played by the formation of identities around media and consumption, leading to a more gendered and ideological positioning of taste cultures in the U.S."

In the Euro-American tradition, domestic photography was constructed as a celebration of the nuclear family with family photo albums reifying a vision of success and happiness. But it is a reciprocal relationship with images structuring family identity and family identity in turn influencing the production and interpretation of images. In Bourdieus terms, the family is both subject and object. This paper reexamines images of the family within the context of scrapbook photography. As a new form of exhibition for family photos, contemporary scrapbooks have altered not only the way family images are displayed but also how they are planned, shot, and edited. One implication is the emergence of everyday moments category of images with high symbolic value. These images are discussed in relation to family ideology and the commodification of leisure."

New developments in the area of spectrum policy provide increasingly frequent opportunities for policymakers to puzzle over pictures, charts, figures, maps, and diagrams. These policymakers are driven by enthusiasm for third-party band management, spectrum sharing, license-exempt applications, refarming, and attempts to contrast the efficiency of different methods of spectrum allocation. Choices need to be made about whether bands are ""full"" or ""empty"" (among other things), and regulators expect pictures to provide them with the answer. Indeed, regulators, licensees and users in the developed world are all commissioning, producing, and designing visualizations in increasing numbers.

It may seem that the efflorescence of decisions to be made about the spectrum is producing the surge of pictures. In fact, apace with the noisy revolution in wireless has been a quiet revolution in geographic methods. The increasing capabilities of wireless systems, desktop computers, and geographic information systems (GIS) have also combined to entirely transform the kind of pictures available to be puzzled over.

This study reports on an archival survey of spectrum visualizations used in policy proceedings in the US over the last 80 years. It then compares these pictures with very recent cartographic efforts."
2007-0202,Cartoon Coverage: Occidentalism and Orientalism Revisited,The Cartoon Controversy: Freedom of Speech as News,,,,Paper,Cartoon Coverage: Occidentalism and Orientalism Revisited,The Cartoon Controversy: Freedom of Speech as News,"This paper aims at studying the coverage of the cartoon controversy with the Orientalism
- and Occidentalism - critique as a backdrop. In 1978, Edward Said published his book
Orientalism' that dealt with the interplay between the ""Occident"" and the ""Orient."" In
reference to this view, the West has created a dichotomy, between the reality of the
East and the romantic notion of the ""Orient"". The Middle East and Asia are often viewed
with prejudice and simplification, as backward and unaware of their own history and
culture, and this view has been linked to political hegemony. ""Occidentalism"" may be seen
both as a simplification of the West (Carrier 1995) or as a response to the Orientalist
othering, which may entail a reversed othering of the West. Occidentalism may also be
seen as part of the counter-Enlightenment,a sort of response against industrialization,
rationalism, secularism, and individualism (Buruma & Margalit 2004). The study evaluates coverage of the cartoon controversy in the Egyptian and the Pakistani press  two countries in which the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad caused critique, anger and protests  and focuses particularly on representations of ""The West"" linked to the controversy. The main hypothesis here is the dilemma that has been empowered in current modern thinking between Occidentalism and Orientalism: are we looking at a clash of definitions? (Said 2000)."
2007-0203,Cascading Networks: Electronic Communication and the Diffusion of Social Instability,"rveillance, Consent, and Dissent",,,,Paper,Cascading Networks: Electronic Communication and the Diffusion of Social Instability,"Surveillance, Consent, and Dissent","This paper explores the role of electronic communications technology in social instability, specifically the impact of the diffusion of technologies like cell phones and the Internet on the cascade threshold for political revolutions (Granovetter, 1978; Kuran, 1989). While academic discourse in the mid-nineties tended to focus on the anti-authoritarian impact of new communication technologies, more recent works seem to concentrate on the opposite outcome, a world where ubiquitous surveillance cameras, radio frequency identification tags and powerful databases keep thought and actions so closely monitored that people become increasingly afraid to challenge authority. Without taking a normative stance, the paper argues that the emergence of electronic, networked communication technology shapes the possible dynamics of social systems in ways that have yet to be adequately explored, in part because of the difficulty in navigating between the Scylla of social shaping and the Charybdis of technological determinism. The theoretical issues which hold back empirical research are explored via a dialogic interface between three academic discourses: 1) medium theory; 2) diffusions of innovations and network theory, and 3) theories of revolution in political science. The issue of the diffusing item (Katz, 1999) is considered in detail, as is the effect of the interaction between network structures and threshold distributions on the likelihood of global cascades (Watts, 2002). An analytical model is then offered using three real-world events of political instability -- the 1979 Iranian revolution, People Power II in the Philippines, and the Tiananmen demonstrations in China -- as brief, illustrative examples."

At the same time, however, it has the second lowest voter turnout rate in the world. While scholars have offered various explanations for these patterns, researchers have yet to conduct a comprehensive project to examine how Americans have been encouraged to think about the vote, the voting process and their roles as voters as constructed in the media. This study attempts to fill this void by examining how the words vote, voter, and voting have been treated in print newspaper coverage of American presidential elections from 1948-2004. Specifically, over 26,223 instances of these terms were located in the Campaign Mapping Project text-base and were subjected to quantitative and qualitative coding techniques. Quantitative patterns show an overall increase in the number of these terms over time in news coverage. Qualitative patterns reveal how these terms appear in personalized and dramatized ways (such that voters are increasingly linked to candidates rather than issues or interests and greater tension is placed between a citizen and the integrity of the vote than between the citizen and the elected official the vote will soon hold accountable). This article details how such coverage may, in subtle yet powerful ways, invalidate voters, discredit the recommending force of the vote and depoliticize the act of voting."

The study examined 3 sectors of societythe political, civil societal, and economic sector, and communication technologies are classified based on interactivityinteractive vs. non-interactive technologies. Based on previous research, 2 ideal types of empirical causalitytechnological deterministic versus social deterministic approacheswere developed and tested using longitudinal time-lagged research design. This design helped to manipulate technology diffusion precedent to social change, or vice versa. The results of analysis showed: (1) Changes of economic sector and/or Internet diffusion in previous years are powerful predictor to technology diffusion or social change; but (2) results of model test support social deterministic viewsuccess of technology diffusion depends on social conditionsbecause it explains the longitudinal data better. With the implications of the results, theoretical and methodological limitations were also discussed."

With the increased number of channels that digital television provides, it can be difficult for a public service broadcaster to survive amongst media systems which are commercialized in many countries around the world. Based on the case study of the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), this study articulates the legitimacy of public service broadcasting in the new media age. The question of whether public broadcasting should be sustained and protected is at the heart of current media policy debates in Korea. With some examples of public broadcasting systems in European countries, this study examines the current status of Korean broadcasting policy for the KBS and suggests recommendations of new regulatory frames to accommodate the public broadcaster, KBS with the new digital broadcasting era."

A sample of 310 participants was randomly presented with a newspaper article about asylum. In the first condition the asylum seekers were implicitly labeled as innocent victims, and in the second as intruders. The third version was a mixed condition. The findings suggest that framing implies a combination of strong and weak media effects. First, frames are in aid of interpreting the news. The persons that were depicted on the very same accompanying press photo in the three conditions evoked feelings that were in line with the applied frame in the text. Second, the more outspoken the receivers attitudes, the more their own opinion challenged the power of the frame."

Democratic societies need a citizenry that can jointly deliberate about a wide array of issues. Traditional newspapers have shown to improve knowledge about politics and other societal issues and to widen the perceived public agenda. How about their online counterparts? Previous studies that compared online newspapers and Web-based content to print media, predominantly have shown that the print format is more successful when it comes to expanding the horizon of its readers. Traditional printed newspapers typically prestructure their information and essentially guide their readers through the content. It is argued that accidental exposure and consequently incidental learning may explain the success of printed newspapers. The multilayered arrangement of online newspapers on the other hand encourages - even forces - users to pursue their own path and select information that matches their personal interests. Greater media choice encourages selectivity and consequently may lead to more expert knowledge about preferred content only. So far, virtually all studies that compared learning effects of traditional and online newspapers have been experiments. With this study we explore the relation between exposure and awareness of civic topics in a nonexperimental, natural setting. A large survey representative for the Dutch adult population is used to examine how print and online newspapers affect the perceived public agenda in terms of its range and composition. We use multiple regressions and control for exposure to numerous other communication channels, and demographics."

The findings are based on a content analysis of the main evening news of the four major television channels, spanning five Bundestag elections and focusing on the portrayal of the chancellor candidates. During the observation period television has immensely expanded its coverage of the candidates. Simultaneously there was an increase in the visualization of candidate portrayal. German television news conveys an increasingly lively, colorful and exciting picture of the election campaign. The changes partially fit into the pattern of convergence (i.e., a mutual assimilation of public and commercial channels). As well as studying the change in style, our analysis also looks at some specifics of the 2005 election when for the first time a woman was contending for the office of chancellor. Our comparison of the television image of the candidates contradicts the presumption that a woman competing for chancellorship might come off worse in the news than her male adversary."

As a consequence, the activity is to a greater or lesser degree performed through interaction with a medium, and the symbolic content and the structure of the social and cultural activities are influenced by media environments which they gradually become more dependent upon. The theoretical framework is then considered in relation to linguistic change. Technologies of communication do not only mediate meaning and have a language of their own. Increasingly, mediatization has become an independent vehicle of linguistic change. Whereas dialects were responsible for linguistic variation in premodern societies, and sociolects for variation in industrialized societies, medialects are important for linguistic developments in a globalized network society."

First, health care communication norms developed based upon an acute care model and poorly serve providers who manage ongoing treatment for people with chronic illnesses. Second, professional hierarchies and boundaries persist in the face of a changing workforce and enormous reliance on paraprofessionals (e.g., technicians) to provide the majority of hands-on patient care. I explore power, knowledge, and communication surrounding these 2 trends by using an outpatient dialysis unit as a case study, suggesting that difficulties in providing and receiving dialysis care are influenced by resistance of patients and providers to adapting communication norms to keep pace with drastic changes in health care and instead reinforce traditional hierarchies. Drawing upon Foucaults work on power, knowledge, and surveillance as a critical lens, I explore dialysis care as an exemplar of how power circulates through unbounded, mundane communication."

Methods: Researchers conducted interviews with 19 community leaders and five focus groups with healthy men and survivors. The team also conducted process evaluations of 2 outreach projects in which survivors spoke to African American men about prostate cancer and screening. Results: Individual obstacles included limited knowledge about prostate cancer, prevention and treatment, and fear of cancer. Sociocultural factors included distrust of the medical system, lack of routine preventive care, reluctance to talk about cancer, and stigma about screening. Institutional deficits included the scarcity of educational efforts that target prostate cancer. The evaluations illustrate that survivors can contribute to promotion of prostate knowledge, positive screening attitudes, and conversations about prostate cancer. Survivor educators included little information about screening risks and decision-making however. Conclusions: Findings suggest ideas for message design emphasizing prostate cancer risk, screening risks and benefits, and decision-making. Outreach combining the credibility of survivors lived experience with the power of mass media and institution-based outreach efforts may shift social norms that inhibit conversation and foster fear over time, leading to more informed screening practice and better treatment outcomes."
2007-0215,Character Recognition as a Reliable Measure of Exposure to Alam Simsim Among Preschool Children in Egypt,Focusing on Exposure as a Central Construct in Health Campaigns Research: Interventions in Africa,,,,Paper,Character Recognition as a Reliable Measure of Exposure to Alam Simsim Among Preschool Children in Egypt,Focusing on Exposure as a Central Construct in Health Campaigns Research: Interventions in Africa,"Assessing exposure among 4 to 6 year-old children needs a simple but reliable and valid measure that can be used directly with the children themselves. Alternatively, exposure by children to an entertainment education program has to rely on the parents report of the childrens viewing. This alternative at most is a weak proxy for childrens viewing, since it lacks three main attributes of a robust exposure measure reception, perception and retention. For the evaluation of the national TV program Alam Simsim (the Egyptician version of Sesame Street) two measures of exposure were developed. A comprehensive scale measure including six self-reported items such as programs watched and favorite programs was computed and compared to a simpler measure based on the recognition of the main characters of the program. The reliability of the scale comprising the six measures was 0.79 (alpha). For the second measure, children were shown pictures of the three main characters and asked to point to each when their name was provided by the interviewer. Children were also asked which of the characters they would like to be their friend and the reason for liking them. Answers were compared to the character recognition to assess compatibility with perception of their shape and other characteristics. The reliability of this measure comprised of the recognition of each of the three characters was 0.87 (alpha). Both measures were used in ordinary least square regression to assess the effect of Alam Simsim on numeracy and literacy skills and on gender attitudes among children 4 to 6 years old in Egypt. The results, as measured by standardized beta coefficients, were very similar and statistically significant for each outcome. Character recognition is a solid and robust measure that can be used directly with children with no need to assess exposure from adults on childrens viewing."
2007-0216,Charting the Reality of Reality Construction  Or Why Carey Had It Right,Reality a Scarce or Abundant Resource?,,,,Paper,Charting the Reality of Reality Construction  Or Why Carey Had It Right,Is Reality a Scarce or Abundant Resource?,"There are many different realities, that is, many different domains which might provide the main orientation of our practice, both singly and together. But intersecting those domains are structures that constrain what, on various scales, we take as our primary reality. These structures are, in part, based on the concentration of narrative resources in particular places, a material process that Carey captured.
There are, however, two ways of applying Careys dictum more specifically to media. Do media narratives literally, and completely, construct the only reality that we can today live? Or is it only that the effect of media institutions symbolic power is to make it seem so? This paper will argue for the second interpretation, because it avoids mediacentrism, and better reflects the open-ended challenge (implicit in Levi-Strausss comment) to current media realities from other sources of symbolic power, notably religion."
2007-0217,Chasing the Bad News: An Analysis of 2005 Iraq and Afghanistan War Coverage on NBC and Fox News Channel,War & Peace,,,,Paper,Chasing the Bad News: An Analysis of 2005 Iraq and Afghanistan War Coverage on NBC and Fox News Channel,War & Peace,"This study analyzes all stories aired on NBC Nightly News and Fox News Channel's Special Report with Brit Hume during 2005 about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and compares that coverage with real world indicators to address several policy and theoretical questions: (1) Did the news media over-report the bad news from these conflicts, as claimed repeatedly by senior members of the Bush administration and as one might expect given prior research into the negativity bias of the press? (2) Do new institutionalist theories about news homogeneity explain coverage of these conflicts? (3) Does coverage of these wars fit an indexing and/or a cascade activation model of news? The study finds that while a fair amount of coverage on both channels focused on insurgent/terrorist attacks, a smaller proportion mentioned U.S. or civilian casualties, and overall the news actually underplayed the bad news from both countries. Comparisons are also drawn between the two channels, with data showing that FNC was much more sympathetic to the administration than NBC. In particular, although the administration, Republican members of Congress, and military officials dominated coverage, the tone of elite quotations was much more reflective of the deteriorating situation in both wars on NBC than it was on FNC."

For this purpose we will use the magazine Chilango as our object of study and we will identify in which way its section Alameda conceives chilangos and the activities they do in order to conform an identity. In the last three years, Chilango has compounded several aspects of Mexico Citys culture such as slang, images, places, social behavior, and even some political criticism. It has also given these cultural practices an irreverent and funny perspective. For this paper, three issues of the magazine have been selected, each corresponding to one of the three first quarters of these year. The research strategies that we will be using are: (1) a textual semiotic analysis of the magazine content and (2) the use of focus groups and interviews. This magazine reflects how its producers conceive life in Mexico City and gives tips on where to go and what to do to make the best of this city."

Country-specific samples differed according to sex and separately determined stratified socio-cultural sub-groupings. The children watched excerpts from different humorous programs considered typical for the 5 countries, provided moment-by-moment ratings of humor via an electronic Fun-O-Meter, and subsequently discussed why segments were funny etc. The data reveal that commonalities among childrens responses to the presented programs are far greater than the differences. Children in very different regions of the world found the programs funny at the same points; a finding supported by the analysis of the group discussions. When international differences in humor appreciation appeared, they stemmed from issues such as language, cultural proximity and media diet, all of which are aspects of familiarity."
2007-0220,"Childrens Materialism in Urban and Rural China: Media Exposure, Cognitive Development, and Demographics",Media and Health: Content and Consequences,,,,Paper,"Childrens Materialism in Urban and Rural China: Media Exposure, Cognitive Development, and Demographics",Media and Health: Content and Consequences,"In this study, an exploratory survey was conducted examining Chinese childrens endorsement of materialistic values and probing the influences of media exposure, cognitive development and demographics on the orientation to materialism among Chinese urban and rural children. Altogether 569 questionnaires were collected (254 from an urban area and 315 from a rural area) among children aged from 6-14 years. The results showed that children in mainland China generally held lukewarm attitudes toward materialistic values and urban children were more materialistic than rural children. Videogame engagement was the most significant predictor to materialism among media exposure. Childrens biased understanding of the persuasive intent of advertising contributed to their materialistic values, the viewing attention and liking propensity did not exert much influence though. Cognitive development was found to be negatively correlated with childrens endorsement of materialistic values, as older children were less materialistic than younger children. Also, consistent with the research literature in western societies, mainland Chinese boys were more materialistic than girls."

It develops a scientific model for social scientists to research distinct labor areas  replicable in different contexts  with the intention of helping the development of a reliable and valid methodology that can provide feedback on the educational process and that can be shared across disciplines. This particular study defines a new way of categorizing the journalism profession based on its professional competencies, and at the same time revealing the high percentage of jobs generated in areas apart from typical mass media jobs."
2007-0222,"Chiles Regional Journalists in the 21st Century: Attitudes, Behaviors, and Job Satisfaction of News Media Professionals in Southern Chile","Media Institutions, Workers, and Audiences in Latin America",,,,Paper,"Chiles Regional Journalists in the 21st Century: Attitudes, Behaviors, and Job Satisfaction of News Media Professionals in Southern Chile","Media Institutions, Workers, and Audiences in Latin America","This study provides a descriptive examination and statistical analysis of an often overlooked sector in Latin America  regional journalists. This 2006 survey, utilizing a transversal sample based on a census of all print and broadcast journalists in Chiles Eighth Region, shows that about 83.3 percent of respondents were under 40, most of them earned less than the equivalent of U.S. $400 to $1,000 a month, and nearly half of them rated their satisfaction with their jobs as only fair. Using statistical analysis, this study shows that the size of the company may play a role in job satisfaction, in line with studies of journalists elsewhere. About 50 percent of those who worked for small companies had very good perceptions of their job, compared with 5.6 percent at medium-sized companies and 6.1 percent at large companies."

Such presentations have important political, social, and economic impacts for the sponsor. In the case of its Olympic games in 2008, China seeks to address a unique exigence: To transform its image from a backward, repressive nation to a progressive pseudo-democracy. We will provide an ideological analysis of the image that China has constructed through its preparation for the 2008 games, focusing on the strategies used to address the exigence. Among the questions we will address in our analysis are: Is the presentation grounded in Western or Eastern perspectives? On what themes and images concerning China is the world asked to focus? Are charges of human rights violations or political repression acknowledged, contained, or muted? Is rural China included or excluded in the new image? Our analysis will provide insight both into the rhetorical processes of image transformation at the national level and into the communicative processes used in the Chinese culture."
2007-0224,Chinese and English Sales Discourse: A Comparative Study in Hong Kong,Creating Communicative Opportunity Within and Between Many Languages,,,,Paper,Chinese and English Sales Discourse: A Comparative Study in Hong Kong,Creating Communicative Opportunity Within and Between Many Languages,"This study aims to analyse and compare the discourse structure of Chinese sales letters and that of English sales letters based on an integrated analytical framework for cross-linguistic communication proposed by the author. The motivation for conducting this study is twofold. First, while there exists a multitude of studies that compare the syntax and grammar between Chinese and English, very little contrastive analysis has been carried out at the level of text, especially in the realm of persuasive communication. Second, understanding communication across cultures and languages is becoming increasingly important in sales promotion, due to the globalization of business. The corpus of this study consists of 160 Chinese and English sales letters, which were randomly selected from a database of over 10,000 sales letters collected from 36 categories of recipients in Hong Kong over a 6-month period. The letters chosen originated from 117 companies in Hong Kong, mainland China, and overseas countries. They represent a variety of author styles. The analysis shows overall similarities with respect to move structures in letters across the 2 languages. A number of differences are identified, and they include, for example, more frequent reference to social issues and less frequent use of pressure tactics in the Chinese letters. These differences can be attributed to the context of situation and to the reader-author relationship associated with the different corpora. Results of the analysis were verified by sixteen specialist and corporate informants in the field of sales promotion communication."
2007-0225,Choosing Among Abundant Realities,Reality a Scarce or Abundant Resource?,,,,Paper,Choosing Among Abundant Realities,Is Reality a Scarce or Abundant Resource?,"This paper will consider strategies of everyday life that people adopt to organize a reality for themselves when realities imposed by cultural elites or political hierarchies -- in liberal societies -- have declining authority. People change religions, jobs, and spouses more frequently than they did 50 years ago and reconstruct reality accordingly. People do not get 15 minutes of fame but 15 years of fame inside non-territorial micro-worlds (like media studies) or geography-based local communities. Parents tell children their behavior is ""inappropriate"" rather than wrong, situationally mistaken rather than forbidden. Some evidence indicates that liberals and conservatives not only vote differently and drive different cars but increasingly live in different neighborhoods. This raises tantalizing questions about what common reality remains and what occasions force our multiple realities into (productive or dangerous) conflict."
2007-0226,"Circulating The Look, (De)Facing Nationalisms: Young Chinese Women Consuming Korean Wave",Viewing/Forming Asia Through Visual Media: From Visual/Cultural Perspective,,,,Paper,"Circulating The Look, (De)Facing Nationalisms: Young Chinese Women Consuming Korean Wave",Viewing/Forming Asia Through Visual Media: From Visual/Cultural Perspective,"The success of Korean wave across Asia alone creates very interesting discussion of the dynamic interplay of the cultural, economic and political forces in the regional locality. In East Asia, where the impact of Korean wave is mostly felt, the heat of the discussion is focused on how notions of cultural proximity and cultural nationalism mingle with creative economies, government ideologies and foreign policies. Among the many epicenters, I think China provides an excellent position for investigating the tensions as well as dynamisms evoked by the Korean wave: how the intensified transnationalization of media is played out in two cultures (i.e. China and Korea) that are so similar in their political, economic and cultural pasts and futures in the age of globalization. How competing nationalisms also mingle with the spirit of cultural understanding and economic cooperation in these two economically co-eval, culturally proximate governments, as they grapple with the rapid ascension into the world stage with their economic success.
In this paper, I would further complicate the discussion by offering Chinese womens consumption of Korean cosmetics and dramas as a site to test how ideologues of femininity and beauty get caught up with issues of consumerism and nationalism, at a time when both countries are raging high on its economic development and competing for a favoured place in the sun in the international stage. The entry of Korean cosmetics and notions of beauty in China happen at a time when consumer revolution is the dominant revolutionist ideology in China. Young urban women find themselves clad with the national task to consume as a way to further boost Chinas raging economy. A new look is needed in the search of a new urban womanhood to match the image of the rapidly transforming nation.
Using interviews and ethnographies of patrons in cosmetic surgery hospitals and female Chinese audiences of Korean TV dramas, I will hope to gain an insight into the following questions: How does the Korean wave play a role in transforming notions of beauty and femininity among young women in China? How are cultural proximity and cultural nationalism (inter)played at the reception end in constructing this new look of womanhood, at a time when young women are grappling with shifting gender relations (as a result of the one-child policy), and consumerism becoming the new ideology in modern China?"

One of the key links in this infrastructure was first reported in Communication Yearbook 18. Since then, steady progress has been made to better understand how Citizens Advisory Councils (CACs) operate as a systems and dialogic meeting place for petrochemical company representatives to meet with cognitively involved community members. Company members are obliged by the bylaws of the CAC to report emissions, accidents, and other events that could or did harm workers or residents. Questions are raised by the citizens and addressed by company representatives. This presentation will explain this process, reveal qualitative and quantitative data about their effectiveness, and indicate the steps being taken to increase the communicative quality of these links in the risk communication infrastructure."
2007-0228,Citizens' Argument Repertoire and Media Discourse,Citizen Participation and Discussion,,,,Paper,Citizens' Argument Repertoire and Media Discourse,Citizen Participation and Discussion,"This research explores how news media may help promote citizens' argument repertoire. Building upon scholarship in information processing, schema theory, and political psychology, the author introduces the reflective cue. The study examines the extent to which this cue, when integrated in news media, may be successful at enhancing citizens awareness and processing of reasons. The design is a controlled presentation of issue information. Findings support the study's predictions that the inclusion of a reflective cue in media coverage would have a positive effect on cognitive orientations and on information-processing behavior. However, these effects did not lead subjects exposed to the reflective cue to express more issue-position reasons. Findings also support the studys predictions that exposure to news media content would enhance the extent to which citizens express reasons."

Bonding and bridging social capital are also used in the analysis to see if they have mediating effects between ethnic media use and the civic participation and political socialization outcomes. The results indicate that ethnic media use has no significant effects on civic participation or political socialization. Bonding and bridging social capital show positive associations with civic participation, whereas political knowledge is only significantly predicted by length of stay in the country."

Presenting research findings about the events of September 11th, 2001 and Hurricane Katrina, this paper documents specific scenarios in which people belonging to minority groups were communicatively excluded from emergency planning and evacuation. Avenues of further inquiry are proposed, regarding emergency perception and behavior among marginalized (and dominant) groups, in order to addressing some inequities during disaster situations."

The study suggested that the visible author identity significantly influenced peoples intentions to participate in political issues. Furthermore, when controlling for liking of the site, the visibility of the authorship also affected peoples agreement with the goal and content of the weblog.
In addition, the study found that the trustworthiness and clarity of the privacy policy on the weblog were strong and positive predictors of perceived credibility, interest in the issue, and liking of the weblog."

The experiment was conducted in a 2(agent's self-disclosure: Disclosure vs. Non-Disclosure) by 4(participants' attachment styles). After interactions with the agent, participants evaluated their perceived closeness - inclusion of other in the self, subjective closeness, expectations of influences in future interaction, and trust  toward the agent.
The results are summarized as follows: 1) self-disclosure of an agent had a positive impact on perceived closeness toward the agent; 2) participants' attachment styles were related to perceived closeness; those with a dismissing style consistently perceived the agent as least intimate, while preoccupied and fearful as relatively intimate; 3) with respect to trust toward the agent, a significant interaction effect was found; preoccupied and fearful persons rated the agent as more trustworthy when they received self-disclosure from the agent than when they did not, whereas ratings of secure and dismissing persons were not affected by agent's self-disclosure. These results show that self-disclosure of an agent and users' attachment styles affect relationship formation in the user-agent context, similar to findings in human relationship. Theoretical and practical (agent design) implications are discussed."
2007-0233,Cluster Analysis of Cancer Blog Users,Weblogs: Users and Their Motivations,,,,Paper,Cluster Analysis of Cancer Blog Users,Weblogs: Users and Their Motivations,"This study was undertaken to discover whether cancer blog users could be clustered in terms of demographic characteristics, audience usage, motivation, behavioral changes, and perceptions of media use and credibility. The study further examined the optimal number of clusters and user characteristics that defined the clusters of not well understood cancer blog users. The data were collected through an online self-reporting survey. A total of 113 respondents completed the questionnaires between March 30, 2006 and June 30, 2006. An agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was then performed to group the 113 cases (respondents) on the 351 variables. Wards linkage method, squared binary Euclidean distance measures, and Mojenas Best-Cut were used to cluster groups in the given data set. Three clusters were found as an optimal number for the given data set. Cluster 1 was observed as new bloggers who were highly motivated for compiled cancer information, were least influenced by blogs, and were frequent online information seekers. Cluster 2 was long timers who sought traditional sources, such as medical libraries for cancer information. Cluster 3 included highly motivated individuals and those who sought blogs for medically related information. The most frequent behavioral changes were observed in this group. The study concluded that a cluster analysis was useful method for finding the natural grouping of not well understood cancer blog users. Further study with a larger sample on identifying distinct variables that defined clusters will provide better understanding of cancer blogs users."

Couples (N = 68 dyads) including one depressed individual completed interviews about the strategies partners use to help curtail depression and completed measures of codependency, mental health, and relational cohesiveness and satisfaction. A control group of nondepressed couples (N=68 individuals) completed the self-report measures only. Results indicate partial support for an association between codependency and more negatively valenced control strategies as well as more consistent sequences of negative strategies. Codependency is found to moderate over-time changes in control strategies, supporting the contention that codependency is an individual-level trait. In couples including one depressed individual, codependency predicts more depression, negative cognitions, and anxiety and predicts lower cohesiveness but more relational satisfaction. In comparison couples, the predicted relationships are not supported, suggesting codependency may be heightened when attributions for relational control are challenged."

The research is examining the relationship between a candidates coverage in the news mediasphere in comparison to the less formal and less organized blogosphere. The project investigates levels of coverage in the two spheres, the effect of events and policy statements, and the emergence of issues. Lastly, the project also evaluates the tone of the blogopshere, through content coding, in an attempt to locate and identify moments when the campaign becomes more hostile or negative."

However, we know little about potential cognitive-affective mediators of this association. Based on appraisal theory in general and the law of apparent reality in general, we hypothesized that more frequent exposure to sexually explicit online material would increase the perceived realism of such material (cognitive mediator), which, in turn, would intensify arousal during exposure to exposure to sexually explicit online material (affective mediator). Greater arousal, finally, would lead to more positive attitudes toward uncommitted sexual exploration. Drawing on a sample of 791 Dutch male adolescents aged 13  18, we tested our model with Structural Equation Modeling. Our results largely confirmed our model. The study suggests that cognitions and affects play an important role in the link between adolescents exposure to sexually explicit online material and sexual attitude formation."
2007-0237,Cognitive and Affective Processing of Political Campaign Messages,Campaign Communication,,,,Paper,Cognitive and Affective Processing of Political Campaign Messages,Campaign Communication,"This study examined the interaction between two different political involvements (cognitive versus affective) at two different levels (high versus low) and two different types of political campaign messages (issue-based versus image-based) from a campaign message processing perspective. Based on a conceptual model incorporating these three constraints, a 2 X 2 X 2 factorial design was employed. Approximately 330 participants were recruited at a large university located in a Midwestern U.S. city. They were randomly assigned to read either an issue-based or an image-based message describing a hypothetic political candidate, while each level of cognitive and affective political involvement was determined through self-report. Results showed that cognitive and affective political involvement interacted with political campaign message type in the realm of the dependent variable, attitude toward the political messages. Finally, implications of the results are discussed and future research directions suggested."

Models by L. J. Shrum (1997) and M. A. Shapiro and A. Lang (1991) provide insight about psychological processes underlying these effects. The current study extends these models by drawing upon current theories of cognition and by reconstructing a measure for television memory designed to assess how people forget information over time. Data are currently being collected. Theoretically, the cultivation effect should disappear for those with a better remote television memory, as these participants can better distinguish between the television world and the real world. Moreover, when asked to concentrate on providing accurate social reality estimates, participants with better remote memory should also provide more accurate responses, as they can distinguish between sources of social reality information (i.e., television and the real world)."

One of the few examples of successful collaboration in the last 12 years is one that started in UT Austin in 1994 with a meeting of scholars, media representatives and policy makers, and that resulted in the book Mass media and free trade: NAFTA and the cultural industries, edited by McAnany and Wilkinson. Some members of the original group continued working over the years with visits to each others campuses and with a joint graduate course on NAFTA and the mass media between the University of Quebec at Montreal, the University of Texas at Austin and the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey taught in 2001 via videoconference with one professor at each university and graduate students in each institution interacting with their counterparts on the sessions and through e-mail. The paper discusses in particular the collaboration between professors and students of the University of Texas at San Antonio and the Tecnológico de Monterrey (México) in organizing in 2004 the follow up of the NAFTA and the mass media seminar, this time in Monterrey, Mexico, to discuss the first ten years after the signing of NAFTA and its impact on the mass media and audiences of North America. Also, the paper discusses the experience of the Monarca project between several Quebecois universities and some Mexican universities to do comparative research on the supply of audiovisual media on both countries. The paper concludes with some suggestions about how to use experiences like these as models for more international collaboration among Canadian, US and Mexican communication scholars interested in analyzing and evaluating the current media policies, flows and patterns of consumption among the three countries."

Within this context, this research explored the memory narratives offered by Israel's leading commercial television channel on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day
The findings show that the characters that stand at the center of most nonnews items aired by channel 2 are clearly Holocaust victims. At the same time, through all 12 examined evenings not even one item focused on the fate of a victim of Nazi persecutions that is not Jewish. In terms of events that stand at the center of the narratives the most salient themes were the persecution and annihilation of Jews; the victims' survival efforts; and post-war commemoration of the memory of the Holocaust. In contrast, none of the items dealing with events that occurred during the war focused on armed resistance against the Nazi perpetrators.
An overview of channel 2's broadcasts on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day reveals the channel's lack of will, or inability to work Holocaust Memorial Day into its well known and extremely successful broadcasting formats and formulas. Hence, it seems as though the people who have shaped channels 2's Holocaust Memorial Day programming through the years assume that the best way to accumulate the symbolic capital that could be gained through broadcasting on that evening is to air programs that are perceived as utterly unrelated to channel 2."

This study examined effects of DTC antidepressant ads on college students perceived prevalence of the medical condition, beliefs about treatment options, and drug inquiry intention. Results showed that recalling DTC antidepressant ads was positively associated with heightened perceived prevalence and listing antidepressants as a primary treatment option. Possible consequences of such perceptions and theoretical implications involving application of availability heuristics into DTC ad exposure were discussed."

The results of this study illustrated that openness and positivity were the most commonly enacted maintenance behaviors over email. In addition, long-distance and geographically close family, friends, and romantic partners differed in the maintenance behaviors exhibited in their email correspondence. This study expands the literature in 3 ways: 1) it expands work on relational maintenance beyond face-to-face contact by examining how email is utilized to enact maintenance behaviors; 2) it examines relationships that originated off-line, comparing email use in long distance and geographically close family, friendships, and romantic relationships; and 3) it examines actual naturally occurring email content in interpersonal relationships rather than relying on self-report."
2007-0243,Colombian Efforts for Peace From Within: The Role of Communication Networks of Middle-Level Officials,Crossing Boundaries in Communication,,,,Work in Progress,Colombian Efforts for Peace From Within: The Role of Communication Networks of Middle-Level Officials,Crossing Boundaries in Communication,"This project cuts across the fields of Peace Studies and Communication. It seeks to systematically explore the infrastructure that sustains peace-building processes in this torn by violence country. The infrastructure is conceived as a web of communication networks consisting of and, in many ways, generated by middle level officials (heads of NGOs and other civic and religious leaders), a highly effective, yet often ignored group of actors that operate in a highly volatile environment. By studying the changes in this infrastructure over the course of five years (from 2002, when Alvaro Uribe was first elected president, onwards), we hope to deliver theoretical contributions informed by research rooted in different disciplines and to provide a rich methodological toolkit that will allow policy analysts and all parties involved in the Colombian negotiation/peace-building processes to (a) evaluate efforts underway and (b) to develop and implement infrastructure designs that may lead to better negotiation outcomes. While our focus is explicitly on Colombia, we hope to also generate recommendations for ongoing peace processes elsewhere."

A Theoretical Explication of Virtual Community and the Example of Craigslist,Online Communities and Organizations: New Theoretical Directions,,,,Paper,Commons or Gated Community? A Theoretical Explication of Virtual Community and the Example of Craigslist,Online Communities and Organizations: New Theoretical Directions,"Explicating theoretical concepts of Community, Virtual Community, The Commons, and Gatekeeping, exemplified in practice on craigslist, reveals the complexity of developing a virtual community as a commons. A virtual community that is grounded in a number of communities of place, craigslist is an innovative hybrid of the virtual and the real worlds, and stands at the forefront of community development in the Information Age. Specifically explored herein are the following issues: Does the openness of virtual communities threaten the principles on which they are based, creating a tragedy of the virtual commons? Do restrictions on free and open access in virtual communities transform them into the cyberspace equivalent of gated communities? Is there an acceptable balance to be struck in the design of virtual communities in order for them to continue to fulfill their missions as commons while protecting themselves from the tragedy of the commons?"

This study investigates how cultural groups may differ in their perceptions about preferred communication behavior toward certain outgroups, including humanoid social robots. It focuses on the importance attached to ""interactive consraints"" in conversation. For the primary goal of requesting, the following five interactive constraints are identified based on the past literature: (1) Concern for clarity, (2) Concern for avoiding hurting the hearer's feelings, (3) Concern for non-imposition, (4) Concern for avoiding negative evaluation by the hearer, and (5) Concern for effectiveness.
This research aimed to examine whether attitude towards robots overrule the previously established cultural differences affecting perceived importance of conversational constraints. Participants will be from individuals of diverse cultural backgrounds. Factors of familiarity and contact with robots will also be measured.
After being presented at random with one of the three request situations, participants will rate the perceived importance of each interactive constraint in that situation in relation to computer-generated robot and different out-group characters."
2007-0246,"Communicating Contradiction: US Public Diplomacy, Neo-Liberalism, and the War Against Terror",terrogating Media Neo-Liberalisms,,,,Paper,"Communicating Contradiction: US Public Diplomacy, Neo-Liberalism, and the War Against Terror",Interrogating Media Neo-Liberalisms,"Since September 11, 2001, the American state has initiated a significant expansion of its international public diplomacy operations with a particular focus on Muslim audiences. Proponents and critics of this initiative generally address the methods employed while overlooking core contradictions stemming from the policy itself. This paper addresses those contradictions in the context of foreign policy strategies promoting neo-liberal regulatory regimes for media overseas. In its efforts to promote American perspectives, the United States now is promoting free market media systems while, simultaneously, insisting that public sector media are necessary to redress the country's poor public image. The paper asks a number of questions: what does this policy communicate about the assumed nature and influence of private sector media? Is contemporary public diplomacy itself an implicit admission that commercial media misrepresent American culture? Is the apparent need for state propaganda also an indirect admission that the neo-liberal marketplace is not ideal and that the related concept of consumer sovereignty is in fact a myth? Finally, the paper asks if recent public diplomacy efforts, by problematizing otherwise unquestionable neo-liberal assertions, in effect de-legitimize the ideological framework surrounding post-Cold War US foreign economic policy  neo-liberalism itself?"
2007-0247,Communicating Risk: The Effects of Message Appeal and Individual Difference on Risk Message Processing,formation Systems: Persuasion by Negative Emotion,,,,Paper,Communicating Risk: The Effects of Message Appeal and Individual Difference on Risk Message Processing,Information Systems: Persuasion by Negative Emotion,"The purpose of the present study is to test how message appeal and individual difference affects risk perception and risk message processing. In a 2 (message appeal: emotional vs. logical) by 2 (MBSS: monitor vs. blunter) between subject experiment, the main and the interaction effects of the two independent variables were tested. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) indicated a significant main effect of message appeal on dependent measures, such that participants perceived higher risk, higher probability of risk occurrence, and showed more accurate recognition memory from emotional appeal messages. We also found significant interaction effects of message appeal by MBSS on perceived risk and perceived probability of risk occurrence. Our findings suggest that public policy makers and risk communicators pay more attention to different message appeals in designing risk messages, and further explore how different message appeals and individual difference of the public affects risk perception and risk message processing. Implication for future research is discussed in a public-risk message design context."

It analyzes stories as a site of social interaction where the teacher actively shapes the style and code of communication. Both children and the teacher interact according to a recognizable speech code, privileging the mother tongue. Furthermore, childrens narratives display an understanding of the social world that is asymmetric, allocentric, and defined and evaluated by adults. Children may resist indirectly and silently. These findings demonstrate a Vygotskian theory of learning which also displays the continuation of Confucian values."
2007-0250,Communication as a Right and the History of Ideas,Creating Communication Rights: Perspectives on the Emergence of a Global Social Movement,,,,Paper,Communication as a Right and the History of Ideas,Creating Communication Rights: Perspectives on the Emergence of a Global Social Movement,"The communication rights concept has gained recognition in recent years as a comprehensive formula to indicate all those rights that pertain to communication processes in society, grounded in principles of diversity, inclusion, openness and participation. Yet the concept emerges from former debates, theoretical reflections and political discourses that have contributed to framing communication, information exchange and knowledge production as social processes that play a central role in contemporary societies and therefore explicitly emerge as sites of struggle between different interests, interpretations and visions. Concepts related to communication transformations and societal change, such as the information society and the digital divide, have been proposed over time and have become keywords in political discourses, despite being conceptually under-theorized and assumed as neutral representations of societal transformations. This paper offers a critical review of the history of some central ideas that can be considered, both in positive and negative terms, at the root of communication rights struggles."

Despite conflicts aversive effects, couples are not always able to resolve their conflicts in a single encounter and often extend issues over time. These reoccurring argumentative episodes are known as serial arguing (Trapp & Hoff, 1985). Aspects of serial arguing have been linked with both relational difficulties and individual well-being. This study explores how aspects of serial arguments, including destructive and constructive communication enacted during argumentative episodes are linked with individuals physical and mental well-being. Mutual hostility was found to be detrimental, as it was positively related to stress, intrusive thoughts, hyperarousal, avoiding thoughts about the encounter, sleeping problems, anxiety, cutting down on daily activities due to emotional and physical problems, and physical pain. Constructive communication was related only to a reduction in hyperarousal and avoidance. The present analysis provides evidence that communication during serial arguing is related to physical and mental health. Limitations of the study and avenues for future research are also discussed."

While differences in values, norms, and language make the process problematic, power inequalities and negative historical relationships are far more difficult to overcome. The purpose of this study was to develop theory to describe how First Nations and the governments of Canada and British Columbia engage in communication for relationship building. A set of theoretical propositions are posited. Findings from the present study can be utilized in other public dialogue contexts where the importance of increased participation from marginalized groups is recognized."
2007-0255,Communication Issues and Communicative Self-Efficacy for Sustainable Telework: An Empirical Study,Explaining Technologies,,,,Paper,Communication Issues and Communicative Self-Efficacy for Sustainable Telework: An Empirical Study,Explaining Technologies,"This paper discusses the results of an empirical study administered via the Internet both Australian and North American teleworkers (N=150 useable responses). Factor analysis and regression analysis, were used to isolate predictor variables for teleworker productivity from a range of demographic, communication, and self-efficacy variables. Assessed were a wide range of relevant variables across teleworkers personal, work, technological, organisational, and domestic (life-style) domains. The following discussion, however, is limited to the isolation of core communication constructs that teleworkers report as being significant to their remote work arrangements. Factor analysis revealed six communication constructs that teleworks say are relevant to their work life.
 Importance of communication for social/career influence.
 Satisfaction with communication for social/career influence.
 Satisfaction with both managerial and coworker support.
 Dissatisfaction with informal communication; and
 Importance and satisfaction with communication technologies.
 Managing communication with supervisor
However, none of these communication variables predicted telework productivity. Rather, self-efficacy beliefs did. One of these - task mediation through others- relates to self-efficacy in relation to task oriented peer communication. The study suggests that a constellation of communication processes are needed to support telework but that, more importantly, individuals need to be carefully assessed for their confidence in working in this way."

Among its original (and continuing) goals is the dissemination of communication knowledge and research summaries among developing countries and religious communication professionals. Acknowledging this 25th anniversary, the staff of Trends now seeks new ways to reach its constituent audiences and to bring more international scholars into its values-based research approaches. Recruiting Third World researchers to write for Trends would bring them into contact with others, including U.S. and European researchers, who are working in the same areas. The primary focus of Trends is an in-depth review of a body of communication literature in a single long article. This being the case, international scholars would be able to contribute to the knowledge of U.S. and European scholars. Websites, wikis, and digital publication offer new opportunities for this old publication."

It outlines the main features of the communication and media policy contexts in the decades 1975-2005 with the aim of clarifying how structures of political opportunities have changed over the years, in terms of inclusiveness and openness to actors and issues, fostering or constraining collective action in trans-national spaces. It contributes to the historical review of social mobilizations around information, knowledge and culture by looking at global communication governance as a stage characterized by distinctive features, on which collective action has taken place for some time and developed practices of critical framing in relation to processes and issues that have become central to contemporary struggles on the broader global scene: the sharing of knowledge as a basis for human development, the idea of information as a common good and participation in policy-definition as a way to fulfill human rights."

Telecommunications and Global Knowledge Issues,,,,Paper,Communications Authority: A Panacea for Hong Kong Communication Law and Policy?,Competition or Regulation? Telecommunications and Global Knowledge Issues,"In March 2006, the Hong Kong Government announced a merger of the telecommunications and broadcasting regulators into a unified Communications Authority. This paper examines three issues: firstly, how did the communication law and policy evolve in Hong Kong? Next, what are the governments proposals on the establishment of the Communications Authority? Finally, what are the current issues in Hong Kong communications law and policy and whether the establishment of the Communications Authority can address these problems? The authors of this paper argue that whilst the establishment of the Communications Authority represents a step in the right direction, it will not solve all problems existing in Hong Kong communication sectors, such as the absence of a general competition law, the increased influence from Mainland China and the lack of public service broadcasting policy. More reforms are necessary before Hong Kong can maintain its status a communication hub in China and Asia."

Measures of General Social Support (GenSS), Support from a Significant Other (SOR), Support from AA, (AASup), and Support from an AA sponsor (SponsR) were assessed in relationship to a four dimensional measure of EQL. Prospective cross-lag panel analyses were used to predict relationships over time and nonrecursive structural equation models were used to examine simultaneous reciprocal relationships between the variables. GenSS predicted General Emotional Quality of Life (GEQL) and Happiness, and was influenced in turn by GEQL. SOR predicted Happiness, but was not influenced by EQL. AASup predicted GEQL, Happiness, and Anger, but was not influenced by EQL."

In line with the premises of the SEM model (Tesser, 1988) and the STTUC framework (Exline & Lobel, 1999), study 1 predicted and found that people tend to conceal and play down their achievements in conversation with a person whom they have outperformed, especially when the field of performance is relevant to this individual and irrelevant to them. Study 2 found that the perception of outperformers is dependant not only on their communicative behaviors following the success but also on the relevance of the field for them and for the perceivers."

Participants completed a difficult math test after reading one of three coping messages: A control message encouraging perseverance, a suppression message describing stereotype threat and instructing participants to suppress associated thoughts, and a replacement message describing the phenomenon and presenting an alternative, self-relevant positive stereotype. As predicted, a performance gap favoring males was observed in the control condition. This gap widened when students attempted to suppress threatening thoughts, but narrowed when they were primed with the alternative positive stereotype. Our results demonstrate that priming a positive achieved identity (e.g., private college student) can subdue anxiety associated with ascribed identities (e.g., female)."
2007-0264,"Community Intermediary Organizations, Community Media and Networking, and the Internet",Online Communities and Organizations: New Theoretical Directions,,,,Paper,"Community Intermediary Organizations, Community Media and Networking, and the Internet",Online Communities and Organizations: New Theoretical Directions,"Across Canada, thousands of community ""intermediary"" organizations act as links between the various levels of government and Canadians, often people experiencing poverty, health problems, social isolation and other forms of disadvantage. Community intermediary organizations produce community media to publicize to the larger society the issues and events they believe are important and they network with each other and with their community members to share information and coordinate their activities. This paper explores the community media and networking activities of four community intermediary organizations in four different Canadian provinces, and the role of the Internet in these activities. For our analysis we draw on fieldwork data including transcripts from interviews and focus groups as well as content analysis of texts produced by the organizations. Our research situates these community intermediary organizations as actors within wider social movements and considers their community media and networking activities in this context. The research contributes understanding about how the Internet is used by this specific group of social movement actors - community intermediary organizations - and the challenges, opportunities and barriers to using the Internet for their community media and networking activities."

In taking up this argument, I review academic thinking on the public sphere, especially as it relates to the field of media studies. Here, I describe the basic features of contemporary media culture that have prompted questions regarding the very existence, let alone the viability, of the public sphere. Throughout, I draw upon the work of scholars who challenge Habermass historical account of a single, inclusive public sphere, but who, nevertheless, acknowledge the concepts utility to democratic theory. This discussion provides an appropriate context to evaluate community medias role in constructing discursive spaces for groups and individuals marginalized by dominant media institutions and practices."

As significant opportunities open up in the digital realm for content creation and distribution the vast majority of radio listeners still rely on analog FM receivers. While maintaining their FM broadcasts, community radio stations are taking advantage of new opportunities in the digital realm that level technological barriers and open up new opportunities for voice. Non-linear editing has made music and news production more accessible, and the move away from satellite downlinks to web-based distribution platforms have opened up a world of non-affiliated programming content that brings down overhead and increases diversity of perspective. This paper explores the ways that community radio stations have made use of digital tools in increasing participation, broadening perspectives, and ultimately defining community."

In an attempt to explain the song contests popularity, this article analyses the content of two seasons of the Dutch version of Idols, with particular attention to the ritual structure. The content analysis shows that the ritual meaning of Idols lies in the representation of harmony and ranking. By criticising and disgracing bad contestants as a ritual of abjection, while at the same time glorifying the battle of the finalists as a classic rite of passage, an imaginary community is created with a fixed social order and a definable morality. Idols is thus able to serve as a platform for the articulation, representation and discussion of contemporary values."

Consistent with the previous research, the results indicate that auto-stereotypes are generally more positive than hetero-stereotypes. However, hetero-stereotypes in the Russia and Alaska samples differed in two significant ways. The discriminant analysis suggests that the respondents rely on positive auto-stereotypes and negative hetero-stereotypes when assessing cultural shyness. The discriminant analysis also reveals the correlation between age and cultural shyness. Based on these findings, implications for intercultural research are presented."

Hallin and Paolo Mancini in their important work Comparing Media Systems  Three Models of Media and Politics. Furthermore, the paper discusses distinct features of media and politics-relations in the Nordic countries and attempts to identify key factors constraining or promoting a possible liberalization or hybridization of the media systems in Nordic countries. The empirical data is based on a secondary analysis of available media statistics in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. A comparative approach is used to analyze whether the Nordic countries actually meet the standards of the Democratic Corporativist Model or if they are drifting towards a more liberal media model. The main conclusion of this paper is that the Nordic media systems are becoming more liberal due to diminished influences from governments and political parties. However, traditional Nordic media institutions remain strong and have been successful in adapting to new conditions thus creating new hybrids of the Nordic and the Liberal media models."

The prevalence of various Web production practices by five types of political actors (parties, candidates, news media, government entities, and nongovernmental organizations), were correlated with indicators of economic development, technological development, political development, and political culture. Unsurprisingly, the level of technological development was positively related to each Web production practice examined. However, we found that the type of political actor producing a site was more potent than human development, technological development, and political culture variables in explaining web production practices. At the same time, we found that political culture has significant influence on how
web production practices are implemented within national contexts. Differences in political participation and political engagement among the citizenry corresponded with differences in political actors web production practices."

Two distinct conceptual approaches have developed. Brokerage views social capital as a source of individual advantage gained through network position, while closure views social capital as having a more general benefit to the organization. This study analyzes the evolution of a communication network using data collected at 13 points in time over a 2-year period. Conceptually, we incorporate both of the 2 dominant perspectives to social capital (brokerage and closure), examining whether network actors will over time initiate communication ties to enact both structures. Methodologically, we utilize the Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis (SIENA) computer program (Boer, Huisman, Snijders, & Zeggelink, 2003), which allows examination of the simultaneous and dynamic influences of various mechanisms on a network. Our results suggest network members seek to enact ties that forge closure while avoiding brokerage."
2007-0280,Complaint Talk: An Actual Site of Social Organization,Creating Communicative Opportunity Within and Between Many Languages,,,,Paper,Complaint Talk: An Actual Site of Social Organization,Creating Communicative Opportunity Within and Between Many Languages,"This study examines, using a conversation analytic framework, how Korean speakers carry out the action of complaining in naturally-occurring talk. What I mean by complaining in this study is an action of expressing dissatisfaction concerning the addressees behavior. The speaker expresses dissatisfaction because the target behavior fails to meet his or her expectations, or he or she considers it to have violated socio-cultural norms. The complaining action is thus an actual site of social organization in which socio-cultural norms are dynamically embodied in concrete shapes. This study explores this dynamic area of human conduct, by investigating how social participants interactively negotiate and constitute social organization, including identities and memberships, in the course of talk-in-interaction. Following the CA and ethnomethodological research that has investigated the relationship between talk-in-interaction and social organization, this study takes the perspective that social life is the business that people conduct with each other, displayed in their everyday practices, and social identities and relations are what participants create, define, negotiate, maintain, and therefore do through interaction. This study shows that the participants relevantly raise and interactionally accomplish particular social identities and memberships at various steps in the complaining activity. It thus argues that social organization needs to be accounted for in actual episodes of interaction based on the specific aspects that the participants make relevant to their ongoing actions at the particular moments."
2007-0281,"Compliance, Accommodation, and Trust in an Intergroup Context: International Data",Developing and Extending Models of Intergroup Communication (Top Papers),,,,Paper,"Compliance, Accommodation, and Trust in an Intergroup Context: International Data",Developing and Extending Models of Intergroup Communication (Top Papers),"Police-civilian interactions have recently been investigated from an intergroup communication perspective. While much past research has shown that civilians' sociodemographic characteristics predict attitudes toward police, recent work in the USA has revealed that perceptions of police officers' communication accommodation can be a better predictor than these measures. The current study continued this line of work in Korea, Japan, Guam, and Canada and tested a theoretical model aimed at exploring the role of communication accommodation in voluntary compliance with police. A total of 684 university students completed a questionnaire that assessed how accommodating they perceived police to be together with their reported trust in, and inclinations to comply with, them. For each location, structural equation models were tested. The findings indicated that, for all locations, perceived police officer communication accommodation predicted trust in police which, in turn, predicted attitudes about compliance with police requests. The theoretical and applied significance of the findings are discussed."
2007-0282,Comprehension of the Media,ghts Into Media Comprehension,,,,Paper,Comprehension of the Media,Insights Into Media Comprehension,"When people watch a movie, one of the viewers basic goals is to have a coherent understanding of what they are watching. To accomplish this, viewers construct mental representations of the movie as the movie unfolds. This representation includes information about the characters and situations within the movie, and prior expectations based on knowledge about the genre of movies, the director, and/or the actors and actresses starring in the movie. This combination of information provides the basis for understanding the movie as it unfolds and for predicting future events in the movie. Unfortunately, little research has focused on how people create a coherent understanding of what they are watching. That is, communication scholars have tended to ignore comprehension. In this paper we present three research traditions that have sought to understand how we comprehend the media. One tradition can be traced back to Stuart Halls (2001/1980) essay on the encoding/decoding model, which arose within British cultural studies. This research tradition focuses on the global comprehension and representation of media stories. A second tradition focuses on relationships between characters within a story and their role in forming a unified mental representation of the story. A third tradition focuses on the role of situation models in the comprehension of visual and text stories. These three traditions approach comprehension differently, each with their own methodologies. This paper will present each tradition, focusing on their theoretical and methodological contributions to understanding how we understand the media."

Intercultural Issues in News Coverage","Extensive media-movement literature addressed the intersection of news framing, social change and social control. However, the role of media other than mainstream in social activism has been largely ignored. This study aims to explore how the cultural values of the Chinese community and the mainstream society were reflected and transmitted in the Chinese and English-languages media in a social change issue. This study employs the Centering Resonance Analysis (CRA), a computer-assisted qualitative network-based text analysis approach, to process a comprehensive collection of news coverage from both the English and Chinese-language newspapers. The comparison of the content was carried out at both macro and micro level, i.e. the general themes and specific words. Cultural values that contributed to the differences and similarities of the news coverage were discussed."

We identified three variables that may mediate the influence of CMC on interpersonal attraction: similarity, self-disclosure, and direct questioning. Focusing on these potential mediating variables, we formulated and tested three explanatory hypotheses: the CMC-induced similarity hypothesis, CMC-induced direct questioning hypothesis, and CMC-induced self-disclosure hypothesis. Eighty-one cross-sex dyads were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: text-only CMC, visual CMC, and face-to-face communication. We did not find a direct effect of CMC on interpersonal attraction. However, we did find two positive indirect effects of text-only CMC on interpersonal attraction: Text-only CMC stimulated both self-disclosure and direct questioning, which in turn both enhanced interpersonal attraction. Results are discussed in light of uncertainty reduction theory and CMC theories."

This study focuses on CMC in relationship maintenance between geographically separated friends who established their friendships in previous face-to-face (FtF) interactions. A central relational maintenance strategy  self-disclosure was examined in both FtF and CMC contexts.
Data from a heterogeneous sample of 353 individuals via a web survey elucidated associations among media consumption, FtF self-disclosure, CMC disclosure, sex, cultural values, geographic distance, CMC competence, and relationship quality.
Results of the study suggested that CMC is an invaluable yet unique alternative in maintaining long-distance friendships. At least in the areas where internet has higher social penetration, CMC has been integrated into everyday life and plays a crucial role in maintaining relationships with distant friends. These findings contribute to both theoretical and empirical development in related research areas."

Employing content analysis and in-depth interviews, this study found that CMSS is an efficient and valuable supplement to traditional social support for international migrants. CMSS occurs frequently in the forums and four types of CMSS sought by migrants were identified  informational CMSS, emotional CMSS, tangible CMSS, and companionship CMSS. Among the four types of CMSS, informational CMSS occurs most frequently, followed by tangible CMSS. The responsiveness to CMSS seeking attempts varies with seekers CMSS providing record and seekers social support need perceived by potential providers. The in-depth interviews found that convenience, availability, anonymity, and message archiving were the main drivers of seeking CMSS. The reasons of not seeking CMSS varied very much with individuals. It could be personality, could also be unawareness."

An online survey was conducted with 86 college students participated. The findings indicated that people might develop diverse relationships with their computers. The computer-computer relationship types identified in this study were: social relationship, working relationship, acquaintance, mixed relationship and enemy. The natures of these relationships were: warm, love-hate, neutral and cold. People also developed emotional ties with their computers. The interactions between human-computer relationship type, human-computer relationship nature, computer use and computer activities were examined. The finding suggested that human-computer relationship type and nature do influence computer use. This study proposed a new perspective on human-computer interaction. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed."

For the most part, this has involved providing computers with rules of grammar, knowledge about the world and heuristic rules that will help them understand and use natural language. But while knowledge of the world and of grammar are important, a cursory review of the literature suggests that there is more to this process than we might have imagined. The development of computers that translate from one language into another or communicate with us to solve advanced problems and tasks might benefit from an improved understanding of how communication works."

Therefore, not just the result, but also how it was attained (i.e., the implicit or explicit methodology in the broad sense of the word) and the subsequent uses to which the result is put, should all be scrutinized as to their impact on the nature of what is visually represented and the ways in which this representation can be em-ployed. Visual representations in science differ significantly in terms of how they relate to what they purport to represent (i.e., their representational and ontological status); the means, processes, and methods by which they are produced; the normative contexts involved; the purposes served; and the many ways in which they are used and combined, to name but some of the more crucial aspects. This paper develops a conceptual framework for a more thorough and conscious investigation of visual representational practices within the different discourses of scientific data representation, conceptualization, and scholarly and public communication."

A Comparative Study of Media Coverage Versus the Perception of the State of the Economy in Germany and U.S.,New Developments in Agenda Setting Theory and Research - 35 Years Later,"Agenda setting has already been applied to a broad range of issues, but so far few studies have focused on the macro-economic context. Indeed, few researchers in this field have shown how coverage can act as a potential preparatory indicator of consumer confidence. Our study follows an international comparative approach based on quantitative content analysis of the main television news in Germany and the U.S and their respective coverage on the state of the economy. The analysis comprises all broadcasts from seven German and four U.S. news programs from 2003 to 2006. This data was correlated with opinion polls on consumer expectations in both countries. Despite significant differences in the coverage on the economy, the results indicate an impact on consumers perceptions. The paper will discuss the impact of the quantity, the tone and the topic structure of the reports on TV audiences."

Study 1 found that confirmation by parents was positively related to mid-adolescents psychosocial adjustment. Structural equation modeling in Study 2 showed that, collectively, confirmation by parents as well as siblings was related to late-adolescents psychosocial adjustment. Analyses examining parent and sibling confirmation levels separately suggested that confirmation by siblings plays a larger role than parental confirmation during late-adolescence. However, inclusion of all family members levels of confirmation better predicted adolescent adjustment than any individual family members confirmation. Further, different members appeared to contribute to different dimensions of adolescents psychosocial adjustment. Implications of the 2 studies are compared and discussed."

Following the definition given by Entman (1993), this study applied a modified classification of frames according to the dimensions cooperation/agreement vs. conflict/disagreement. The agreement/disagreement dimension is used if the frame refers to the position of the journalist, while the cooperation/conflict dimension is applied for coding the events being reported. It was hypothesized that the uses of frames varies among different journalistic cultures (in this case, the Mediterranean or Polarized Pluralist Model vs. the North European or Democratic Corporatist Model). In fact, this study found differences that can be interpreted along the lines of the factors that characterize the two journalistic cultures, particularly the relationship between journalists and politicians."

Our exploratory study largely confirmed that the variables depicted in the model are at play in the lived reality of young adult women when they experience conflict with a female stranger, thus providing external validity for our conceptualizations. A content analysis of seven focus group conversations among a total of 38 female U.S. college students indicated that such conflicts are common occurrences, and occur more frequently in situations where physical appearance is privileged. Ps identified five primary factors that facilitate such conflicts, (competition, differences/similarities, expectancy violations, perceived threats, and standards for appearance and behavior set by media and society). Further, the Ps reported specific nonverbal and verbal strategies used to communicate perceived potential conflict as well as to escalate and deescalate these conflicts."

This study sought to test whether conflict in the family of origin and in the present marriage could substantiate the poor marriage material hypothesis by discriminating between couples in their first marriage versus those in a marriage with a history of divorce. A sample of 66 newly wed married couples, half in first marriages and half in remarriages, were recruited through marriage licenses and student referrals. Family of origin conflict discriminated between first and remarried couples. Namely, wives exposure to interparental conflict significantly increased the odds that they were presently married to a husband who had previously been divorced. Differences between first and remarried couples own conflict patterns were largely unremarkable with the exception of remarried couples seeing their partners as being more compliant and unassertive relative to those in first marriages."

Previous studies have found that such a moderating role of political discussion has both positive and negative effects which have lead to the development of two competing models: the differential gains model of media use and the communication confusion model. In this study, I examine the influence of the interaction between political discussion and news use on citizens level of knowledge on presidential candidate issue stance during the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign using data from the National Annenberg Election Study (NAES). I examine different contexts for political discussion (family, work, or online), different forms of media (national television news, 24-hour cable news, newspaper, and online news), and, in taking advantage of the rolling-cross sectional survey design of the NAES, I examine fluctuations in relationship over time throughout the 2004 presidential campaign. Results provide evidence for the communication confusion model. This model, however, is not static throughout the campaign. Additional exploratory analyses are conducted and discussed."

How Exposure to Disagreement Moderates the Effects of Political Discussion and Media Use on Candidate Knowledge,Discussion & Disagreement,,,,Paper,Confusion or Enlightenment? How Exposure to Disagreement Moderates the Effects of Political Discussion and Media Use on Candidate Knowledge,Discussion & Disagreement,"Recent research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between interpersonal discussion and media use in the production of political knowledge. This study seeks to better illuminate this relationship by introducing political disagreement as an additional moderator. Using nationally representative survey data collected during the 2000 U.S. presidential primary campaign, we find a negative interaction between discussion frequency and disagreement in predicting knowledge of candidate issue positions. This pattern suggests either that the benefits of frequent discussion are stronger for those whose discussion networks are comprised primarily of like-minded others or that disagreement facilitates learning only at low levels of discussion frequency. Results also demonstrate that frequent interpersonal discussion enhances the relationship between debate viewing and issue knowledge among those who reside in politically homogenous networks. In diverse networks, however, the relationship between debate viewing and issue knowledge is weaker for those who talk regularly about politics than those who talk less. Political disagreement is unassociated with knowledge of candidates personal backgrounds."

This research extends new collective action theory to explain the pattern of hyperlinks among social movement organizations. Then, this research explores the pattern of hyperlink ties among 48 English Speaking Islamic Resistance organizations. We found that the oldest websites are the most central in the hyperlink network. Additionally, we found that generalist organizations, or organizations with have multiple social goals, were more likely to be hubs among generalist organizations, authorities for specialist organizations, and positively influenced the formation of hyperlinks among organizations to which it hyperlinks. Cumulatively, this research demonstrates that the oldest organizations and generalist organizations are key contributors to connective collective action online."

The framework of this conquest implies an identified evil villain, who can be vanquished through the righteous acts of transcendent heroes. The articulation of ethnicity, intersecting with nationality, religious affiliation and gender, accentuates critical markers of difference within these texts. How different communities come to understand and engage these texts needs to be examined. This study explores how Arab American and other audiences interpret heroes and villains in action-adventure film through focus group research."

Central to these media is a spiritualized call for worldviews of personal transformation as the pathway to global social change. These (primarily print) media have begun to go beyond their original circulation to include interpersonal communicative action through Internet-based pods or groups, salons, conferences-as community, and traveling seminars. These efforts reflect practices that evolved from the New Age and 1960s social movements articulating values about the environment, human rights, social justice and the true relational nature of our lives with that of the other and with the natural world. This paper explores the community-building work and visions of the LOHAS trade and consumer media to further understanding of how emergent spirituality takes shape through media commodification and the implications of that for social action."

The Ideodynamics of Public Opinion and Computer-Mediated Communication","Partisanship, Polarization, and Ideology","This paper explores the impact of opinion on communication by measuring public opinion polls against Usenet newsgroup discussions from 1993 through 2004. Despite poll results during this time period consistently showing 1.7 times more conservative self-identification than liberal, the ratio of self-assertions of liberalism to conservatism in Internet postings was 1.0 for the time period from 1993 through 1996. Interestingly, from 1997 to 2004, liberal self-expressions became more common than conservative self-expressions, with the ratio increasing to 1.4. Therefore, contrary to what Noelle-Neumanns spiral of silence theory might predict, conservative opinion did not suppress liberal self-assertions online. Noelle-Neumanns theory has an implicit but essentially unmentioned assumption, namely that circumstances remain static. However, the real world is dynamic with new ideas arising and the environment changing so that sometimes old, out-of-favor ideas can become more attractive. Therefore, an analysis of self-expression should also include theories of diffusion which can explicitly consider minority ideas increasing in the face of majority dominance. In this paper, this is illustrated by the increase in liberal self-expressions online at a time when public opinion poll results showed a conservative dominance. While the spiral of silence, diffusion theories, and literature arguing for the significance of anonymity on the Internet may separately be effective for helping to explain rates of self-expression under specific circumstances, the ideodynamic model provides a complete picture for better understanding societal shifts in self-expression more broadly by considering the context of a dynamic world in which both old and new ideas are constantly competing to become part of the zeitgeist."

The theoretical discussion is carried out in the context of analysis of images of Abu Ghraib. Firstly, the images of Abu Ghraib are analysed as rituals of torture and sacrifice in the frame of contemporary news journalism. Secondly, the constitution of the social is discussed through the act of looking by elaborating the ideas of French social theorist Georges Bataille  about how social life is construed through the shared experience of horror and disgust in front of the visual representation of death. I will argue that the images of Abu Ghraib can be considered to function as a ritualized orgy and a spectacle of death  enforcing the logic of libidinal economy at work within contemporary media power."

However, it has been difficult for social scientists to measure and describe the extent to which political opinion leader influence voters, especially when voters today access multiple information sources like communication networks and self-selected news media. This paper fills this gap by using agent-based modeling to represent what the two-step flow theory describes about opinion leader influence and refines the theory based on the findings. First, opinion leader influence does not diffuse to the public without homogeneous communication networks. Second, opinion leader influence usually does not diffuse widely to the public because it inevitably faces resistance from self-strengthening communication networks."

Using the notion of imagined space (Allen, 1999), I examine the imaginative construction of the cultural space of Japan as an alternative playground (hooks, 1992, p. 23) in which the main characters lostness is metaphorically represented, and their nostalgia for what they have lost are evoked and fulfilled through the Orientalist and imperialist gaze. Through such representations, the discursive and performative practices of white hegemonic marking and making of space are nurtured, reinforced, and concealed. The imagined cultural space of Japan is an alternative playground in which the characters enters into the experience of temporal self-transformation and spiritual renewal. The construction of imagined cultural space in this film is an assertion and reproduction of power in which the spatiality of Japan is imaginatively colonized and used to serve white subjectivity."

In doing so, they also construct normal/deviant dichotomies. This study investigates construction of Palestinian political violence in U.S. news media within the second Palestinian intifada. It sheds light on medias role as agents of social control and influence by examining labels on violence committed by various parties and the use of primordial- and instrumental-type explanations of national identity and mobilization, among others. Two key intifada moments were picked: Israeli Prime Minister Sharons visit to the Jerusalem shrine and assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Zeevi. Analysis indicated journalist attachment of terrorism exclusively to Palestinians, undermining Palestinian violence as legitimate resistance means. Also, religious and secular identities were conflated in attempting to identify parties of the conflict thereby mishandling the primordial paradigm. News medias role in social control and influence is thus undeniable, but the adequacy thereof is a separate question."

The purpose of this study is to extend the theory of relationship management to the Chinese context by investigating the types of relationships between organizations and their Chinese publics, strategies the organizations use to cultivate the relationships, and the relationship between cultivation strategies and types of OPRs. This study is a metaresearch that reports a meta-analysis of three studies on relationship management with publics in mainland China and Hong Kong. By comparing original qualitative and quantitative data from the perspectives of organizations and publics, the result shows that eight relationship types appear in the OPRs with the Chinese publics even though covenantal and mutual communal relationships seem least obvious from the publics point of view. In addition, both types and dimensions of OPRs should be used to best explicate the nature of OPRs with various publics. Five additional strategies are employed in cultivating OPRs with the Chinese publics: being attentive, education, personal relationships, keeping promises/organizational credibility, and adherence to relational and cultural rules. The meta-analysis of this research does not suggest a clear relationship between cultivation strategies and types of OPRs. Interestingly, participants from mainland China and Hong Kong report a conflicting result on the symmetrical cultivation strategies effect on exchange relationships."

At the same time, these websites are becoming important sources of marketing intelligence for companies. Drawing on the concept of media richness, this paper investigates how such websites could provide richer and more useful exchanges to both consumers and companies. It examines a sample of consumer-opinion websites by looking at the immediacy of feedback, the multiplicity of cues, language variety, and personal focus. The results suggest that consumer-opinion websites can provide richer exchanges by offering different interaction formats for information exchange and social interactions and by tailoring their richness features to the complexity of the tasks users seek to perform."

Olmos and his partners, Time Warner and the Smithsonian Institution. Americanos attempts to combat the negative stereotypes and marginalization that characterize Latina/o media representation by using positive and depoliticized imagery. This paper argues that the positive lens of Americanos, like other instances of the so-called Latin pop explosion, works within liberal multiculturalism to produce a transcultural and celebratory Latinidad without addressing structural power. Interviews with visitors to the Americanos photography exhibit in Los Angeles demonstrate the seduction of positive imagery, but Chicana/o college student responses also show how cultural capital can cultivate more critical and oppositional readings of difference."

I am also concerned with the appropriation of white trash stereotypes by the mainstream entertainment and consumer spheres in the United States. After defining and historicizing the phenomenon of white trash, I turn my attention to its presence in popular culture representations, exploring both the subversive and conservative possibilities of a popular aesthetic of white trash.
Ultimately, I am interested in whether whiteness scholar Allen Bérubé is correct in thinking that the current fascination with white trash opens up a civic space for challeng[ing] the class-based stereotypes that hurt real people. It has been the project of critical whiteness studies to make whiteness visible as a racial identity category and to deconstruct its attendant economic and social privileges. Because of its broad visibility in media and consumer culture, I argue that the popular appropriation of white trash identity should be an important object of analysis for whiteness studies in its pursuit of raising critical consciousness."

By content analyzing 145 university Web sites, this study finds that the amount of types of information intended for international students on the university Web sites is correlated with the international student population at the institutions (r = .36). The top 5 frequently provided information intended for international students are information of Immigration/visa/SEVIS, Electronic form/handbook/brochure, Admission, Workshop/event/study program, and Housing. The development of interactivity level on the U.S. university Web sites had fallen behind and can be much improved to provide more and better online services for their prospective and current international students."

I rely on Lacans theory of the subject, Gramscis discussion of agency in a hegemonic state and Foucaults discussion of subjectivity to suggest that observation or surveillance inevitably lead to subjectivization of the observed and, paradoxically, help instill or restore agency in those under observation and surveillance. Additionally, I discuss Bourdieus notions of Habitus and Field and his argument of the productivity of the field and argue that the structuring structures potential of the online Field calls into question the uniformity and stability of power relations present in the panoptic theory. The paper concludes with a call for a further exploration of the roles and relations in online educational interactions and a thorough (re)examination of the assumptions about agency, individualism, and subjectivity. These seem to be necessary conditions for any competent and truthful discussion of power, online and off."

1. Several research perspectives argue for the importance of contextualising media use but provide few cues as to how to treat context. I argue that it is analytically fruitful to link our understanding of context to Wittgensteins language games. Furthermore I suggest that the insights of Wittgenstein might be merged with Bourdieus field, and Clifford Geertz thick description. This combination can provide the theoretical, analytical and methodological toolbox for a proper understanding of the importance and nature of context.
2. Taking context  implying that meanings, and hence also perceptions shift with shifting settings  seriously it follows that conventional ideas of persons as individuals (i.e. indivisible) are misleading. I suggest that persons should be understood as an ever-shifting tension between individual and dividual qualities. Dividual is meant to grasp analytically the fact that we are different media users depending on the communicative context we are parts of."

It is argued that contextual factors have contributed to the different trajectories of the two movements. A content analysis on selected discursive data demonstrates the significance of social, economic, and political elements in shaping womens movements in these two countries which have seemingly identical cultural backgrounds."

Contingency theory argued that the complexity in strategic communication was best represented by a continuum of stance, not by a limited set of models of excellence. This metatheoretical analysis, while acknowledging the inspiration of the excellence theory, celebrates the maturing of the contingency theory by consolidating the development and advances the theory has made since 1997; documents the discoveries that have either added new insights to the theory or refuted postulations; charts the streams of research that have been extended and expanded from the original framework; and records the ongoing dialogue the theory has offered to the field to continually challenge prevailing presumptions and presuppositions."

This paper considers the paradoxes in simultaneous control and loss of control and some of their practical implications. In addition it moves beyond the outstanding work done on complexity and crises in public relations to consider how complexity can inform interventions and strategies in other areas. It focuses these considerations through two New Zealand case studies: one on outsourcing and organisational identity; and the other on technology implementation. Finally it explores how to make a case for the implementation of complexity-influenced practice through a phased surrender of some traditional scientific management practices and considers implications for research methods.
2007-0322,Conversation in the Making: A Study of Self-Repair in Hebrew Talk-in-Interaction,Creating Communicative Opportunity Within and Between Many Languages,,,,Paper,Conversation in the Making: A Study of Self-Repair in Hebrew Talk-in-Interaction,Creating Communicative Opportunity Within and Between Many Languages,"This paper is intended as a contribution to a growing understanding of the interdependency of INTERACTION (here: same-turn self-repair, Schegloff, Jefferson & Sacks 1977) and GRAMMAR (here: syntax and morphology). The study is based on recorded data of 64 minutes of Israeli Hebrew discourse among a total of 51 speakers distributed across 23 different interactions, manifesting 251 tokens of self-repair in naturally-occurring everyday conversations. For some time it has been known that same-turn self-repair (hereafter: self-repair) is not produced randomly but is highly patterned, both phonetically and morpho-syntactically. Cross-linguistic variation in patterns of self-repair are particularly significant because previous studies suggest a relationship between the typological characteristics of individual languages and patterns of self-repair. With the exception of Fox, Maschler, and Uhmann 2006 which compares replacement and repetition phenomena in English, Hebrew, and German, Hebrew has been a language heretofore undescribed with repsect to self-repair. The present study seeks to remedy this. In particular, I explore the dependency of type of self-repair on the parts-of-speech of the elements involved. I show that function words are typically involved in repair phenomena of a different nature as compared with content words. However, as self-repair is a functionally highly complex activity (Egbert 2002), I take into account not only the part-of-speech employed, but also the fact that variability might be due to interactionally different activities participants engage in. In contributing to our understanding of how grammar and interaction shape one another, this study sheds light on the constitutive and emergent properties of communication."

Participants played against computer-simulated partners (avatars) with low/high manipulated credibility. Our central finding was that emotionally expressive and generally trusting individuals were more likely to cooperate on the first move but only under circumstances that provided limited to no environmental information that is relevant to cooperative decision making (Study 1). As soon as individuals were presented with relevant information about their partners emotional states, the decision making seemed to shift from what the inside to the outside influence (Study 2). We conclude that personality matters only to certain extend relative to much more influential environmental and transactional information. This experiment was also successful in demonstrating how individuals are likely to assume dyadic interaction and assign human qualities to computer agents and manipulated avatars."

Public relations and international business literatures offer evidence on effective organizational structure, strategies, and actions to manage conflicts or crises that originate in one country yet transferring and having consequences for the organizations headquarters or main host markets. This paper is a comprehensive review of pertinent literature that informs best practices, teaching, and avenues for future research in global public relations management."

How useful is it as a model for public relations? Is it a radical paradigm change or a more gradual shift of perspective? What aspects of public relations can gain the most from a complexity-based approach? How would complexity theory influence research methods? How could it change our expectations from public relations?

Animations are flying, movies are playing, music is screeching, text is blinking, and there are colors galore. The style has parallels to Geocities homepages or American teenagers' bedroom walls. Yet, what is fascinating about these pages is how they emerged. MySpace doesn't support users' modifications; it simply allows users to hack into the form code to alter the underlying HTML and CSS. As a result, a copy/paste culture has emerged as people help each other personalize their page. Taking codes from all over the web, modding them when possible, MySpace users have learned to remix code to construct a digital identity.??In this paper, we will discuss how the codes process serves as a form of structural and social remix. We will argue that copy/paste codes allow people to remix cultural artifacts to say something about themselves."
2007-0327,"Copyright, the Information Society, and Neo-Liberalism",terrogating Media Neo-Liberalisms,,,,Paper,"Copyright, the Information Society, and Neo-Liberalism",Interrogating Media Neo-Liberalisms,"This paper argues that one of the most significant manifestations of neo-liberalism in the realm of cultural production has been the use of the idea of the information society (and close relatives such as the knowledge economy) as a justification for the strengthening of copyright. While a number of writers have addressed this latter subject, and have attempted to theorise it in relation to ideas of the commons and public knowledge, there has been little successful effort to explain developments in copyright - including its global spread through institutions such as the World Trade Organisation - in relation to the historical development of capitalism, and to the rise of neo-liberalism. In an effort to correct this lacuna, the paper draws on David Harveys notion of accumulation by dispossession and on John Frows analysis of commodification, bridging political economy and cultural studies understandings of relations between culture and economy"
2007-0328,Corporate Appropriation of Participatory Culture,Limits to Creating Critical Content Online,,,,Paper,Corporate Appropriation of Participatory Culture,Limits to Creating Critical Content Online,"People who make media have collaborated with those who use media in the past. Journalism has its Letters to the Editor, TV uses opinion polls and SMS-formats, radio offer phone-in talk shows. Online, media participation can be seen as the defining characteristic of the Internet in terms of its hyperlinked, interactive and networked infrastructure and digital culture. The mass media system is gradually giving way to a more interactive, narrowcast or multicast media ecology, dominated by a fascinating blend of large multinational corporations and grassroots initiatives. This presentation will focus on the industrial side of this media equation, examining how public relations and advertising firms utilize the participatory potential of digital culture to control the corporate message. Case studies include weblog ghostwriting and viral marketing."

Applying the relational maintenance framework, a content analysis was conducted to examine how major corporations utilize blogs for building and maintaining their relationships with various publics. Thirty-one corporate blogs, which were identified from lists of Fortune 500 companies and Interbrand 100 global brands, were analyzed to determine characteristics of corporate blogs and what specific relational maintenance strategies are applied. The studys findings reveal that among six relational maintenance strategies, positivity, assurances, and sharing tasks were most frequently applied by corporate blogs. None of the blogs appear to use an access strategy. It was also found that corporate blogs in service or retail industries are more likely to use relational maintenance strategies than those in a manufacturing industry."
2007-0330,"Corporate Crisis, Media Tonality, and Corporate Performance: A Time-Series Analysis of Spill-Over Effects.",Korean American Communication Association State-of-the-Art Panel,,,,Paper,"Corporate Crisis, Media Tonality, and Corporate Performance: A Time-Series Analysis of Spill-Over Effects.",Korean American Communication Association State-of-the-Art Panel,"Recently, Hyundai-Kia Motors, one of the biggest corporations in Korea found itself in a troubling corporate scandal regarding two of its CEOs. They created a slush fund and used it as a political leverage to secure their private interests. The scandal generated an abundance of media coverage between March 2006 and late September 2006. Media experts and corporate management believed that the media coverage triggered and amplified the management crisis. Even non-experts seemed to believe that the negative media coverage during the corporate crisis caused irreparable damage to the performance of company and the Korean auto industry.
We investigated whether such media coverage during a crisis was damaging. Specifically, we examined how the negative media coverage about the triggering event affected the media tonality of the company. To what extent the media tonality of CEOs spilled to the media tonality of companies - i.e., the spill-over effect. We also investigated to what extent the effect from negative media tonality of CEOs and companies spilled over to the corporate performance.
In addition, we examined what kind of cross-national spill-over effect would be observed during the corporate crisis. Some media opinion leaders set a trend in reporting, present new issues and interpretations, and thus trigger chain reactions in the media system. Mathes and Pfetsch (1991) explained such a phenomenon as a spill-over effect in inter-media agenda-setting process. We investigated whether there was a spill-over effect of inter-media agenda-setting from Korean media to the media in the other countries where Hyundai-Kia Motors sell their products. Few studies tested such cross-national spill-over effects empirically.
We measured media presence and media tonality of CEOs and companies through a comprehensive content analysis of media in Korea, UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and USA between 1/1/2006 and 9/30/2006. The analytic time frame for the study were pre-scandal period (week 1-12), during-scandal period (week 13-26), and post-scandal period (week 27-39). We also retrieved corporate stock prices from the Korean stock market.
Our analysis showed some correlations between CEOs and companies media tonality. But, we found no clear impact on corporate performance from negative media tonality during and after the crisis periods. Our analysis also showed that Korean media acted as an opinion-leader in initiating the issue coverage and providing an interpretive frame of reference to other foreign media in Europe and USA. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the spill-over effects--its scope, impact, and strategic implications during a corporate crisis."
2007-0331,Corporate Discourse and the Performance of Sustainable Development,The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,,,,Paper,Corporate Discourse and the Performance of Sustainable Development,The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,"Using feminist discourse theory, we examine several cases where conflict the natural environment and human rights has led companies to adopt and adapt emerging discourses of sustainable development. Our approach foregrounds the constitutive and transforming effects of language. By (re)constructing firms' relationship to nature and society, corporate eco-talk, for instance, has opened up new understandings of corporate social responsibility and produced innovative practice including environmental reporting, stakeholder dialogue, and NGO-business partnerships. We do not suggest, however, that such changes in corporate language and practice necessarily signify unidirectional progress toward sustainable development. Rather, we argue that sustainability, like other values entailed by corporate social responsibility, is continually defined and (re)defined through political contests within and outside the firm. This is how such universal values are actually made ""real"" for the firm's members and become institutionalized in society. Accordingly, the ethical effects of story-telling, including our own, must be taken into account."
2007-0332,Corporate Giving and Getting: Perspectives From Healthcare,Creating Strategic Organizational Communication,,,,Paper,Corporate Giving and Getting: Perspectives From Healthcare,Creating Strategic Organizational Communication,"With the aim of contextualizing the process and strategic value of corporate giving, this study explores executive perceptions of corporate giving in the healthcare industry. Through in-depth interviews, executives explain how their companies are balancing the benefits of corporate giving with the costs of doing so. Executives do not perceive corporate giving as contributing to the bottom line, but do realize its ability to fulfill business objectives by building relationships with key stakeholders. We conclude that healthcare companies use corporate giving strategically to develop business-relevant relationships and partnerships, creating a cycle of opportunity within the industry. We elaborate the Cycle of Opportunity Model of Corporate Giving and contend this model as a contribution to scholarly and industry conceptions of corporate giving and its location in the wider discussion about corporate social responsibility."
2007-0333,"Corporate Governance, Corporate Social Responsibility and Communication",The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,,,,Paper,"Corporate Governance, Corporate Social Responsibility and Communication",The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,"Corporate social responsibility is primarily a corporate governance problem. Systemic organizational failures and negative social consequences are created by corporate governance structures and processes that preclude creativity and enable the exaggerated representation of some values and interests at the exclusion of others. Traditional governance models have counted on some combination of managerial stewardship, governmental regulation, and consumer choices to advance CSR. Each, however, has become less effective in providing guidance for a variety of well-documented reasons. In contrast, stakeholder governance models offer political and economic benefits. Still stakeholder collaboration remains fairly underdeveloped and often ineffective. Limited stakeholder inclusion, strategic management of stakeholders and/or co-optation of stakeholder involvement by managerial groups creates limits. But a bigger but more hidden problem has been the lack of serious attention to models of communication in collaborative decision making. Innovative communication processes based in conflict rather than consensus models can positively impact CSR."

The study found out that just a little more than half of these companies (59%) has a working Website. The use of the Web to project their identity is not as well used as it should be (neither the projection of identity elements nor the quality of their elaboration). These sites are principally focused on clients (91%), mass media (79%) and community (76%). In addition, the two-way communication is effective only in less than a third part of these companies (29%), which is surprising."

Therefore the press coverage regarding CSR issues of the nationwide German opinion-leader newspapers is analyzed via a content analysis over the period 1995-2005. Recording units of the 176 articles do not only include actors and issues, but also the relevant media frames. Interestingly, CSR is discussed quite comprehensively in the business and politics sections. However, it is a diffident subject in the analyzed German media  albeit having gained in importance. The journalistic debate is comparatively coined by problem consciousness, anxious to meet the requirements of the intricate issue. At this juncture it becomes evident that there is much potential for an active and effective organizational communications management, although too little availed so far."

Although Samsung wanted to express a full apology through the donation, a majority of Korean journalists interpreted Samsungs philanthropic donation as ingratiation and justification to minimize the negative outcomes such as tarnished reputation. The major practical implication of this study is that public relations practitioners who plan to conduct philanthropic activity as a crisis communication strategy should check how their important publics perceive the companys other responsibilities (economic, legal, and ethical responsibility) before conducting the philanthropic activity."

Within that historical view, we examine the nuances, strategies and discourses of the cluster of terms commonly associated with what we take as the parent term, corporate social responsibility. We also examine the socio political contexts which have given rise to these discourses. From there we extrapolate from cases and contexts to consider the probable and possible future of the CSR movement: the probable based on evidence to date; the possible as an aspirational view of what would be required for genuine movement towards a sustainable and responsible role for business in society."

This study attempts to identify the correlates of satisfying mentoring experiences. It focuses on a network of mentors who have been involved with a local nonprofit organization, which provides alternative activities and positive role models for at-risk adolescent females. The survey method is used to identify the factors which were correlated with mentoring perceptions. Subjects included volunteers who have been involved with the network over a 2-year period. Results suggest that mentoring satisfaction is related to various empathy dimensions. Mentors satisfaction is not significantly related to the time spent with their mentees. Female, married mentors with children are more likely to commit to long-term involvement. The results suggest that the mentoring process must be studied in the context of values and communication modalities in interpersonal relationships. Further studies should consider their influence on perceptions of satisfaction and the motivations for long-term mentoring relationships."

The research was conducted at a small (N=13) research based consultancy in the Netherlands. The paper uses the structural, relational and cognitive dimension of social capital. Our hypothesis is that the formal and informal network are related to each other through communication (email, face-to-face and telephone) networks. Moreover, we investigate which communities exist within the organization. Our underlying goal is to facilitate HR managers to improve social capital through these different dimensions and thereby improving organizational performance. To conclude, alternative research options are issued."

In Study 1, a survey of 170 young adults indicated little relationship between cosmetic surgery makeover program viewing and body satisfaction or perception of risk, but a small positive association with desire to undergo cosmetic surgical procedures. In Study 2, a survey of 271 young women tested three theoretical explanations for this association. Evidence in support of cultivation theory, social cognitive theory, and social comparison theory emerged, thus highlighting the need for a more integrated theoretical model of media effects."

Urban cosmopoles are locations that juxtapose difference, both shaping and reflecting the tense meetings of the local and the global. While looking at media consumption among urban diasporic people, this paper discusses the various and changing appropriations of local, national and transnational media. As consuming diasporic, mainstream and alternative media, urban diasporic subjects reveal their conditional engagement with local, national and global cultures. The analysis of media consumption and talk therefore can unravel the shifts in the meanings of the global as a political and cultural reference that informs and at the same time contests belonging in more than one imagined community."

Effects of Specialization in Web Agents, Web Sites and Computers on E-Commerce Trust",Personalization of Websites,"Suppose you went shopping online for wines and visited several sites, each recommending particular reds and whites. Which kind of site are you likely to trust morecostco.com or wine.com? The specialization implied by the latter suggests more expertise in the domain of wines. Does it mean you are more likely to purchase wines recommended by sites such as wine.com and virtualvinyards.com than those recommended by generalist sites such as costco.com and samsclub.com? Our study attempts to answer this question by experimentally investigating how specialization in media technology (specifically, web agent, web site, and computer) influences individuals perception and attitudes towards sources in online communication, particularly consumer trust and purchase behaviors in e-commerce. All subjects (N = 124) went to a specially constructed online site with a virtual shopping cart for a wine-purchasing task, as part of a 2 (specialist vs. generalist web agent) x 2 (specialist vs. generalist website) x 2 (specialist computer vs. generalist computer) between-subjects experiment. Results indicate significant main effects and interactions of the media specialization on trust and purchase decision time. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

The potential and applicability of attribution theory are by far not exhausted in order to understand how attributions arise and how they influence stakeholders perceptions of organizations in ongoing crises. A theoretical framework for explaining covariation-based causal inferences in attribution theory will be discussed and proposed for application in crisis communication research. On the basis of partially constructed crisis scenarios, basic assumptions of Kelleys covariation principle (1967, 1973) will be explained and suggested for future empirical tests. The resulting framework possibly can be considered as complementary to Situational Crisis Communication Theory (Coombs & Holladay 1996, 2004). Thus, it can be discussed for inclusion into the model, subject to the condition that forthcoming studies provide sufficient empirical evidence. Such an extension could help to deepen our understanding of how crisis responsibility attributions emerge and how crisis managers can refine their strategies of communication with stakeholders during organizational crisis."
2007-0344,Covering Crime in Washington DC: Local Television News Coverage of Crime and Its Effect on Emotional Response,Emotion,,,,Paper,Covering Crime in Washington DC: Local Television News Coverage of Crime and Its Effect on Emotional Response,Emotion,"This paper examines the nature of local television news coverage of crime and its effects on emotional response. Specifically, I present the results of a content analysis of two months of local television news coverage of crime from a network affiliate in the Washington DC metropolitan area. Consistent with what others have found regarding local television news, I find that most local news crime stories are episodic in nature and focus on violent crime, particularly murder. Moreover, there is a specific racial cast to this coverage  significant attention is given to black perpetrators while black victims are undercovered. Using an experiment that compared two types of crime stories taken from the content analysis to explore how coverage influences viewers emotional reactions, I find, contrary to my expectation, that a thematic story about violent crime generates greater and more varied emotional response than an episodic story dealing with a specific murder. When I vary the race of the perpetrator portrayed in the episodic story to try to examine the influence of the prevalence of visuals of black perpetrators in the crime coverage, I do not find differences in how participants in this study respond to the murder story based on the race of the perpetrator. I discuss the implications of my findings and suggest future directions for this research."

Possible implications of these findings are discussed."
2007-0346,"Coworker Backstabbing: Strategies, Motives, and Responses",Creating Organizational Resistance,,,,Paper,"Coworker Backstabbing: Strategies, Motives, and Responses",Creating Organizational Resistance,"Much research focuses on violence and sabotage aimed at companies, while scant attention is given to sabotage aimed at coworkers within organizations. Most sabotage is covert and intended to harm a colleague, and generally benefits the perpetrator. The purpose of this study is to research coworker backstabbing as a distinct construct in organizational communication. This study focuses on the research question: How is backstabbing used as a communication strategy within organizations? This is an exploratory, qualitative study using thematic inductive analysis. Demographics indicated this phenomenon cuts across gender, age, type of organization, field of work, and hierarchical position in the organization. Primary strategies used for backstabbing included dishonesty, blame or false accusation, discrediting another, and taking credit for anothers work. Motives for backstabbing included disregard of others for personal gain, self-image management, a personal reason, revenge, and jealousy. Communicative responses to backstabbing incidents included categories of interaction, action, and emotion."
2007-0347,Craft and Conservation: Features of a Danish Journalism Culture,Political Culture and Journalism Culture: Theoretical Approaches,,,,Paper,Craft and Conservation: Features of a Danish Journalism Culture,Political Culture and Journalism Culture: Theoretical Approaches,"The field theory of Pierre Bourdieu offers an analytical framework in which to theoretically conceptualise and empirically explore the concept of Journalism Culture. Denmark is used as a case study to discuss two significant aspects of this, the education and recruitment of journalists and the nature and structure of the journalistic labour market. First, field theory points towards the recruitment and education of journalists as a key indication of Journalism Culture. The Danish case study shows, how journalism as a craft is still the dominant educational model even thought the trade school monopoly was broken in 1999 when journalism was introduced as a university course in Denmark. The dominant craft model is visible in the curriculum influenced by the government and trade organisation, where 12 months of internship has been made obligatory as part of the masters degree in journalism at the university. Second, field theory points towards the structure of the journalistic labour market as another key indicator of Journalism Culture. The Danish case study shows, how a strong journalistic trade union has succeeded in keeping journalistic salaries high, in controlling the supply of journalists through influence on the educational model in both trade school and at the university, while successfully creating barriers for journalistic work places to hire people who do not have a journalistic education (for instance academics). Taken together, the existence of a singular dominant model of journalism education (journalism as a craft) and the strong influence of the trade organisation on the journalistic labour market, points towards a Danish journalism culture which is characterized by conservation of professional values and little competition or dynamic."

We evaluate craft culture, or fabriculture, around three major knots: 1) the spaces of production, especially as they are gendered; 2) the relationship between old and new technology, or how the digital and the handicraft are woven together; 3) how this popular cultural form poses new questions about activism.
We take into account the mainstream forms found in Martha Stewart Living as well as the more activist (or craftivist) versions such as Cast Off, Anarchist Knitting Circle, MicroRevolt, Anarchist Knitting Mob, Revolutionary Knitting Circle, and Craftivism. In addition, a whole range of cultural forms fall in between these poles, such as the virtual knitting circles and crafting blogs, as well as the association with (post)feminism in the pages of Bitch and Bust magazine.
As a resurgence of the private into the public sphere (materially and virtually), fabriculture reopens the politics of domesticity. These gendered spaces are also tied to questions of value regarding traditionally defined womens work. Finally, fabriculture poses new questions surrounding gender and technology. While cyberculture and digital culture seem inherently opposed to the archaic practices of weaving, spinning, and crafting, we argue that their trajectories are bound together. Ultimately, we seek to conceptualize craft as power (the ability or capacity to act), as a way of not only understanding fabriculture, but also the value of womens labor and current political possibilities."

It analyses data collected in interviews and focus groups with industry members, and explores the communication processes used by the dairy industry to manage its communication environment, at a time of intense debate about GM issues both within New Zealand and internationally. The findings suggest that the co-operatively owned dairy industry attempted to control its operating and regulatory environment, drawing on market and technical discourses in an attempt to maintain its identity as a successful global competitor. Although somewhat successful in influencing the New Zealand public policy environment, the industry communication campaigns were less successful in engaging interactively with industry members or international customers, despite a relatively high uptake of information communication technologies in New Zealand, and the potentially democratising opportunities that this provided."

It also considers the extent to which young journalists see themselves as prosumers, or people who are simultaneously creators and consumers of news, information, and expression. Analyzing the ways in which young people discuss the motivations that make journalism a meaningful pursuit for them, the research considers what young journalists say about high school journalism in relation to Ito et.al.s (2005) theory of online networked publics, and what the implications of their experiences are for theories of scholastic, emergent, and citizen journalism (Dickson, 2001; Gillmor, 2006; Matheson, 2004).

This paper examines the transformation of a traditional alternative news agency towards adapting a digital way of communicating and creating content. By focusing on Inter Press Service (IPS) and its daily online news service in Flanders (Belgium), the surplus value of the agency within the international news market and our Western democracy is being evaluated. Based on an extensive literature review and a quantitative online survey among Flemish journalists and editors, it is argued that IPS still represents a useful and necessary supplement to the mainstream news offer. The IPS output critically questions establishment and ultimately aspires to create a sense of commitment. However, the study also indicates that if the agency wishes to maintain its unique role of sensitizing the audience and bridging the information gap between North and South, a faster and more professional news service is vital."
2007-0352,Creating Dialogue in Communication in Marginalized Settings: A Subaltern Studies Approach,Public Sphere in Mediated Frameworks,,,,Paper,Creating Dialogue in Communication in Marginalized Settings: A Subaltern Studies Approach,Public Sphere in Mediated Frameworks,"This essay explores the potential of subaltern studies scholarship to open up new vistas of research in dialogue theory. Promising a robust way of thinking about dialogue, subaltern studies creates discursive openings for marginalized voices by questioning and displacing the locations of power within discursive spaces. An examination of dialogue literature reveals that traditional models of dialogue in communication do not adequately grapple with the complex issues of power and domination that perpetuate the dominant idea of communication. A theoretical engagement with subaltern studies suggests the political economic nature of dialogue, centralizes the issue of infrastructural capacity in the realm of dialogue and opens up avenues for exploring alternative forms of communication that exist outside the realm of the dominant discursive space. Finally, the subaltern studies project sensitizes the researcher to the position of power and privilege associated with academic knowledge and calls for a reflexive journey of solidarity between the researcher and subaltern community. Thus, with its potential to interrupt the modernist epistemic structures, subaltern studies becomes an entry point to explore the emancipatory potential of dialogue."

This paper introduces different ways of how players actively create new content based on computer games: Gamics (comics based on modified screenshots of computer games), machinima (films that are shot within the virtual reality of a game engine), and mods. A mod is a user-generated modification of a computer games that is distributed over the internet for free. Even though the creation of game content and especially the development of modifications has a long tradition among computer game players, it has hardly been researched from a communication science perspective. Results from a qualitative study on reasons for making mods are presented. The results indicate that, among others, being creative and translating individual ideas into game content is a strong motivation for users of computer games to develop mods."

The paper has two main goals. Firstly, to examine how the regulation of the Internet has emerged as an object of global governance in the context of the United Nations. Secondly, using a neo-Foucauldian governmentality perspective, to explore and explain how these UN-initiated regulatory activities have been driven and shaped by a cluster of concerns, principals and imageries about technological features of the Internet and its relationship to socio-political transformations. This exploration gives important insights into the contemporary shape of Internet regulation and the principals and knowledge bases that have given momentum to and shaped this emergent object of global governance. In particular, the paper shows how technological features of the Internet have come to function as models for the shape of its regulation."

Public relations appears to lack a central rationale for how and why their suite of practices contributes to organisational success and in what way. Other questions relate to the lack of attention to how the various types of activities and roles together contribute to organisational effectiveness. Several scholars are suggesting that legitimacy provides an overarching rationale that could link public relations practice across organisations, industries and countries (Boyd, 2000; Giaradelli, 2004; Massey, 2001; Metzler, 1995, 2001; van Ruler & Vercic, 2005; Vercic, van Ruler, Butschi, & Flodin, 2001). In this paper, I build on this call to consider legitimacy as a rationale for public relations by drawing on institutional theory as an interpretive framework for viewing organisation-public relationships and organisational effectiveness."

There is an increasing awareness that interventions, to be effective, must acknowledge the unique challenges to sexual risk reduction faced by individuals of different sexual orientations, genders and racial and ethnic backgrounds (Kirby et al., 2004; Williams, 2003). Person-level interventions are more specifically tailored; however, these interventions are expensive and only reach a small proportion of the at-risk population (DiClemente & Wingood, 2000). Electronic games, however, are able to sustain the interest of older adolescents and the game play experience is easily tailored and customized to the specific needs of individual players. In addition, there are several characteristics of video games that make them very powerful learning environments. . In a video game, a player assumes control of the primary character and directs their actions and experiences subsequent rewards and consequences. In this way, players receive immediate, direct, corrective reinforcement, which is arguably a stronger and more vivid reward than the types of vicarious rewards one might get from watching a television character. In addition, video game players are simultaneously exposed to modeling, reinforcement and rehearsal of behaviors (Anderson & Dill, 2000). This three-part combination of learning strategies, or variables, is more powerful than any method may be when used singly (Barton, 1981; Chambers & Ascione, 1987; Loftus & Loftus, 1983). This presentation will discuss the design and development of a safer sex video game intended to teach urban emerging adults the scripts and behavior skills necessary to engage in safe sex."

Despite the appeal of new media and technologies as a means to building bridges and enhancing public participation in society, there is increasing attention in public relations research to considering how integral interpersonal communication is to creating public relations. This essay provides theoretical frameworks through which further examination of this form of creating communication can be made."

Positioning teenagers as cultural producers, this paper details the way teenagers' digital productions help them strengthen social ties, build new social networks, and allow youth to transcend symbolic and geographic boundaries to explore both fantasy and physical worlds beyond their physical reach. The data in this paper is taken from interviews with and observations of students from a northern California school called the California Digital Arts High School (CDAH). This paper argues that while youth who attend this school live in a relatively dangerous neighborhood, their digital connections allow them to engage in processes of cultural production that strengthen existing social networks, in a way they can't always do in person, forge new social connections and help them build cultural capital that might otherwise be unattainable.

C.J. Pascoe is a sociologist who has researched teenagers in educational and social settings for 10 years. She is currently a Postdoctoral Scholar on the Digital Youth Project at the Institute for the Study of Social Change, School of Information, UC Berkeley. Her previous articles have focused on the construction of gender selves and the interactional establishment of gendered dominance in adolescence. Her forthcoming book, Dude, You're a Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School (UC Press, 2007), looks at how working class boys and girls in a northern California high school enforce, resist and negotiate discourses of masculinity and how those definitions relate to discourses of sexuality."

While many of the disaster victims have been accused publicly and privately of not preparing for disasters, and in effect, waiting for governmental handouts, we found many instances of people working in networks and community groups to improve the situation of their friends, neighbors, and faith networks. Further suggestions for community self-reliance and preparation are provided."

The article examines RISC Monitor in relation to Finnish press journalism practice and considers the views on journalism and the audience it reinforces. This international and widely used market research monitors social change by analysing peoples lifestyles, attitudes, and values. Here the focus is on the implications of using RISC Monitor for the idea(l)s of journalism as transmission of information and as a resource for public participation and active citizenship. The study is based on qualitative interviews with journalists. Discourse analysis is used as a theoretical and methodological frame of reference. The analysis points towards heterogeneous ways of applying RISC Monitor in newsrooms. The criteria for good journalism are (re)negotiated according to the wants and needs of target groups, and readers are perceived as consumers. However, emerging ideals and practices also aim at serving people as active citizens."

Psychological Processes Underlying the Choice of Avatar Features in Computer Games,Gaming 2.0: Researching the Active User,"A growing number of video and computer games enable users to create their own avatars. This study aims at identifying underlying processes that affect the choice of specific avatar features. Social Identity Theory (SIT) (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) suggests that users create an avatar that is similar to themselves to allow for processes of social identity such as social comparison. Opposed to that, preceding qualitative interviews showed that women choose avatars according to game requirements. Applying a 2 (gender) x 3 (game requirements predominantly male, female, neutral) quasi-experimental design, subjects were confronted with computer game descriptions that differed in their requirements concerning the avatars abilities. Subjects were then free to design an avatar to play with in the respective gaming situation. Data were analyzed focussing on the question whether subjects avatar design was guided by processes related to SIT or by the situational requirements expressed in the game descriptions."
2007-0362,Creation of a New Public Sphere: Internet Activism and Democratization of Korea,Korean American Communication Association State-of-the-Art Panel,,,,Paper,Creation of a New Public Sphere: Internet Activism and Democratization of Korea,Korean American Communication Association State-of-the-Art Panel,"Criticizing early Internet optimists hailing the liberal potential of new information technologies, many media scholars have pointed out negative attributes of the corporate-dominant Internet, which gave rise to many extant problems such as digital divide, fragmentation, and adaptivity to dominant political culture.
However, the emergence of a tide of Internet-based-activism requires a new account for progressive uses of the Internet. This research views the Internet as a contested terrain in which both progressive and conservative forces emerge and struggle for their own political goals. While dominant social groups strive to appropriate the virtual space to take commercial profits and penetrate its political hegemony, oppositional social groups struggle to redeploy new technologies for progressive social movements. This study focuses on the progressive uses of the Internet in relation to oppositional social movements.
We aim to examine how the Internet is used for social movements and how distinct Internet-based-activism stems from traditional social movements. Focusing on the 2002 SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement between the U.S. and Korea) Revision Movements in Korea, this research explores three main areas: First, it considers the historical and political background in which the Internet has been used for oppositional social movements in Korea. Second, it also discusses how the movement was motivated and developed online and offline. Third, it analyzes what are the main differences from traditional social movements.
This study employs multiple research methods including the grounded theory, historical approach, in-depth interviews, focus group interviews, and textual analysis. Based on integrated framework of social movement theories, this research finds that the role of the Internet was crucial in (1) constructing critical discourse, (2) forming collective identity, (3) creating a new agency, (4) organizing online and offline demonstrations, and (5) articulating counter-frames against mainstream culture and politics.
In the construction of counter-hegemonic discourses and actions, on the one hand, a new agency, so-called Netizens, collaborated with traditional social movement organizations. On the other hand, as shown in the debate between Netizens and Bum-Dae-We (Federation of civic movement organizations in Korea), this movement embodied a new form of political activism, which conceives decentralized, non-hierarchical, more participatory networks as an ideal of political actions, challenging the authority of traditional oppositional groups. This study implies that the Internet can constitute a new public sphere as the third sector against not only mainstream institutions but also hierarchical social movement agencies."
2007-0363,Credibility.com: Politically Motivated Bias in Online News Quality Ratings,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Credibility.com: Politically Motivated Bias in Online News Quality Ratings,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,"News recommender systems collect user-generated ratings of news stories in order to help future users decide whether to view the content. These recommendations have significant influence on peoples news consumption, yet little is known about their reliability. One concern is that ratings might be biased by raters political attitudes, which could significantly reduce recommendation trustworthiness. This paper argues that raters tend to reward news stories for including information with which they agree without penalizing the inclusion of other perspectives. The influence of opinion-relevant content on quality perceptions was tested using a web-administered experiment. The results confirm that the presence of opinion-reinforcing information is associated with higher user-assigned quality scores, but the presence of opinion-contrary information is not associated with lower scores. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for recommender system performance and the news market more broadly."
2007-0364,Crisis Communication and the Rhetorical Arena: A Multivocal Approach,Crisis and Risk Communication,,,,Extended Abstract,Crisis Communication and the Rhetorical Arena: A Multivocal Approach,Crisis and Risk Communication,"The aim of this paper is twofold. In the first part of the paper, we would like to give a critical presentation of two important research traditions within the new and emerging field of crisis communication: that is, 1) the rhetorical or text-oriented research tradition (Benoit 1995, Benoit 2004, Hearit 2006) and 2) the strategic or context-oriented research tradition (Sturges 1994, Coombs 1999, Coombs 2004, Coombs 2006). In the second part of the paper, we would like to present a new model for crisis communication labelled the rhetorical arena. This model differs from the two theories mentioned above in two important respects. First of all, the model is based on a multivocal approach: that is, it is both sender- and receiver-orientered. The concept of crisis communication does not only cover the communicative activities of the organisation in crisis, but includes the communication of all relevant stakeholders (including the media, political constituents, consumers and citizens). Thus, the rhetorical arena of crisis communication is a place where many corporate and noncorporate voices meet, compete and negotiate. Secondly, the model is based on a conception of crisis communication as mediated - that is, we analyse crisis communication introducing four parameters in order to reach more detailled findings. The four parameters are: 1) context (crisis type, crisis situation, social actors and structures), 2) media (type of media), 3) text genre (like the press release), and 4) text (like the preformulation of a news article in the press release, cf. Jacobs 1999)."
2007-0365,Crisis Communication in a New World: Reaching Multicultural Publics through Old and New Media,Crisis and Risk Communication,,,,Paper,Crisis Communication in a New World: Reaching Multicultural Publics through Old and New Media,Crisis and Risk Communication,"Crisis communication has recently gotten a lot of attention in media due to several large organizational crises, such as Enron, and is also an expanding research field. A weakness of the traditional research field is the lack of theoretical development and the isolated sender focus based in a mass communication paradigm. In this paper we challenge this paradigm, by focusing on the contemporary cultural and ethnic diversity in society from an audience-oriented media perspective. In the paper we review earlier research on multicultural crisis communication and propose a social constructionist perspective. The discussion is based on secondary data on multicultural media use in Sweden and an Internet analysis focusing dialogue and community building. All together, the review and secondary data show the need of directing crisis communication not only through traditional mass media but also through micro- and new media. This is not only because of the simple reach of these channels, but also because of the increase in quality and dialogue potential in these great good places."

The study suggests several areas of theoretical linkages for further exploration and provides implications for practitioners negotiating a crisis."
2007-0367,Critical Theory Revisited: Herbert Marcuses Analysis of Advanced Industrial Society and the Study of Media Audiences,"Discourse, Power, and Society",,,,Paper,Critical Theory Revisited: Herbert Marcuses Analysis of Advanced Industrial Society and the Study of Media Audiences,"Discourse, Power, and Society","This paper argues that in its relative inattention paid to Herbert Marcuses work media and communication theory has overlooked a key conceptual resource in the study of contemporary mass communication and consumption, as central themes of Marcuses work - the relationship between self, nature and society in Eros and Civilisation (1956) and the absence of the possibility of qualitative change in industrial societies in One-Dimensional Man (1964) - provide fundamental insights into the self and its symbolic context in a modern, mass-mediated world and thus constitute an important framework for the study of contemporary media audiences. The paper therefore suggests that Marcuse remains a key point of reference as we move from documenting forms of mass communication to evaluating their purpose and social and cultural consequences, linking the micro frames of (qualitative) audience research with the macro concerns of social and cultural theory."

2007-0369,Cross-Lagged Analysis of Intermedia Agenda-Setting: An Interplay between Television News and Internet Portals in South Korea.,Korean American Communication Association State-of-the-Art Panel,,,,Paper,Cross-Lagged Analysis of Intermedia Agenda-Setting: An Interplay between Television News and Internet Portals in South Korea.,Korean American Communication Association State-of-the-Art Panel,"The Internet may have paved a new way to the research on public opinion and media effects. Netizens not only receive news information from the Internet but also use the same medium to share, exchange, and dispute each others political views. This interactivity allows the Internet to function as a public forum, where important issues are introduced and discussed, so that the opinion of the majority finally emerges. Important in this process of forming public opinion is the question of which issues are prominent on the Internet. As agenda-setting hypothesizes, prominent issues in the media may set the agenda not only for private discussions but also for policy debates among legislators.
This study raises a question, how is the Internet agenda set? Specifically, we look at the influence of television news on news selections of Internet portals in Korea. This process, commonly referred to as intermedia agenda-setting, explains the influence of prestige media on the news coverage of other news outlets.
Data for this study came from an extensive content analysis of two primetime news programs (KBS and MBC) and two major Internet portals (Daum and Naver) in Korea. Internet portals, which function as the entrance point to the sea of online information, play a major role as an online source of news information.
Looking at the correspondence between the prominent issues in television and those in Internet portals, this study looks at the extent to which television news may shape the agenda of Internet portals. Also examined is the question of whether the intermedia influences are reciprocal. Whereas television news may influence the Internet agenda, it is also likely that Internet portals may, to certain extent, influence the agenda of television news. That is, an issue becomes controversial on the Internet first; and then later offline media may pick up the issue and report it intensively in their primetime newscasts.
A series of cross-lagged correlation analyses revealed that television news might influence the process of issue selection in Internet Portals. Internet portals, however, did not show such a significant influence on the agenda of television news. The estimated influences from Internet portals to television news were all smaller than the baseline correlations, indicating that these influences were likely spurious and produced simply by the cross-sectional and time lagged associations. The implications of the findings are discussed in detail."

C-SPAN is privately owned, provided by the cable and telecommunications industry as a public service to US citizens. This paper examines the material raison d'être behind C-SPAN, taking the reader beyond the aforementioned ideological explanation and revealing the political economic reality of the network. While undoubtedly a public service, C-SPAN also provides the industry political and economic opportunities for material accumulation through: 1) its use as an effective political lever when lobbying Congress on industry related legislation, and 2) its ability to offer a unique venue to market industry services and products. Due to the mercurial nature of the free market, private ownership of public access to politics will be shown to be problematic."
2007-0372,CSR and the Power of Communication: A Postmodern Perspective,The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,,,,Paper,CSR and the Power of Communication: A Postmodern Perspective,The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,"The ways organizations talk about themselves and their social and environmental engagement are not neutral undertakings, but constitutive activities that contributethrough the articulation of ideals, values, and horizonsto the continuous enactment of organizational reality. Acknowledging that language and reality are closely intertwined, we may need to talk about corporate social responsi¬bility in ways that invite corporations to become more actively involved in articulating ideals, visions and practices for the future. Although we should continue to be critical of what organizations say or do with respect to social responsibility and sustainability, we should simul¬taneously allow them to experiment with the ways they communicate about these issues. The postmodern perspective is introduced to stimulate a sensitivity to the language we use when discussing the contribution of business to social betterment, and, most of all, to demonstrate the limitations of (at least some) grand narratives of modernity when discussing the prospects for corporations to be involved in social responsibility programs."

Based on these data, the paper addresses two key concepts  corporatism and communitarianism  and links these to the present and future of CSR in Singapore. In doing so, it analyzes the nexus between two government programs  Singapore 21 and Reinventing Singapore  and CSR in Singapore to offer an overview of relevant stakeholders who might be the future drivers of CSR in this prosperous city-state."
2007-0374,Cultivating a Journalistic Ethos? Equilibrium in British Journalism Education,Journalism Educators and Their Students: Missions and Values,,,,Paper,Cultivating a Journalistic Ethos? Equilibrium in British Journalism Education,Journalism Educators and Their Students: Missions and Values,"Debates centering on future directions of journalism education have gained prominence since Lee Bollingers attempt to transform the curriculum at Columbia Universitys Journalism School in 2003. The creation of an amenable balance between the teaching of journalism as a practice or craft and the teaching of journalism studies as a reflective, historically situated and theoretically orientated academic subject, seems to be one that is difficult to achieve. The most controversial aspects of the debate are orientated around the issues of providing students with the necessary practical grounding in journalism, whilst at the same time not placing pressure on what might be termed the journalistic ethos of objectivity and professionalism. Yet agreement about just what journalistic ethos might be seem difficult to achieve. This is all the more pertinent when asking questions about how we might cultivate such an ethos in our journalism degrees. This complexity is compounded by concerns about increasing commercial pressure on journalism education and the sorts of journalism graduates and post graduates this might produce. Though there is much critical and reflective literature on these debates within journalism education, much of this literature fails to deal empirically with these issues and interrogate journalists and journalism educators. This paper therefore outlines the initial findings of a qualitative research project undertaken in the UK which seeks to explore just what journalism education is and more importantly, what it should be, from the perspective of those at the sharp end of journalism: journalists within the industry and journalism educators. Is there such a thing as a journalistic ethos that we can cultivate in our students; is there a place for a critical journalism pedagogy that can be accommodated by journalism schools, by industry and (more pertinently) by society? The paper argues that by exploring the perspectives of those who work in journalism and those who teach journalism, some movement towards a better understanding of a journalistic ethos and how to cultivate that ethos might be gained."

A national survey of representative adults was conducted (N = 346) in order to test four hypotheses: (1) greater levels of television exposure predict greater levels of consumer materialism; (2) greater levels of television commercial enjoyment predict greater levels of consumer materialism; (3) parasocial symbolic interaction mediates the relationship between television exposure and consumer materialism; and (4) parasocial symbolic interaction mediates the relationship between television commercial enjoyment and consumer materialism. Multiple regression techniques were used to test all hypotheses. All hypotheses were confirmed."

Studies 1 and 2 found that American participants, compared to Korean, were more positive about the gratitude statement-included message and considered the advertiser of the gratitude statement-included message as more credible. Study 3 found that a greater number of both Korean and American participants included a gratitude statement in their own advertising message when they saw one in an example message than when they did not see one. When gratitude statement use was compared with apology use, however, it was found that American participants considered the gratitude statement, rather than apology, to be more credible, normal to use, and more effective for other people and also had a stronger intention to use a gratitude statement in their own advertising message. Additionally, a greater number of American participants actually included a gratitude statement, rather than an apology, in their own message when they saw a gratitude statement example or an apology example, whereas a greater number of Korean participants included an apology, rather than a gratitude statement, in their own messages."

There were three objectives for this investigation: (a) to determine whether emotional reactions of local-employee groups toward the behaviors of Japanese expatriates are likely to vary across the 5 cultural groups (i.e., even among Asians who have been indicated as collectivists); (b) to determine whether Japanese expatriates' emotional reactions toward the behaviors of local employees are likely to vary across the 5 Japanese groups (i.e., even among those working in Asian countries that have been reported as collectivistic); and, (c) to determine the degrees and types of emotional difficulties that local employees and Japanese expatriates had with regard to each other. Data analyses reveale that the local employees reactions toward the Japanese expatriates varied in 34 out of 44 items, and that the Japanese expatriates reactions toward the local employees also varied in 22 out of 43 items. Furthermore, the degrees and types of emotional reactions among the local employees and among the Japanese expatriates are described."

Specifically, we asked, what are Chinese Malaysians cultural ideals that are revealed via the speech act of complaint-making? Our findings were based on the communitys discussion about thou soo and aih auanthe speech acts that the community members considered meaningful in expressing dissatisfaction. Communication focused on dissatisfaction is a rich resource for understanding a communitys cultural values and ideals, since the person complaining is indicating that some shared value or ideal has not been met. Although the findings of this study do not provide a comprehensive list of the communitys cultural ideals, we believe we have provided important insights into a community that has not received much attention in research. In short, the Chinese Malaysians discourse and performance of complaint-making revealed 4 cultural ideals: (a) to be responsible, (b) to be protective, (c) to be dependable, and (d) to be rational. In the discussion, we reflect on how these expressed ideals fit with past research on East Asians in general and point out the danger of large scale generalizations."

In doing so, it traces the development of the current forms of Islamophobia to the origins of todays terrorism discourse when it emerged in the 1980s foreign policy. It argues that popular media in have contributed to this phobia by providing an interpretive framework in which the hegemonic discourse of the Middle East in the Western popular and political imagination is intelligible. I explain this phobia in terms of the concept of differentialist racism. Current politico-popular imaginary entails a wholesale conflation of Islam, Arabness, culture, politics, and history. I argue that the declaration and embracement of cultural difference and Otherness are attempts to avoid engaging the political dimension of foreign policy. I argue that the Otherness of Islam and Muslims is a projection of an inherent antagonism at the heart of the international community, an impossible society."

The Turkish community in Belgium has access to a variety of old and new media outlets in their native and host language, allowing them to learn about events and issues through both Western and non-Western lenses. By means of a quantitative survey among 400 respondents of Turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 60, home and host use of old (television, newspapers) and new media (Internet) was analyzed in relation to culture-specific features such as ethnic cultural position, religion, and command of language, alongside with socio-demographic features such as age, gender, education, years of residence and socio-economic status. Our investigation found religion and ethnic cultural position to be the strongest cultural determinants for home language news media use and command of the language as well as religion for host language news media use. These findings nuance earlier findings with Turkish youngsters in the Netherlands and Flanders (12-19), whose media use was predominantly related to socio-demographics."

A sample of 108 videos from current music countdowns were analyzed for thematic content and Afrocentric features of the characters. The results of this study found that materialism and misogyny are more common themes in videos than violence or sex. Also, women are more likely than men to perpetuate misogyny in rap music videos. Finally, Black women in the videos are more likely to have Eurocentric features than men in the videos. These findings can have important implications for effects research on rap music."

The study was designed to provide information about 1) the prevalence of this phenomenon, and 2) the profile of cyber bullies and victims.
A total of 636 primary school children and 1416 secondary school students participated in the survey. The results show that cyber bullying among youngsters is not a marginal problem (anymore). When asked directly whether they have ever been actively or passively involved in bullying via the Internet or mobile phone, one in ten youngsters answer that they have been a victim, almost two in ten say they have been perpetrators, and about three in ten respond they have been bystanders. Youngsters who, in their own perception, have bullied someone via the Internet or mobile phone spend more time on the Internet, have parents who are less involved with their use of the Internet, are more often also victims and bystanders of bullying via the Internet or mobile phone, are more often perpetrators of traditional acts of bullying, and do so anonymously in seven out of ten cases. Youngsters who feel like they have been bullied through the Internet or by mobile phone are more dependent upon the Internet (they find life without the Internet boring, they may disregard their homework to go online, they make many friends over the Internet), have fewer friends and feel less popular, are more often also a bystander and perpetrator of Internet and mobile phone bullying, are less often the perpetrator and more often the victim of traditional acts of bullying. They have told someone about the Internet or mobile phone bullying in less than half the cases."

The crisis sparked by Muhammad cartoons that swept the globe in early 2006 is just one of many recent examples testifying to the internationally conflictual potential of visuals. Language barriers still set limits to global communication, yet visuals transgress those barriers and evoke different responses in different cultural contexts. In our contemporary world we need to understand the connotations and the power of visuals, in order to be able to grasp the different meanings attributed to the same visuals, depending on the cultural context in which they are perceived. This understanding is a precondition for developing non-violent communication strategies to cope with cultural conflict instigated by visuals. In this paper the authors compare three cases of contemporary cartoon conflict with respect to the cartoons visual content, their production and reception contexts. The compared cases are: the cartoon conflict of late 2005/early 2006, sparked by the publication of 12 cartoons in a Danish newspaper depicting Muslim prophet Muhammad; the follow-up event of a cartoon competition initiated by the Iranian government, depicting and ridiculing the Shoah (Holocaust); and thirdly, also following the Muhammad cartoon publication, cartoons published in Bulgaria, depicting Libyan leader Colonel Khadafi in the context of a trial of Bulgarian nurses, accused of deliberately infecting Libyan children with HIV. A combination of qualitative methods is used in the exploratory research design: Systematic comparison on the one hand, iconology as method of visual content analysis on the other hand, following the tradition of Aby Warburg and Erwin Panofsky, but adapting this method originally developed by art historians to the special properties of visual mass media."

Human behaviors are often categorized in studies on intercultural communication based on observations of values, beliefs, norms, worldviews, language, nation, race, ethnicity, gender, and how these variables influence relationships among different cultures. Communication practices of interethnic Africans living in the United States provide rich data to examine the intercultural relationships among these diverse groups of people. This study investigates the meanings interethnic Africans attribute to their differences. The research question guiding this inquiry was, do individuals use themes to make sense of differences with other Africans, and if so, what are those themes? This research sought to illuminate Africans' own interpretations of differences they recognized in their relationships."

It also looks into power interplay and struggles within journalistic field in China. Two case studies of Zuoyun Mine Disaster Reporting and Propaganda Fights over Sangmei Typhoon Reports in 2006 contribute to the understanding. Empirical materials mainly depend on 6-month participant observation in 2 newsrooms and in-depth interviews with 60 journalists in 2006. It is argued that the tightness of control over media diversifies due to the regional distances of media to government and administrative levels of media and government. The administrative control over media is single way according to the nature of press system. Local government and media to a certain degree shares benefits besides the struggles over discourse right. Because of the nature of press system, local government has little power to control out-of-town or higher-level media. The lacuna leaves spaces for power struggles over media discourse. The paper argues that decentralisation in broader social contexts leads to decentralisation in the government-media relation. Local government tries to use media to protect local interests, while higher-level government utilises media to control lower-level government. Media becomes a mean of political struggles used by governments and politicians at different administrative levels."

This panel attempts to make a contribution to this discussion by examining some of the public and professional beliefs about interviewing and detecting deception within an interview, and to bring law enforcement and scholars together with the public in an attempt to understand communication within the law enforcement interview context. This panel presents 4 research projects that examine issues involved in rapport, body movements, eye contact, and specific verbal responses to particular statements that either the public, law enforcement, or both believe to be true, but for which the research evidence is either non existent or equivocal. These ideas were tested within a research paradigm that attempted to mirror as closely as possible situations encountered in real world criminal and counter-terrorism contexts. The first research project examines rapport and whether rapport can be built in a narrow time window. The next project tests assumptions regarding body position and deception. The third project tests whether eye contact is indeed an indicator of truthfulness or deception. Finally, the fourth project investigates assumptions regarding differences in response time to interrogator questions between truthtellers and liars. The respondents will focus on the theoretical and practical implications of these results, and how events that bring together scholars and law enforcement provide the window needed to expand the discussion to a better informed public to enable the public to better partners in their own security."

A questionnaire was developed to assess how employees perceive this type of communication as well as the subsequent effects. Results revealed three types of decision downloaders. Robust downloaders communicated to employees by discussing how and why the decision was made, how the decision fit into the organizational mission and vision, and how the decision could impact the organization as well as employees. In addition, they formally announced the decision and provided detail on implementation. Restricted downloaders discussed some of these issues, while remedial downloaders provided little or no information on these matters. Results also revealed that robust downloaders generated greater employee satisfaction, commitment to the organization, and identification with organizational values. The paper concludes with applications on how leaders can become robust decision downloaders."

The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to propose a theoretical foundation on the basis of which systematic and comparative research of journalism cultures is feasible and meaningful. By using a deductive and etic approach the concept of journalism culture is deconstructed in terms of its constituents and principal dimensions. Upon a review of the relevant literature the article proposes a conceptualization of journalism culture that consists of 3 essential constituents (Institutional Roles, Epistemologies and Ethical Ideologies), further divided into 7 principal dimensions: Interventionism, Power Distance, Market Orientation, Objectivism, Empiricism, Relativism, and Idealism."

First, the concept of proselytism as a communicative construct is explicated. Proselytism is an intentional asymmetric communication process during which a source presents a persuasive message in favor of the adoption of or change in religious ideology. Second, empirical data support the hypothesis that religious beliefs have 4 dimensions: descriptive, evaluative, prescriptive, and conviction strength. Lastly, the hypothesis that descriptive beliefs moderate the relation between manipulated proselytism and perceived proselytism is supported. Implications of including the moderating effect of perceptual filters on the use of manipulations in future and similar experiments is discussed."

The author analyzed the structural design of the consultation portal and the entire content of a discussion thread with 508 messages over a four-month period in 2005. Findings suggest that while the forum reflects many criteria for democratic deliberation, the lack of government participation and a sustained debate raise the question over the quality and effectiveness of this online medium and its political implication."

Global Civil Society and the Campaign for Communication Rights in the Information Society, TOP THREE PAPER",Civil Society in the Nation and Beyond,"The institutions for the realization of democracy are national in scope, but communications industries and information flows have become increasingly transnational. In this paper we consider the implications of promoting the ideas of transnational civil society and multi-stakeholder governance as default solutions to the problem of democratizing international institutions. Specifically, we critically examine the case of the Campaign for Communication Rights in the Information Society (the CRIS Campaign) during the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). We find the CRIS Campaigns struggle to shape global norms by mobilizing civil society actors, instructive on several levels. First, it reflects a long-term attempt to formulate and apply an overarching frame that puts the social role of communication at the center of policy development. Our analysis suggests that this effort was not that successful -- but the attempt nevertheless holds important lessons for communication scholars interested in the relationship between communication studies and public policy. Second, it provides insights on theories of transnational advocacy networks (TANs) and how those relate to the specific domain of communication policy. The case study also tests theories about the relationship between TANs and international organizations, revealing the interdependence of the needs of international institutions for legitimacy and participation and the needs and incentives of advocacy groups. Last but not least, the results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of multi-stakeholder governance, and raise important questions about institutional changes at the international level motivated by this default solution."

It is done within a framework of institutional competitiveness on hybrid markets, regarding media management as a constructive force at the crossroad of business and politics. From the 1920s until the 1980s, radio and television in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden was organized as state monopolies (PSBs). Taking their cue from the British BBC, the Scandinavian broadcasting corporations hailed public service ideals financed by license fees paid practically by every household within their signal reach. Neo-liberal deregulation, however, put the established public service businesses under political pressure. Depending on the way these challenges are managed, local players in global games may be prone to down market competition from commercial multinationals, or improve national diversity and PSB-license to operate."

Using media frame and deliberation theory literatures, this analysis examined 309 news stories about adoption that appeared on major broadcast networks between 2001 and 2005. A majority of stories were on fraud, crime, and legal disputes, which were more likely to use conflict, responsibility, and human interest frames. Diversity of news sources and inclusion of adoption participants motives and feelings varied with the adoption activity covered. Most stories mentioned some type of context factors, and nearly two-thirds of the negative news stories contained at least one positive depiction of adoption."

The paper is part of a large-scale project that examines the complex ways in which a sense of a collective European identity is being constructed in contemporary European visual discourse. I consider how Europe is reimagining and re-presenting itself in the wake of European integration and overall processes of globalization. In the multilingual context of Europe, visual discourse may function as a cross-culturally strategic form of communication, thanks to its perceptual availability and communicative power. Through a social semiotic analysis, I examine how public communication materials frame these cities as quintessentially European in order to show the European dimension required by the European Capital of Culture scheme as a key criteria for success. In particular, then, I discuss and problematize the ways in which cultural diversity and shared identity (i.e. the key principles of such European dimension found in official discourses about European integration) are discursively handled in these texts. In doing this, I identify a number of semiotic resources used towards this - potentially exclusive and certainly problematic - visual construction of European identity, specifically by dividing these visual resources into 2 overarching analytical categories: visual content and design effects. The data collection for this project was completed at the end of summer 2006 and the social semiotic analysis of visual texts is well under way, with the plan to complete it by the end of this year. The rest of the paper, including conceptual/methodological framework, background information and discussion of relevant cases, has been completed."

Few studies have conducted content analyses that effectively measure stereotypes in advertising other than using nominal level data. Accordingly, this study was designed to develop a new Stereotype Index, measuring at the ordinal level the extent to which an advertisement uses stereotypical images. The index was developed based upon a probability sample of prime-time U.S. television commercials during a sweeps month (November 4-December 1, 2004). The final sample included 845 advertisements and 1,062 central figures. Each advertisement received positive points for the use of stereotypes and negative points for the use of reverse- stereotypes in its content based on the Stereotype Index. The mean of each variable could subsequently be compared directly using parametric statistics rather than traditional chi-square analysis. Differences between nominal (categorical) and ordinal level data were examined. The new Stereotype Index enables researchers to make precise statistical comparisons among studies cross-culturally and longitudinally, something not possible before. Since science often is advanced by detecting and reporting changes in variables, not just static scores, this is an important contribution of the new Stereotype Index."

Half the adults within each age group were fans of the second program, thus were familiar with the characters, typical story lines, and production style. Comprehension was measured after each program, including memory for characters emotions and relationships, recognition and recall and chronology of main events, and ability to make inferences about the content. The results indicated significant age differences in comprehension. Age differences were smaller for socioemotional content and for relatively easy tasks, larger for chronological sequencing and inference measures. Age differences on most comprehension variables (but not inference-making) were smaller among fans viewing familiar content."
2007-0405,Development of a Continuous Measure of Exposure to a Television Drama to Help Prevent AIDS in South Africa,Focusing on Exposure as a Central Construct in Health Campaigns Research: Interventions in Africa,,,,Paper,Development of a Continuous Measure of Exposure to a Television Drama to Help Prevent AIDS in South Africa,Focusing on Exposure as a Central Construct in Health Campaigns Research: Interventions in Africa,"Evaluation of the effects of an entertainment-education program such as a television drama on the audience is difficult when the measure of exposure is based on a simple yes/no question in a survey with no possible measure of reliability and questionable validity due to acquiescence response set. For the evaluation of the national TV drama, Tsha Tsha, in South Africa, a continuous measure of recall was developed that was independent of the hypothesized social outcomes of the drama and which allowed for a dose response to be examined, one of the extra criteria for a causal attribution. To avoid acquiescence response, respondents were asked to look at photos of the four main characters from the drama and unaided give their correct names. They were also given a test of knowledge about features of the drama that were unrelated to the health issue of HIV/AIDS or the expected behavioral outcomes. Then they were given a list of the dominant event featured in each episode and asked if they remembered seeing that particular episode. The reliability of the scale comprised of these three measures was 0.93 (alpha), and when standardized ranged from 40.5 to 68.0 with a mean set at 50.0 (T-Score). Because the final measure was continuous, it was possible to determine if a dose response to the drama was operating versus a threshold effect (some minimal level of recall before any effect is possible). Ordinary least squares could also be used to obtain a residual term to test for endogeneity and reciprocal causality in a structural equation model with binary outcome variables, such as condom use and faithfulness to one sexual partner."

The project was carried out in various schools in Spain that are members of the Learning Communities project. This study analyses the interactions of children with members of the community who participate in the school in different spaces in which reading and literacy activities take place: in the classroom, in the library, in computer rooms, in family learning spaces, and at home. The objective here is to describe the nature of these interactions as well as their impact on childrens learning processes. The aim of this paper is to present the process of dialogic reading in educational practices. In order to do so the concept of dialogic reading and some basic theoretical elements will be introduced initially, and Vygotsky, Bakhtin, Mead, Habermas, Freire and other authors will be quoted. After briefly describing the methodology of the study, some of the findings which have been identified for discussion will be presented. These findings are connected to the improvement of literacy development in students who have been traditionally excluded from mainstream classrooms (children often labelled as unmotivated or less able to learn due to their families cultural background)."

The following paper discusses the negotiation that diasporic subjects engage upon and their relationship with the tourism industry. In doing so, one must enact multiple subject positions that transcend the simple notions of insiders and outsiders in an ideologically-driven tourism industry. By focusing on how Otherness is constructed and commodified by official texts of tourism, the current discursive boundaries of Communication are complicated and critiqued.

To this end, the paper is organized as follows. First, I describe how postcards and Cd Roms function. Second, I describe how ideological criticism allows for a continuation of previous research on souvenirs and their performative possibilities. Finally, I reflect upon my pilgrimage to my original home in Ecuador in order to deconstruct official texts of tourism and speak back to the dominant ideologies through unofficial texts. As scholars of Communication, we should engage in these conversations as we all search for, and maintain, our own notions of home."

This paper intends to map the developments around the diaspora, multiculturalism, transnational media and to interrogate the connections made between these three areas. The chapter begins with the evolution and adaptation of the term diaspora from its classical definition to the contemporary conceptualisation that includes recent migrant communities. After that, an overview of the multicultural debates in the UK is provided. This is then followed by an exploration of the growth of the concept of transnationalism and transnational media. In mapping these categories of diaspora, multiculturalism, and transnationalism, the paper proposes intersections of these three areas in understanding the growth and implications of transnational media in the diverse, global arena of the 21st century. The article uses Zee television as a case study, to illustrate the prevalence of the national framework and the key role-played by the nation-state, in the ambitions of a transnational media corporation."

Journalism Students and News Media Roles and Ethics,Journalism Educators and Their Students: Missions and Values,,,,Paper,Did the Educators Make a Difference? Journalism Students and News Media Roles and Ethics,Journalism Educators and Their Students: Missions and Values,"Journalism educators hope that their work is integral in the formation of new generations of watchdog journalists. Key ideals are that, when influencing journalism students, educators should stimulate public service motivations and foster the development of a confident maturity in ethical outlook. But the extent to which journalism education succeeds in such aims is rarely researched. This study of British graduate students in 12 journalism programmes at six universities assesses whether their views on the roles of the news media within society, and on the ethics of journalistic practices, changed during this education. Survey data from 291 students sampled as or soon after they arrived on these programmes were compared with data from 208 students sampled shortly before the programmes were completed. Compared to the arrival sample, the completion sample exhibited a statistically significant higher level of approval for the news media to be a sceptical adversary of public officials. But the completion sample placed less importance than the arrival sample did on the news media addressing the widest possible audience. Students in the completion sample were more likely than those in the arrival sample to approve of journalists using confidential business or government documents without authorisation, and tended to be less likely to approve of journalists disclosing rape victims names. Our findings are discussed in the contexts of British journalistic culture; the changing media ecology; possible generational differences in outlook between these students and experienced journalists; and findings from surveys of journalism students in other countries."
2007-0414,Difference in the Media: Prosocial Television and the Politics of Representation,Representing the Other in Contemporary Cultural Discourses,,,,Paper,Difference in the Media: Prosocial Television and the Politics of Representation,Representing the Other in Contemporary Cultural Discourses,"This essay interrogates mediated, and scholarly writing about, racial representation by theoretically incorporating the discourse of difference  as suggested by postcolonial and cultural studies scholars  into existent approaches to racial imagery. While existing literature recognizes problematic and discriminatory mediated racial imagery, few authors focus on deconstructing the relational hierarchies embedded in racial practices. This essay examines the pro-social model, pointing to its theoretical and empirical failure, as it continues to reproduce the inherited colonial discourse of difference. The politics of representation is offered as an alternative avenue for change, even while recognizing its long-term difficulty and challenges."

This research furthers that work to explore if the causes are found at the earliest stages of visual processing (bottom-up attention) or after further processing (top-down attention.) The author concludes that there is a difference based solely on the medium itself on both the early stages of information processing in the brain (visual perception) as well as later stages (related to cognitive load).

Research in relational maintenance behaviors indicated that relationship maintenance styles tend to vary depending on relationship stages (e.g., escalating or deteriorating) and types (e.g., dating, marital, engaged, or coworker). Although previous studies have shown that partners relationship maintenance behaviors influence self-reported relationship quality, no study has investigated the variability in relational maintenance behaviors during different parenting phases. Participants in the present study were 82 active parents and 56 empty nesters. To determine the associations of ones parenting phase with relationship maintenance behaviors, related hypotheses were posited. Results indicated that active parents reported engaging in maintenance behaviors more often than empty nesters, although no significant differences in relational satisfaction emerged, contradicting the prediction. It was also apparent that relationship maintenance strategies were well predictive of ones relationship satisfaction."

Data from a national survey indicate that level of Internet adoption and use is positively associated with knowledge and preventive measures. Date also reveal that the level of Internet use is a stronger predictor of knowledge and preventive measures than early adoption of the Internet. Research implications for public policy, communication research, and education are discussed."
2007-0418,Digital Inequalities: Not Just a Passing Phenomenon,Digital Inequality,,,,Paper,Digital Inequalities: Not Just a Passing Phenomenon,Digital Inequality,"The literature on status and Internet use demonstrates that status-high and status-low persons differ significantly in their Internet access and digital competences. In addition to looking at these differences we also explore how one´s social status  besides Internet access and competences  influences Internet use for information, transaction, communication and entertainment. Our findings suggest that high- and low-status groups cultivate different forms of Internet-in-practice. For example, high-status groups combine information-related and particular entertainment-related forms of Internet usage. This empirical result is consistent with the hypothesis of omnivorousness, which says that a pure high-brow culture orientation increasingly loses in importance, while combining information- and entertainment-oriented forms of Internet use themselves become a means of cultural capital. We conclude that digital inequalities among individuals in low-status groups might be moderated by improving equipment and increasing digital competences, but that they will not completely disappear."

For a healthy psychological development, individuals need to accomplish important developmental tasks, such as individuation and identity formation processes. Transitional objects, such as the teenage diary, facilitate adolescent girls this difficult passage into adulthood acting as soothing mechanisms, while helping them to develop their identity and family independence. New technologies have created digital options for the publishing of self-narratives in cyberspace: blogs. Blogs give the same psychological support as the teenage diary, but they also insert the adolescent girl into social contexts away from the family where she can practice social relatedness, self-presentation and emotional disclosure with real audiences. In this way, blogging makes possible resistive activities that allow girls the creation of an identity sitting in tension to standard gendered values proscribed by mainstream society and girls families."

Many of these initiatives rely on the Internet, mobile technologies, and other emerging digital technologies for organizing, information dissemination, and community building. However, the Internet is undergoing a fundamental transformation. While the parameters of this new converged media system are already becoming visible, its ultimate shape and direction will be determined by a number of policy and market developments that are still under deliberation. This paper will: 1) provide an overview of several key technological, policy and market trends that will affect the civic and political potential of the digital media; 2) profile the youth organizations that are participating in technological innovation and policy advocacy over the future of the Internet; and 3) offer recommendations for public and private initiatives designed to maximize the participatory potential of digital technologies by youth."

The teens have limited access to making media outside school, but some of their teachers integrate media production into the curriculum. Based on participant observation in the school, and home visits and interviews with teens and their parents, the study examines the importance and limitations of making different kinds of media (digital video, image poems, etc.) from the perspective of the teens. While the youth often find the structure of media assignments too school-like and boring, they find enormous value in having access to certain media tools, learning the craft of production, and having an audience. In this way, creating digital media at school can support learning, but not necessarily that which is typically valued in education, and not without negotiating the tensions of adult authority and a restrictive school curriculum.

Lisa Tripp is Assistant Professor of School Media and Youth Services at Florida Sate University in the College of Information. She received her Ph.D. in Communication from the University of California, San Diego in 2002 and began collaborating on the digital youth research project while working as an ethnographer and associate director of USCs Institute for Multimedia Literacy (IML). At the IML, she helped develop professional development programs for teachers related to media arts and media literacy, and also conducted research related to those initiatives."

This paper examines public policies on digital switchover in Italy, from their formulation under the centre-left governments (1996-2001) to their implementation under the centre-right governments led by Silvio Berlusconi (2001-2006). The analysis broadly corroborates what has been argued examining digital transition policies in a number of other industrialised countries, most notably the importance of domestic agendas in explaining governments motives behind the formulation and implementation of such policies. At the heart of the initiatives on digital switchover in Italy is the issue of competition in the terrestrial television market, historically characterised by the duopoly of Berlusconis Mediaset and state broadcaster RAI. Depending on the political orientation of the government in office, digital transition in Italy has primarily been about either breaking the RAI-Mediaset analogue-based duopoly or extending it into the digital future. The general underlying argument of the paper is that digital switchover in Italy offers a very interesting case to discuss the way domestic political and economic interests have shaped the introduction of a major new technology."
2007-0424,Dimensions of Journalistic Culture,Political Culture and Journalism Culture: Theoretical Approaches,,,,Paper,Dimensions of Journalistic Culture,Political Culture and Journalism Culture: Theoretical Approaches,"Journalistic culture is of high relevance for cross-national communication research because it draws attention to a new unit of analysis: Between the individual news worker and the society as a whole sits the meso-level where the organizational and inter-organizational environment represents an important factor that shapes news production. Based on cultural and institutional theories, the paper argues that journalistic culture provides an important link between macro and micro level influences, and that it is essential in explaining why the news in some societies shares many similarities while being different from others. Since journalistic culture evolves from the interplay of individual worldviews, organizational constraints and societal structures, it is a key concept in identifying those factors that shape a news system's identity. In comparative research it helps us see how diverse contextual configurations (on the level of political or media systems) account for cross-cultural variation in the organization and production of news. The paper will (1) explain why and how journalistic cultures have evolved and (2) map journalistic cultures onto a set of empirical indicators that allow cross-national comparison."

In this paper we propose the use of new software tools and methods of analysis to determine the manner in which political leaders and social issues were covered in online news stories during the Canadian federal election (December 2005 to January 2006). In so doing we point out the biases of online news aggregators such as Google News, specifically the degree to which large commercial news outlets dominate such Internet news sites. This paper though is primarily concerned with applying new online research tools and methods to study of online news, in particular as formatted by the information powerhouse Google. With the widespread use of digital databases and online search engines come the persistent problem of search queries and parameters. Online news research requires a deft deployment of keywords to produce data sets of online news stories. A researcher therefore must already be relatively knowledgeable in his or her area of study as only a slight change in keyword search language can produce wildly differing types of news stories. Consequently in this paper we look to disaggregate or parse the various keyword tags, date stamps and other digital codes embedded in news stories that Google, Yahoo, Altavista and others use to rank and retrieve online news stories, as well as consider some of the larger contextual factors that structure query returns. In so doing we seek to delineate the possibilities and pitfalls of conducting digital news research."

The Political Possibilities of the Spectacle of Suffering,The Mediation of Suffering and the Cultivation of Community,"This paper examines disaster coverage in the British press across time, to investigate the political possibilities of the spectacle of suffering. It is based on a qualitative multiple-case study in which the coverage of six national disasters from the 1920s onwards is examined in two national papers, The Times and the Daily Mail. Using discourse analysis, we focus on how ordinary people are represented in the coverage, on how governments and other authorities are held to account, and on how journalism tries to make moral sense of these tragedies. We examine how emotional story-telling has changed, and how it is used to construct particular subject positions for disaster victims and witnesses. We look at how disaster coverage can play both a therapeutic role of providing healing in afflicted communities, and a political role of calling for action and accountability. It does this through discourses of horror, anger, empathy and grief."

Using a framework of multiple identity construction, the study reveals that female public relations practitioners engage in a constant process of disciplining and controlling their female and professional identities, specifically disciplining their physical bodies and controlling their professional communications. Three reasons for such negotiation were identified through additional literature research and data analysis. Theoretical and practical implications as well as recommendations for future studies are offered."

In an attempt to exert control over the Web as a journalistic space, the mainstream press used rhetorics of professionalism to discipline online news seekers into conforming to the definition of news favored by the mainstream press. This essay analyzes these tactics and their implications for the Webs journalistic potential, and concludes with a call for a more collaborative online journalism that maintains journalistic credibility while also incorporating a wider variety of perspectives."

In the context of divorce, parent-child divorce related disclosures influence how family members cope with the in that particular stressful event (Coyne & Gottlieb; Golish, 2003). Disclosure as communicative coping strategy may have both beneficial and deleterious effects on the child, parent, and their relationship. This paper will offer an explication of disclosure as a communicative coping strategy, then examine disclosure through three theoretical perspectives: human development, social cognitions, and information regulation."

The concept of sustainable development (SD) was intended to facilitate this integration, but has fallen short. Given the political might of the corporate sector in the twenty-first century, such an expanded community cannot begin to develop without significant contributions from the private sector. The corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement may enable a shift toward sustainability by encouraging critical examination of the spaces between humanity and nature, material and symbolic, and subject and object. For example, CSR should encourage corporations to approach the conundrum created by modern societys investment in technology that enables control over nature, while simultaneously degrading the earths capacity to support human life."

genderqueer young people in rural parts of Kentucky and Tennessee use media-circulated discourses to negotiate and articulate their sense of trans identity. Specifically, I examine what two trans-identifying rural youth make of their engagements with the same Discovery Channel documentary. The comparison is used to highlight how the dialectic between digital circulations of realness and material conditions of class and location shape the queer identity work of these two young people. In each case, the young person cites a rerun (literally a recycling) of a 1984 documentary as a pivotal moment in their expression of gender identity. The analysis pushes past a moment of reception into how these young people make sense and use of these media engagements in their lives towards different ends. The details of these two young peoples lives raise the question of how rural queer and questioning youth transform media consumption into identity production. While we have a rich tradition within feminist and queer scholarship
theorizing gender performativity, I would argue that we have much to learn from looking at how discourses of gender transition and
transgression play out on and interplay with the body. Here, I will argue that genres of queer realness set particular expectations of
normative transgender embodiment. At the same time, the conditions of young rural peoples livesin this example, most notably class status and its links to physical location and access to healthcareimportantly reconstitute popular discourses of what it means to be trans (and how to go about becoming trans) into individual experiences of gender that both complicate and stabilize how these youth and their communities do gender."

Discursive ruptures point to moments of failure, conflicts, de-stabilizations, and discontinuities within a set of practices, which in turn signal openings for transformation. Using a critical multicultural paradigm, we examine the discursive rupture surrounding U.S. ethnic/racial identity through two case studies: an analysis of dominant constructions of HIV/AIDS in the Black community and 2006 news coverage of Latinas/os and immigration. Together both case studies de-center dominant categories of ethnic and racial identity by emphasizing the discursive ruptures created through binary and essentializing media narratives."

The print media has undergone a paradigm shift in which free newspapers have moved into the mainstream and coexisted with the traditional newspapers in many cities. This paper examines this paradigm change by investigating the conceptual business model of the free newspapers. We propose to call the business model for the free newspapers distribution-driven journalism. This model provides a new form of newspaper operation mechanism which challenges the century-old content-driven journalism. This model is built around the notion of distribution. The distribution channel preselects the type and size of desired readers and they in turn determine the advertising revenue. The free newspaper content and format are derivatives of the reading experience in the distribution environment and the type of readers thus attracted. In other words, distribution is the primary driving force affecting readers, contents and revenue."

Against this European background, this paper analyzes the political debate and policy development currently generated in two neighboring contexts where very different stances are being taken with regard to public broadcasting: Flanders and the Netherlands. The paper digs into the diverging arguments and actions of the leading political parties, regulators and broadcasters that are at stake on the future PSB remit, e.g. the mission and program task, organization, financing and the position of public broadcasting on digital platforms. Comparing recent debates and policy making in both countries the paper concludes that despite very different traditions there seems to be a convergence of public broadcasting policies in Flanders and the Netherlands in recent years."

A Study on the Relationship Between Online Deliberation and Structural Design,High Density Session: Deliberation & Democracy Online and Off,,,,Paper,Diverse and Regulated? A Study on the Relationship Between Online Deliberation and Structural Design,High Density Session: Deliberation & Democracy Online and Off,"Along with the rapid development of the Internet, the amount of online discussion texts also increases fast. However, there are relatively few studies analyzing the quality of these online opinions and even fewer researches exploring the factors that might influence the quality. This study focuses on online political discussion groups during the 2004 election, whose discussion texts are submitted to a content analysis of deliberation. Deliberation here is defined as exchanging reasons with disagreeing opinion holders while showing respect to opponents. Measures of deliberation include counting reasons discussants provided and non-respectful words or phrases they made. In addition, this paper examines whether the quality of discusses is varied in terms of diversity and regulation. Diversity refers to the components of discussants, whether they are homogeneous or heterogeneous, in other words, Republican/Democrats only or mixed. Regulation is measured by a set of questions regarding facilitating efforts. Results show that for number of reasons, there is a significant main effect of diversity. For number of non-respectful words or phrases, homogeneous groups with low regulation demonstrated more mutual respect than homogeneous groups with high regulation; the direction was reversed among heterogeneous groups. Limitations and further studies are discussed at the end of this paper."
2007-0437,Do Ads Influence How We Set Health Goals?: Effect of Prime Strength and Time Frame on Perception of Behavioral Control,pact of Two Types of Advertising on Health Behavior: Direct-to-Consumer and Social Marketing,,,,Paper,Do Ads Influence How We Set Health Goals?: Effect of Prime Strength and Time Frame on Perception of Behavioral Control,Impact of Two Types of Advertising on Health Behavior: Direct-to-Consumer and Social Marketing,Perceived behavioral control is a behavior predictor that had been mostly overlooked in the research on media influence on peoples behavioral intents. The present study aims to contribute to the body of research on this behavior predictor. It is suggested that media influence control beliefs by either priming or changing them. It is also proposed that the time frame is a feature of the strategic message that can affect perception of control as well. An interaction of message strength and time frame are also discussed.

The study found that children comply to restrictive mediation the most, followed by active mediation and finally coviewing. Younger children complied more than older children. Parent and child reports of compliance and mediation were analyzed for discrepancies. Parents tended to overestimate their mediation guidelines and children overestimated how much they comply with those guidelines. In general, discrepancies between reports increased with age. Parenting style was found to be an important variable for compliance. Permissive and authoritarian parenting styles were negatively correlated to compliance with these guidelines, while authoritative parenting was positively correlated with compliance."
2007-0439,Documenting Conspiracy: The Loose Change Series and Foucaults Problematization of Parrhesia,Parrhesia in the Public: The Ethics and Practice of Truth-Telling in Mass Media,,,,Paper,Documenting Conspiracy: The Loose Change Series and Foucaults Problematization of Parrhesia,Parrhesia in the Public: The Ethics and Practice of Truth-Telling in Mass Media,"Loose Change is a controversial series of films that reinvestigate the 9/11 attacks upon the USA. Independently produced on a small budget by non-professional filmmakers, the films are freely available on the internet and are comprised of an unfolding assemblage of diverse materials in feature-length documentary forms. This paper examines how this assemblage connects to and seeks to challenge and disrupt the constitution of the Bush war machine by unveiling the truth in the form of a conspiracy: the Bush administration planned the attacks and subsequent collapse of the WTC towers as a pretext for invading Iraq. Rather than deal with their factual accuracy, the paper asks how this line of thought constitutes itself as truth. It draws on Foucaults ideas on the production of knowledge and his problematization of Parrhesia to contend that Loose Change tells us a great deal about truth telling in contemporary society."

The Role of Presence in Online Advertisments,Current Issues in Advertising Research,,,,Paper,Does Being There Increase Message Effectiveness? The Role of Presence in Online Advertisments,Current Issues in Advertising Research,"Research in the area of presence and message effectiveness is scarce. The current study examines the role of presence in online advertising message effectiveness. Interactivity is thought to be a key factor in eliciting presence. Interactivity has also been linked to message effectiveness. Two websites were designed (an interactive and a non-interactive) for a fictitious product to examine whether presence affected advertising message effectiveness. Results indicated that presence can positively affect an individuals attitude toward the brand, attitude towards the product, and purchase likelihood. However, individuals who experienced presence on the non-interactive web site responded more favorably to the advertising messages than those on the interactive web site. Langs Limited Capacity Model and Hoffman and Novaks model of Flow were used to interpret the findings. Implications for advertisers are discussed as well as limitations and directions for future research."
2007-0441,Does Childrens Advertising Exposure Contribute to an Unhealthy Diet? Refining the Big Food Advertising Effects Hypothesis,Top Papers in Instructional and Developmental Communication,,,,Paper,Does Childrens Advertising Exposure Contribute to an Unhealthy Diet? Refining the Big Food Advertising Effects Hypothesis,Top Papers in Instructional and Developmental Communication,"Television food advertising is often named as a cause for the increased prevalence of childhood overweight. This popular conception is driven by the Big Food Advertising Effects Hypothesis (BFAE): Children who are often exposed to advertising for high-calorie big food are expected to have a less healthy diet than children who are less often exposed. The present study refines the BFAE hypothesis by focusing at the differential impact of childrens food advertising exposure at a brand and a category level. In a diary study in 234 households with children aged 4 to 12 years, we investigated the relation between childrens exposure to big food advertising and their consumption of (a) advertised brands, (b) big food products, and (c) food products overall. Our results show that exposure to food advertising was significantly related to childrens consumption of advertised brands and big food products, but not to more generic food consumption. In other words, consistent with communication theories predicting spill-over effects of advertising, the impact of TV food advertising generalized to other brands within the same product category as the advertised brand. Thus, our findings confirm the assumption that advertising exposure unbalances childrens diets, and thereby ads to calorific intake."

How Corporate Social Responsibility Contributes to Organizational Trustworthiness,Relevance and Evaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility Activities: New European Findings Drawn From Media Coverage and Stakeholder Expectations,"The study focuses on analyzing the importance and impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the perception of the companys overall reputation and trustworthiness within major stakeholder groups like employees, politicians, financial analysts and customers in order to examine potential differences and similarities. Following the assumption that the companys CSR activities have an impact on the companys image, reputation and trustworthiness (Carroll 2004; Schnietz & Epstein 2005) and thus in the long run also affects the intended behaviour of stakeholders (Chahal & Sharma 2006), we developed a structural equation model in order to measure the impact of the above mentioned relations. To test the model, we surveyed four stakeholder groups of an Austrian telecommunication company. The results show that CSR has a positive impact on the companys trustworthiness in all groups, which strongly contributes to a positive attitude towards the intended stakeholders behaviour in terms of purchase and recommendation intention."

A Survey of Public Relations Scholars Perspectives,Public Relations Profession and its Professionals,,,,Paper,Does (Linking with) Practice Make Perfect? A Survey of Public Relations Scholars Perspectives,Public Relations Profession and its Professionals,"The academia-industry interface is important to the growth of a field and can encompass various aspects, such as research orientation, collaborative relationships, and dissemination of knowledge. Despite some discussions in the past mentioning that public relations academics should try to link their work to the needs of the industry, the general thinking and perceptions of public relations scholars as a whole were unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the current study conducted a Web-based survey completed by 273 public relations educators and scholars in 2006. Overall, the findings showed the respondents were in favor of building closer ties with the industry to produce better research and strengthen the academy, and perceived a gap currently existing between academics and practitioners. Interestingly, the opinions on potential measures for bridging this gap were found to vary by respondents education level and extent of professional experience. Implications and directions for future research were discussed."

Two Tests of the Anger Activism Model,formation Systems: Persuasion by Negative Emotion,,,,Paper,Does Message-Induced Anger Facilitate or Debilitate Persuasion? Two Tests of the Anger Activism Model,Information Systems: Persuasion by Negative Emotion,"The study presents the Anger Activism Model (AAM) predicting that for proattitudinal audiences anger facilitates pervasion and for counter-attitudinal audiences anger is detrimental for attitude change. In addition to the feelings of anger about the issue, message-induced anger was examined. The predictions of the model were tested by 2 experiments using a 2 x 2 independent groups experimental design. Based on feelings of anger and perceptions of efficacy, participants (Nstudy_1 = 175; Nstudy_2 = 140) were clustered into 4 groups: activist, empowered, angry, and disinterested. Results were consistent with the predictions: Proattitudinal individuals high in anger and efficacy perceived greater message persuasiveness, and were most willing to engage in more difficult behaviors. For counterattitudinal individuals, anger debilitated persuasion. Implications, limitations, and further research directions are discussed."

Issues of Measurement Equivalence for Self-Construal,Top Three Papers in Intercultural Communication,"This study compared three methods of elicitation of identity (self-construal) data from 947 participants (471 South Koreans, 472 Americans). Two open-ended measures, asking participants to write an essay describing identity and using the 20 Statements Test (Kuhn & McPartland, 1954), were coded for independence and interdependence and then using an interval scale for degree of presence of the trait so that open-ended data could be compared with scaled self-construal data based on valid items taken from the combined Singelis (1994), Gudykunst (1996), and Kim & Leung (1996) self-construal scales. The results of this study provided some limited confirmation of the validity of independent self-construal as in previous studies and disclosed further problems for the interdependent identity construct. This result suggests that tapping self-construal is a much more complex process than initially thought."

An Exploratory Investigation,Game Studies Interactive Paper Session,"This experiment examined effects of violent video game play and personality on aggressive cognition, affect, arousal, and behavior. Participants completed a measure of personality and approximately 4 weeks later participated in a lab study. In the lab, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions (first person shooter violent video game, third person shooter violent video game, nonviolent video game, or control), played a video game for 15 minutes in the treatment conditions, and completed measures of aggression. Results indicate that participants who played the third person shooter game reported more negative and aggressive thoughts than did those who played the first person shooter and the nonviolent game, respectively. In contrast, those who played the first person shooter vs. other games engaged in more aggressive behavior. The personality dimensions of conscientiousness, neuroticism, and agreeableness were related to aggression and video game condition interacted with conscientiousness, neuroticism, and intellectualism to predict aggressive outcomes."

The current study combines this finding with work in cognitive psychology showing that priming subjects to the very task of duration judgment increases the effect. To do so, an experiment was conducted where 5-minute commercial pods were comprised either of 5 60-s commercials or 10 30-s commercials. Subjects were randomly assigned to conditions where they were either told to listen to the stations and provide their opinions or specifically instructed that the stations were interested in opinions about their advertisements."

An Investigation of the Message Framing Effect,Best of Information Systems Division,,,,Paper,Does Psychological Reactance to Loss-Framed Messages Dissipate the Negativity Bias? An Investigation of the Message Framing Effect,Best of Information Systems Division,"Previous findings regarding the relative persuasiveness of gain- versus loss-framed health messages have been mixed. Some studies show that loss-framed messages are more persuasive, a finding that has been attributed to the negativity bias  the tendency for people to overweigh negative information when forming attitudes. There are, however, other studies demonstrating that gain-framed messages are more effective than loss-framed messages or that both types of messages are equally persuasive, in contradiction to the negativity bias. Drawing upon the theory of psychological reactance, this research proposes a theoretical model that accounts for the dissipation of the negativity bias and reports an experiment that has been conducted to test the validity of the theoretical framework. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed."

The results showed that the employment of coordinated television and print program promotions led to higher attention from audiences, improved memory, higher perceived message credibility, more positive attitudes toward the promotion and toward the program, and higher viewing intention compared to using repetitive single-source promotions. By incorporating cognitive variables such as attention, memory, and attitudes, this study initially bridged the theoretical gap between message exposure and viewing behavior in promotion studies, and has the potential to aid television networks, media professionals, and academic researchers to a better understanding of cross-media promotion effects."
2007-0450,Does Tailoring Matter? Meta-Analytic Review of Tailored Print Health Behavior Change Interventions,Health Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Does Tailoring Matter? Meta-Analytic Review of Tailored Print Health Behavior Change Interventions,Health Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Although there is a large and growing literature on tailored message health behavior change interventions, it is currently not known if or to what extent tailoring works, nor is it known what variables moderate the effect of tailoring on health behavior change. The current study provides a meta-analytic review of the literature on tailored print health behavior change interventions. A comprehensive search strategy yielded 61 studies that met inclusion criteria. Those studies, which contained a cumulative N = 58,139, were subsequently meta-analyzed. The sample-size weighted mean effect size of the effect of tailoring on health behavior change was found to be r = .079, and a number of variables were found to moderate that effect. Interventions targeting certain health behaviors, those which compared tailored messages to no-treatment control conditions, and those tailoring on certain theoretical concepts were found to have the largest effects. Implications for the future application of tailoring to health behavior change interventions are discussed."

A Meta-Analysis of the Behavioral Component of Third-Person Effect,The Third-Person Effect and Behavior: Research and Reviews,"This meta-analysis and in-depth synthesis provided an overall picture of the behavioral component of the third person effect. The behavioral hypothesis speculates that the magnitude of third-person perception is a sound, if not the best, predictor of behavioral outcomes. Thirty empirical studies addressing the hypothesis empirically were located, among which 10 published and unpublished studies with 26 separate effect sizes were examined in the quantitative aggregation. The overall effect size between third-person perceptual discrepancy and subsequent behavioral intention was r=. 13. Limited by the dearth of the literature, three potential moderators (type of behavior, respondents and method) failed to yield any significant differences in the behavioral intention; nonetheless, it showed that the effect size of behavioral component tends to be greater in the context of censorship than other types of behaviors. Also, college students tend to report higher behavioral intention as a function of perceptual bias than other people. The study calls for mass communication scholars to expand the knowledge of the behavioral component by constructing more theoretical frameworks, applying the triangulation of methodology and reporting statistics friendly to later empirical investigation."

2007-0453,Doing It for Themselves: Young People and E-Participation From the Ground Up,Digital Media and Youth Civic Engagement,,,,Paper,Doing It for Themselves: Young People and E-Participation From the Ground Up,Digital Media and Youth Civic Engagement,"Much contemporary discussion about young people and e-participation expresses optimism about the possibility of using digital media to promote civic behaviour amongst a generation that is currently alienated from the conventional political process. Based upon this assumption, a number of governments, political parties, charities and pressure groups have devised policies intended to engage young people online. But many young people have established their own online networks which are intended to work around the conventional political process and establish new forms of political organisation, often more closely associated with popular culture than instrumental collective action. This paper explores the contrast between these two approaches to youth e-participation. Through interviews with key actors in six online youth participation projects, it considers the discursive and empirical differences between top-down and ground-up youth e-participation. The paper concludes by
addressing policy options: Should governments and other major institutions seek to use ICT to engage young people or should they engage with projects that young people are creating on their own behalf?"
2007-0454,Doing the Right Thing Online: A Survey of Bloggers Ethical Beliefs and Practices,The Politics and Culture of Blogging,,,,Paper,Doing the Right Thing Online: A Survey of Bloggers Ethical Beliefs and Practices,The Politics and Culture of Blogging,"This study explored ethical beliefs and practices of two distinct groups of bloggers--personal and non-personal--through a worldwide web survey. A stratified purposive sample of 1,224 bloggers provided information about their blogging experience, blogging habits, and demographics. They were also asked about their beliefs and practices for four ethical principles: truth telling, attribution, accountability, and minimizing harm. The findings reveal that the two groups differ in terms of who they are and what they do in their blogs. There were also significant differences in the extent to which they value and adhere to the four principles and some interesting similarities. For example, both groups believe attribution is most important and accountability least important. While scholars have proposed blogging ethics codes, we found bloggers themselves are quite ambivalent on the necessity of a code."

Change Logics and the Adoption of CSR,The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,"Being a responsible corporation and adopting CSR are not necessarily one and the same. Behind any organizational change initiative, there are a variety of rationales or logics identifiable. Building on our chapter, which focuses on management fashions role in CSR/sustainability, my presentation is an attempt to explore the notion of change logics and how this concept may be useful in analyzing a companys CSR or sustainability initiative. Most organizational changes embody multiple change logics, some explicit and overt and others implicit or covert. I describe four levels of change logics discernible in and some of the ways they may be seen to interact in CSR initiatives."

Unfortunately, girlie feminism shows a blithe ignorance of issues of class, race, and sexual intersectionality that marginalized feminist theorists have struggled so hard to make central to scholarship and activism. Although proponents of the girlie insist that their project is necessary to rescue feminist politics from the strident Second Wavers who would make feminism no fun at all, I will argue that this sort of divisive characterization of radical feminists represents a backlash mentality that does nothing to advance feminist politics.
This paper also situates girlie feminism in the contemporary popular intellectual moment that unfortunately tends to prize a politics of self-conscious individualism over a politics of material social change. Although I will show that there may be interesting links between girlie identification and a radical politics of performativity, ultimately these links do not seem to be fruitfully pursued by girlie feminists. Finally, I will examine the case of the Craftivism movement in order to illustrate the failure of girlie culture to be truly engaged with an effective feminist politics, and to point to useful directions this movement might take."

An Investigation of the Impact of Spokescharacter Appearance on Children's Purchasing Influence,The Uses and Effects of Media Among Children,,,,Paper,Do Looks Really Matter? An Investigation of the Impact of Spokescharacter Appearance on Children's Purchasing Influence,The Uses and Effects of Media Among Children,"Children typically have immature cognitive abilities that may render them incapable of recognizing persuasive messages, and children and preteen adolescents may lack self restraint in appraising advertisements and marketing tactics due to inadequately developed social and moral judgment and limited life experiences; therefore, these special populations deserve research attention as advertising increasingly influences the majority of family purchase decisions, especially for food products and dining options. The present study contributes to the growing body of literature on advertising to children. One prominent tactic used by advertisers when targeting children is the use of spokescharacters. The purpose of this research is to determine whether the independent variable of a spokescharacters appearance impacts purchase influence/intention with children. Stimuli were created featuring an original spokescharacter marketing a fictional breakfast cereal via 30-second commercial. 258 children (N = 258) participated in this experiment, which employed a between-subjects design. Overall results showed no main effect for spokescharacter appearance; main effects were found for cognitive level of development, thereby yielding useful results for both advertising scholars and practitioners targeting children."

Hybridity, too often written in high theory without teachingexemplars, is ripe for writing moments that attempt to capture, not reality, but how identities are enacted in real moments and how those identities have material consequences in the real word. This essay braids together the authors Latino hybrid identity with that of a Mexican singer trying to crossover into U.S. popular culture. In the end, both of their identities speak to the relations between body and discourse and the difficulties of enacting and legitimizing hybridity. Dr. Shane Moreman is an assistant professor at California State University, Fresno. Dr. Moreman has published his work in several anthologies and is part of a thriving corpus of Latino/a Performance Studies scholars in the Communication field. This coming spring he will be teaching a short course on performance ethnography and tourism in conjunction with Universidad Xochicalco in Ensenada, Mexico."

Social Networks, Isolates, and Health Information","Message and Social Features Affecting Information Seeking, Risk Perceptions, and Personal Disclosures About Health","It is important to determine where people seek their health information in order to better target messages. Interpersonal networks are a common way most people gather health information, but some people have limited networks. Using data from the 2004 General Social Survey (n = 719), we compared social isolates and nonisolates in their health information-seeking behaviors. Results indicate that those with limited social networks are less likely to use interpersonal communication (family, friends, and health care providers) to seek health information, and are also less likely to use mediated channels including television, radio, and the internet. While isolates were no less likely to use newspapers, they were less likely than nonisolates to use magazines to seek health information. The results suggest that isolates may also be suffering from a health knowledge gap."

A Test of Attentional Spotlight, Cognitive Load, and Affect-as-Information Theories",Best of Information Systems Division,"Made (in)famous by advertisers, the pop-up window is one of the most prevalent modalities in computing environments. Yet, very little is known about how it affects the processing of information in and around the pop-up window. We propose that three different mechanisms, derived from attentional spotlight, limited capacity, and affect-as-information models, could explain the effects of pop-up presence on the extent and nature of information processing on a Website. A 2 (same vs. different pop-up location) x 2 (number of pop-ups1 versus 3) x 2 (pop-up contentadvertisements vs. factoids) factorial experiment was employed to test the above-mentioned mechanisms. Free recall and recognition of the various news stories on the Web pages where pop-ups appeared were used to indicate the extent and nature of information processing. At the same time, facial EMG, skin conductance responses and heart-rate measures were used to check the attention-grabbing, interruptive, and annoying nature of pop-up windows that are implied in the 3 mechanisms. Our findings suggest that pop-ups direct users attention towards a specific location on the screen, and that information located in their vicinity benefits from this movement of the attentional spotlight. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

News directors say they have no preconceived gender bias related to their hiring decisions, but a double standard does exist. Those women that do get jobs are often hired more for their physical looks than their skill, which suggests a relatively short career track. Other implications are also discussed."
2007-0462,Downbreaking News: Toward a Dramaturgical Approach to Popular Media and Public Communication,Where News & Politics Meets Entertainment,,,,Paper,Downbreaking News: Toward a Dramaturgical Approach to Popular Media and Public Communication,Where News & Politics Meets Entertainment,"The paper addresses TV news increasing rootlessness in the recent environment of popular media where highly dramatized infotainment programs compete for audience applause. What stands behind TV news loss of importance is, it will be argued, its inability to attract a group of engaged viewers who would be willing to engage with it, who would be ready to learn and cultivate the discourse it offers. Conventionally, factual media power has been grasped as the tacit, transparent, repetitive production of reality. However, in the late modern media environment, the illusion of verisimilitude does not successfully mediate factual media power. It is increasingly mediated by intentional taste discrimination practices through which people engage with cultural products they find more attractive and valuable than others. News, seen by viewers, rather naively, as a mere window to the world, is simply beyond the above taste judgements. Treating news neither good, nor bad, just a fair collection of events, the viewer rarely engages with it as his or her favourite program  and, consequently, evades its effects. The above argument will be illustrated by empirical data taken in Hungary, highlighting the relative effectlessness of TV news, compared to other, more engaging, infotainment programs. This inefficiency will be traced back to the lack of audience engagement with TV news. In line with these findings, a ""dramaturgical"" approach to popular factual media will be deployed, locating media power less in ""repetitive"" and routine media exposure than in enthusiastic immersion in heightened, dramatized, performance-like experiences."

Many citizens speak out against the zoning change due to the risk to the drinking water as well as other issues. Citizens face the speakers problem of how to make their presentation convincing given the technical matters involved and that Town Board members have likely already heard about these issues. Some speakers draw on the words of others in their presentation. Using anothers words allows the speaker to cite an authoritative source or to respond to what another has said, to evaluate it, and often to challenge it. Speakers use other devices in addition to quotes such as formulations, repetition, and membership categorizations to develop their evaluative stance in the reporting context. Our focus is the discursive construction and rhetoric of using others words for the speakers own purposes."

These impressions could very well be based on social categories, with this information mirroring those perceptions and beliefs held in society. The present study attempted to examine the relationship between impression traits as applied to media characters and their relationship to resulting emotional responses. According to the results, while the impressions formed across various media characters are similar to those formed of marginalized groups in reality, the resulting emotional responses are quite different. This suggests there may be more freedom within the media realm emotionally, yet stereotypes persist reinforcing the existing social structure."

It is hypothesized that students with higher educational attainment will recall numerous and positive messages emphasizing the importance of education versus infrequently hearing or advocating the opposite position when compared to those with lower educational attainment. Additionally, type of support is purported to affect achievement, so that students who graduated will recall more emotional and instrumental support messages than will students who did not graduate. 80 subjects completed an in-depth interview about their experiences in high school. Perceived helpfulness emerged as the only statistically significant and substantial predictor of educational attainment. A post-hoc causal model was created with perceived helpfulness mediating the effect of instrumental messages and loss-framed messages on educational attainment. Pregnancy, parental income, gender, sibling dropout, and message repetition appeared to exert direct effects on educational attainment. Directions for subsequent tests of this model are discussed."

The main hypothesis investigated was whether increases in the emotional intensity of threat-oriented stories would increase experiential processing such that its effects would extend beyond affective to cognitive domains. In addition, it was predicted that the rational system would modulate the effects of experiential processing at low but not at higher emotional intensity levels. Individuals with varying proclivities to process information rationally and experientially were exposed to a news story scaled for its emotional intensity. They indicated the degree to which the story: (a) was diagnostic of the threatening phenomenons prevalence, (3) represented a serious problem, (c) made them feel apprehensive, and (d) made them feel sorrow and sadness. Experientiality exerted significant effects on all of these judgments, thus demonstrating that within the narrative domain, experientiality can influence cognitively-oriented judgments; however, although rationality exhibited significant effects on the first 3 judgments, it did not impact on the empathic, sorrow-sadness judgments. These results were accounted for by potential dynamical relationships between the rational and experiential systems when they process emotional narratives."
2007-0467,Early- and Late-Maturing 12- to 15-Year-Olds Involvement With Sexual Media Contents,Toward a New Agenda for Research on Media Use and Adolescents Sexual Socialization,,,,Paper,Early- and Late-Maturing 12- to 15-Year-Olds Involvement With Sexual Media Contents,Toward a New Agenda for Research on Media Use and Adolescents Sexual Socialization,"It has repeatedly been hypothesized that effects of exposure to sexual contents may be moderated by a viewers involvement with these contents (perceived realism, viewing motives, viewing activity). Increased viewer involvement, in turn, has been suggested to develop from changes in young adolescents pubertal status. The latter hypothesis will be empirically explored in the present paper. We used data of a longitudinal study in which a panel of Flemish 12-year-olds (N=1452) was followed in three consecutive years. First, growth mixture modeling was used to identify different trajectories of maturing in early adolescents; using different typical means and variances for the intercept and slope of pubertal maturation, these analyses distinguished clusters of adolescents that can be described as precocious maturers, late maturers, slow maturers, and fast maturers. Second, it was examined whether adolescents following different maturation trajectories are differently involved with sexual media contents and whether their involvement tends to be changing over the years in different ways. The consequences of these results for future research on sexual media effects are discussed."

Two leading African newspapers were studied: the Daily Nation of Kenya and The Guardian of Nigeria within the first 100 days from April 7th to June 29th. It was determined that (bane of a nation) Rwandan national introspection, an(other) African cataclysm, together with world inaction and indifference were the dominant factors in the coverage of the Rwandan tragedy."
2007-0469,Economic Growth and Advertising Expenditures in Different Media,"Ownership, Advertising, and Market Structure in Media Industries",,,,Paper,Economic Growth and Advertising Expenditures in Different Media,"Ownership, Advertising, and Market Structure in Media Industries","This paper explores the relationships between economic growth and advertising expenditures in 18 industrialized countries. Previous studies not only show that advertising expenditures co-vary with economic growth, but also that different media (in different countries) are differently affected by economic decline. This paper investigates some of the underlying mechanisms. Using estimates in constant national currency, the paper shows that advertising expenditures respond more closely to GDP in countries where newspapers are a more important advertising medium, or where the economy relies more on advertising, than in other countries. The advertising intensity of an economy, in turn, depends negatively on the contribution of agriculture and exports to GDP. These findings are relevant for scholars and practitioners who predict and plan advertising in different media as well as for those who want to understand the impact of the economy on media conduct and performance."
2007-0470,Economics of Newspapers Presidential Endorsement Decisions: Evidence for Endogenous Product-Type Choices of Media Firms,Elections Coverage,,,,Paper,Economics of Newspapers Presidential Endorsement Decisions: Evidence for Endogenous Product-Type Choices of Media Firms,Elections Coverage,"This study investigates the effects of local markets political preferences on newspapers political orientations. Newspapers presidential endorsements are the firms endogenous decisions on the location of their products in the ideology space. Using the 2004 US presidential election, this paper shows that a newspaper reader becomes more likely to have a local newspapers presidential endorsement decision closer to his political preferences as a local market includes more people sharing his political preferences. This paper uses the demographical characteristics of each local market as instrumental variables to identify a causal effect of a local markets political preferences on a local newspapers presidential endorsements."
2007-0471,Editors Notes and Transparency: What Do Major U.S. Newspapers Deem Noteworthy? - Top Student Paper,Redirecting Journalism To Society and Its Citizens,,,,Paper,Editors Notes and Transparency: What Do Major U.S. Newspapers Deem Noteworthy? - Top Student Paper,Redirecting Journalism To Society and Its Citizens,"U.S. newspaper reporters and editors have heard a chorus of calls for greater transparency in recent years. Journalists are being told to lift the curtain and tell readers how the news is gathered and produced. Yet little research has shown whether journalists are heeding such calls. This exploratory study content-analyzes editors notes at major U.S. daily newspapers and finds little evidence that they are being used to increase transparency. Although editors notes have generally become more prevalent, that trend appears to be tapering off. Editors notes are seldom used to explain reporting and sourcing methods. Moreover, such notes typically are written from a third-person point of view rather than taking a more conversational approach."

Educationof patients, families, and medical staffis an equal necessity. Without training and explanation, the best telemedicine project cannot succeed.

Education overcomes certain barriers to adoption and usage, while increasing effectiveness and satisfaction with the new systems. As medical practitioners become more educated about telemedicine, they also become more aware of its benefits.

The addition of these technologies can improve the effectiveness of the workplace and also enrich the working environment by enhancing communication among stakeholders. Finding the time and opportunity to educate staff about telemedicine is another story, however.

Project designers must learn to take advantage of existing routines and perceptions to tap into opportunities. Working within current social networks and management structures to get buy-in from multiple levels of the organization is also essential."

To test the proposed hypotheses, a 2 (plot connection: high vs. low) x 2 (product involvement: high vs. low) x 2 (previous attitude toward the brand: favorable vs. unfavorable) one between- and 2 within-subject factorial design was implemented. The results of this study will provide marketers and advertising agencies with useful insights into using product placement strategies as a marketing communication tool. In addition, the results suggest that many factors should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of a placement."

Furthermore, it also investigated how the memory strength and criterion bias associated with them will be affected regarding the different valence of the messages where words are present. In order to do that, signal detection theory was applied to the study as a theoretical framework along with LC4MP. Interestingly, the results show that positive words were better remembered but negative words were not. When it come to considering message valence together, the same emotion between word and message turned into better memory for positive and neutral words. However, negative words didnt get affected by message valence and showed the poorest memory. Memory strength and criterion bias were not significant for emotional words processing, not considering message valence. But, in processing emotional words in radio advertisements, positive words got the strongest memory strength and showed the changes in judgment criterion when message valence was considered."

In addition, we examined individual differences in emotional expressiveness and responsiveness to media content. Participants were randomly assigned into either a dyadic or individual viewing condition. Results show that in the presence of peer coviewers, participants enjoyed the comedy more and tended to synchronize several of their reactions to the program with the coviewers."
2007-0476,Effect of Web Organization and Prior Knowledge on Online Learning,king and Providing Information Online,,,,Paper,Effect of Web Organization and Prior Knowledge on Online Learning,Seeking and Providing Information Online,"The Internet is being the one of the most influential media, and thus it is important to understand how the different web organizations influence obtaining knowledge. Recently, communication researchers have maintained that the nonlinear web would enhance obtaining structural knowledge, while the linear web would promote declarative knowledge learning. This experimental study investigated the theme further to find the influence of prior knowledge on learning structural and declarative knowledge via differently organized webs. The preliminary results showed that there was certain tendency to support that the nonlinear structure promotes structural knowledge gain and high prior knowledge users are more advantageous on the nonlinear web, even though the numerical values did not reach a significant level. However, learning declarative knowledge was not affected by the structure of the web."

Few studies have investigated the mechanisms governing the effects of EE on preschool childrens psychosocial outcomes. This study tests a model of EE effects that posits that three cognitive mechanisms mediate the relationship between preschool childrens exposure to EE programming and psychosocial outcomes: character recognition, liking the program, and self-perceived learning from the program.
In a national household survey designed to test the proposed model in Egypt, there were significant relationships between exposure to Alam Simsim, Sesame Workshops Egyptian co-production, and character recognition, liking the program, and self-perceived learning. Exposure effects on outcomes of interest (math and literacy skills and gender attitudes) were rendered non-significant when mediators were included in the model, suggesting the mediating mechanism has an indirect effect on outcomes."
2007-0478,Effects of Anger on Message Production and Message Content in Negotiations: Have You Been Hijacked?,"Well-Being, Anger, and Arguments",,,,Paper,Effects of Anger on Message Production and Message Content in Negotiations: Have You Been Hijacked?,"Well-Being, Anger, and Arguments","The purpose of this paper is to answer one question: How do strong emotions such as anger affect message production in the context of negotiations? In the quest to answer this question, this paper examines whether or not emotions such as anger can hijack the message production process. The paper addresses what being hijacked by anger means, what factors lead to the message production process being hijacked by anger, and what effects hijacking has on the content of the messages. As a result of answering the above questions, a model based in Dillards (2004) Goals-Plans-Action (GPA) Model and a cognitive appraisal theory of anger is presented to explain the effects of anger on the message production process and message content in the context of negotiations. The goal of building this model is to first explain what is going on when a calm negotiator changes into an angry and out of control one who lashes out abusively in negotiations. If the message production process can in fact be hijacked by anger the next goal is to be able to figure out what is going on cognitively so that the process can be slowed down so that a person can be trained to use a more effective form of anger expression while negotiating such as in the integrative-assertion mode of anger expression. Training may not only prevent hurtful interactions, but also help the negotiator maintain credibility and sound cognitive ability which will enable him/her to obtain their goal in the negotiation."
2007-0479,Effects of Benefit-Target Framing on Intentions to get Vaccinated for Avian Influenza,Biases and Frames for Health Risks,,,,Paper,Effects of Benefit-Target Framing on Intentions to get Vaccinated for Avian Influenza,Biases and Frames for Health Risks,"In recent years, health officials have become increasingly concerned about the possibility of a pandemic of avian influenza, which could occur if the virus becomes more easily transmissible between people (Nesmith, 2006). To attempt to prepare for such an outbreak, several drug companies currently have vaccines in development (Griffiths, 2006). However, adult vaccine compliance has historically been low (Blue & Valley, 2002). One strategy health promoters can consider in the context of infectious diseases is to emphasize the message that getting vaccinated not only protects the person receiving the immunization, but also his or her loved ones, and even unknown others to whom the disease could be spread. A framing study was conducted to test the effects on intentions of emphasizing benefits to loved ones or unknown others versus consequences to the self. Through the on-line survey company Knowledge Networks, a 5-minute experiment was conducted with a nationally representative sample (N=244). Subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: self, close other or society. Each read a paragraph, then answered intention questions. The framing manipulation had significant main effects on intentions to get the vaccine if it were free (F=3.44, p<.05) and on intentions to seek information about the vaccine (Welch=3.74, p<.05). Surprisingly, messages about benefits to unknown others or society were just as effective as those about loved ones. Stratification of results by gender revealed the effects were completely moderated, such that benefit-target framing only affected men. Possible mediators and implications for health promotion campaigns are discussed."

It is asked, how citizens do use traditional (Print & TV) and new (Internet) mass media as sources for political information, and how media use mediated by factors like education or political interest mediate information acquisition and emergence of knowledge-gaps. Furthermore, it will be analyzed on the basis of dual-process theories like the ELM, how citizens do form political judgments and to what extent these judgments are influenced by media coverage on the one hand and specific information processing strategies (heuristic and central) on the other hand? Results regarding the knowledge-gaps and the political judgment processes will be presented."

This study explored whether coplaying a videogame with peer-players mediates the game players experiences in violent and nonviolent gaming contexts. A 2 (Solo, Coplay) x 2 (Violence, Nonviolence) within-subject design experiment was conducted (N=32). The results demonstrated that coplaying moderated the game players physiological arousal during violent and non-violent videogame play. While coplaying produced less physiological arousal during violent game play. Conversely, coplaying led to a significant increase of the players physiological arousal during nonviolent game play. Furthermore, coplaying enhanced the players sense of presence and identification. The results highlight the moderating role of coplaying on game players emotional experiences."

Cultural Diversity and Visual Communication (High Density Session),"This paper examines visual elements of TV commercials that influence viewers affect, perception, and purchase intention. Based on theories differentiating cultures along the dimensions of contextuality as well as individualism and collectivism, an experimental study was designed to test the effects of culture-congruent visuals on viewers affect, perception and behavioral intentions, in contrast to culture-incongruent visuals. These manipulated visuals included presence or absence of a visual story line, early or late brand acknowledgement as well as individual or group images within commercials. 2 experiments were conducted with U.S. and Chinese college students utilizing the same stimuli and equivalent measurement. For U.S. viewers, results consistently pointed to the effectiveness of culture-congruent visuals, despite a reverse effect from commercials with individual images. For Chinese viewers, results were inconsistent, indicating that the influence of culture congruent factors is probably more complicated than commonly assumed."
2007-0483,Effects of Directional and Nondirectional Motivations on Information Processing,formation Systems Interactive High-Density: Emotion and Motivation Underlying Information Processing,,,,Paper,Effects of Directional and Nondirectional Motivations on Information Processing,Information Systems Interactive High-Density: Emotion and Motivation Underlying Information Processing,"A model of motivation and information processing was proposed and tested with a computer-based experiment using political campaign information (N = 197). The model suggests that motivation to a particular candidate, a directional epistemic motivation, has a direct effect and motivation to think about election, a nondirectional epistemic motivation, has indirect effect on biased information processing. Motivation to a particular candidate was operationalized with strength of party identification and motivation to think about election was operationalized with the level of interest in politics. The pattern of biased information processing was examined with several characteristics of candidate evaluation trajectories, which consisted of candidate evaluation at 11 time-points. Participants with strong party identification showed smaller negative change in response to attitudinally incongruent information (H1), showed a greater attitude polarization in response to balanced information (H2), and showed lower frequency (H3) and smaller amplitude of candidate evaluation trajectories (H4) than participants with weak party identification. The level of interest in politics showed both direct and indirect effects on biased information processing."
2007-0484,Effects of Discussions in Online News Forum on Corporate Reputation,Public Relations and Digital Media,,,,Paper,Effects of Discussions in Online News Forum on Corporate Reputation,Public Relations and Digital Media,"This study tests the effects of online discussions about a company in an online news forum on peoples perception of corporate reputation of the company. The study is a 2 (tone of comments: negative vs. positive) by 2 (number of comments: one vs. five) full factorial design experiment (N = 80) in which participants read an online new article about a company and peoples comments about the article. The results showed that there was a significant interaction effect between the tone of comment factor and the number of comment factor with regard to perception of social responsiveness and employee treatment of the company. However, it was found that the main effect of the number of comment factor would apply only to participants who read positive comment(s). It was also discovered that a multiple number of comments led to higher perception of website diversity and quality. We discuss implications of the current study on PR practices for corporate reputation and the multiple source effect."

Participants from the United States and Hong Kong were shown ads containing either false or true (control) information about a typical childhood experience at a theme park. Message processing environment (systematic versus heuristic) was also manipulated. Results indicated that participants who were in the false ad condition were more likely to make judgment errors about their past experiences, suggesting that the false information had modified and become part of their memories for these past experiences. Heuristic processing also increased the occurrence of reconstructive memory effects. The effects of the false information held even after controlling for the strength of participants prior memories and their familiarity with the false information cues. No country-of-origin differences were observed. However, additional analyses showed that high ad involvement and sex (men) were also associated with reconstructive memory effects."
2007-0486,Effects of Gain vs. Loss Framed Antidrug Ads on Adolescents,pact of Two Types of Advertising on Health Behavior: Direct-to-Consumer and Social Marketing,,,,Paper,Effects of Gain vs. Loss Framed Antidrug Ads on Adolescents,Impact of Two Types of Advertising on Health Behavior: Direct-to-Consumer and Social Marketing,"Improving the effectiveness of antidrug ads is an important public health concern. Central to achieving this aim is identifying the message strategies that address the differential characteristics of adolescent audiences. This study examined the effects of gain vs. loss framed antidrug ads on adolescents with different social and behavioral characteristics. A posttest only experiment was conducted to examine if these audience factors moderate the effects of message framing. Loss frame messages, rather than gain frame messages, were more persuasive for adolescents who report that their friends use drugs. Neither gain nor loss framing had a persuasive advantage for adolescents who report that their friends do not use drugs, although this outcome may be the result of a ceiling effect. Similarly, the pattern of results provided limited support for the prediction that loss rather than gain frame messages will be more persuasive for adolescents who have used drugs. Implications of the results for future theory and research are discussed."

Whether learning occurs as a result of such messages likely depends on the way speakers think about the message. This study investigates the cognitive and affective mental states that follow a regretted message. The first objective was to determine whether a speaker's emotional state following a regretted message is influenced by the goal the message was incongruent with, the attribution made, and the seriousness of the offense. A second objective was to observe whether 10 types of reflection on a regretted message (formulating a rule to avoid a recurrence, attributing a cause, etc.) can be predicted by 6 factors (type of goal incongruency, emotional state, causal attribution, seriousness, relationship type, and concurrent reflection). A third objective was to identify factors influencing a speaker's perception of having learned from the experience and his/her estimate of the likelihood of making the same mistake again."

Using a posttest-only group experimental design, college undergraduates (N = 195) viewed a set of five hip-hop music videos of either high or low sexual content. Male participants in the highly sexual condition indicated greater objectification of women, sexual permissiveness, stereotypical gender attitudes, and acceptance of rape than male participants in the low-sex condition. In addition, hip-hop fandom played a significant role in participants objectification of women and sexual permissiveness. Implications are discussed within the frameworks of vicarious learning through the media and parasocial interaction with media figures."

However, the linkages between media distrust and decreased political participation might not be self-evident. Rather, citizens media distrust may in some part represent healthy skepticism which is related to citizens active political participation through their effortful information search and exchange. These ideas are tested with a national survey data on 2004 presidential election. Findings show that media distrust was positively related to citizens online information seeking and offline political discussion, which, in turn, affected their diverse campaign participations. These effects of media distrust appear to be channeled through citizens communicative participation such as online information search and face-to-face political discussion which then facilitate citizens political activities."
2007-0490,Effects of Message Contextuality and Nationality,New Directions in Intercultural Communication Research,,,,Paper,Effects of Message Contextuality and Nationality,New Directions in Intercultural Communication Research,"This study explores Edward Hall's idea of high-context and low-context theory. It looks at the effects of contexting conceived as a message variable in the form of print advertisements on attitudes and behavioral intentions. It also looks at the interaction of message contextuality with nationality (Japan and the United States) to explore contexting as it occurs in both messages and cultures. Based on a pilot study, 8 print ads from Japan and the United States, which reflected three levels of contextuality (high, medium and low) were responded to by participants from Japan and the United States in terms of visual/verbal focus, attitudes toward the ads and behavioral intentions. The results showed a strong effect for message contextuality (significant main effects on all dependent variables) and a high degree of interactions between message contextuality and nationality (about 70% of the dependent variables). The study demonstrates the importance of conceiving of contextuality as a message variable and the relationship between message contextuality and cultural contextuality."

A 3 x 2 x 2 design manipulated message sidedness (supporting one-sided v. nonrefutational two-sided v. refutational two-sided), source trustworthiness (high v. low), and source goodwill (high v. low) to measure their effects on attitudes toward the message, the issue and the company. MANOVA results revealed no three-way interaction, but a main effect for source trustworthiness and a two-way interaction between message sidedness and source goodwill. Implications for public relations strategy and for the possible role of Weblogs  the message format used in the study  are discussed."
2007-0492,Effects of Reality in High-Definition Television Viewing on the Experience of Presence,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Effects of Reality in High-Definition Television Viewing on the Experience of Presence,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,"Presence is often considered as an experience of being engaged by the representations of a virtual media such as the images shown through high-definition television (HDTV). The concept of reality is divided into two dimensions: sensory reality and cognitive reality. Sensory reality refers to the fidelity of images that makes viewers feel close to the real world by the stimuli of HDTV images, which is often manipulated in the previous research using the quality of image definition. Cognitive reality is measured in terms of the degree of realness of narrative shown to the viewers.
Based upon such conceptualization, this study attempts to explore the effects of reality shown through HDTV upon viewers media experience of presence.
This study used a one-between, one-within subjects experimental design. A total of 82 subjects participated in the experiment. Subjects were randomly assigned to eight experimental conditions.
As for the effects of reality on presence experience, high-definition image appears to have distinct effects on experiencing presence. However, reality-based narrative did not necessarily have an effect on presence experience. Rather, non reality-based narrative showed higher mean values, although not within the significance level.
As for memory effect of presence, the hypothesis was not supported. Two other variables, arousal effect and entertainment effect were supported. They were found to have a positive effect as a result of presence experience in the viewing of HDTV."

We present a study, in which the sampling advantage of shared information was moderated by features of the information environment. In prior studies on information sharing in groups, information items were typically provided in form of unique cues, which described only one of the considered choice options. We included an experimental condition, in which some information items were provided in form of common cues, for which all considered options had a value. As expected, groups in the classic unique-cue condition showed a stronger sampling advantage for shared information and detected hidden profiles less often than groups in the common-cue condition. Results underline that studying the information environment can help us to better understand information sharing in interacting groups."

Further, previous research in any country has tended to examine such images from an a priori framework of general impressions and stereotypes of older people. This study addresses these issues with British consumers (n=106) impressions, trait ascriptions, and similarity between images ratings of a representative sample of UK magazine advertisements featuring older characters. After a series of sorting task laboratory sessions, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses revealed six clearly defined groups, representing potential types of portrayals. These types emerged from the advertisements themselves, as it were; emerged from the views of the consumers themselves. These emergent groupings are proposed, very cautiously, as a preliminary typology of advertising uses of images of older people. The 6 types, (1) Frail, Vulnerable, (2) The Touts, Fake and Posed Models, (3) Elder Statesman/Grande Dame, (4) Cheeky, Comedy Old People (5) Proper Old Folk, Reassuringly Typical, and (6) Sporty, Fit, Athletic, appear to be a logical context-appropriate derivation from previous findings on generally held stereotypes of older persons. It is argued that the groupings have the potential to develop into a reliable typology of advertising portrayals of older people, with heuristic leverage in social scientific research of intergenerational communication, lifespan concerns, and the ageing process."

Cultural Diversity and Visual Communication (High Density Session),,,,Paper,Elite Imaginations: The Visual Spatialization of Luxury and Privilege in Mediatized Tourism Discourse,Global Visuals? Cultural Diversity and Visual Communication (High Density Session),"This paper exemplifies the kind of contribution visual communication scholarship can make to the rapidly growing field of critical tourism studies. From the combined perspectives of social semiotics and critical discourse analysis, we start by recognizing how mediatized texts and the social practices of which they are a part can be tremendously powerful in reconstituting substantial areas of social life. On this basis, we examine the visual representation and production of space/place in a corpus of over 100 tourist advertizing images. Our analysis shows how the visual texturing of space is a key resource in tourism marketing and which establishes a powerful regime of (un)truth about luxury, exclusivity and privilege. This is established through a combination of key semiotic resources (e.g., the frequent depicition of unnamed, feminized, neocolonial places) and other design strategies (e.g., the exaggeration of exclusion through the absence of people and through perceptual effects of emptiness and order). Our concern is that this particular visual-spatialization of tourism discourse also works to (re)produce an elitist ideology of class distinction and social inequality."
2007-0498,Embedded Photojournalism and Identification With U.S. Soldiers,Critiquing Iraq War Coverage: Four Years Out,,,,Paper,Embedded Photojournalism and Identification With U.S. Soldiers,Critiquing Iraq War Coverage: Four Years Out,"During the initial stage of the invasion of Iraq, 2003 the majority of photographs printed in newspapers were taken by embedded journalists. This study explores the visual frames employed by and audience reception to photos created by embeds in Iraq. After creating four common image categories I investigate the audiences readings of the photos. A semiotic analysis was employed in order to identify the dominant meaning encoded within the photographs. A series of focus groups was then conducted in order to discover whether audiences typically utilize dominant or alternative readings when interpreting the images. The results indicate that the preferred meaning encoded within the photos encourage audience identification with American soldiers, and that most participants accept this meaning and take on positions of identification with Americans but not Iraqis."

Following a brief synopsis of perceptual simulation theory and its implications for language in general, and metaphorical language in particular, implications are discussed for other, perhaps more traditional communication issues including framing, intentionality, and comforting, as well as for the slightly less traditional topics of humor and playful communication."

Blogging Culture and the Question of Technological Effects,The Politics and Culture of Blogging,"Technological potential, meaning the possibilities suggested by a new or developing media technology, is usually left out the the debate between social constructivists and scholars who treat technology as a historical force. In this paper I suggest a way to think about technological potential by putting into dialogue two notions that arise often in recent communciations literature, though rarely together: the technological affordance, and the emergent property. As a scaffold for relating these two concepts I examine a newly evolved communications genre, the news-related blog."
2007-0501,Emerging Cultural Paradigm in Public Relations Strategies for Social Change,Developments in Public Relations Theory Building I,,,,Paper,Emerging Cultural Paradigm in Public Relations Strategies for Social Change,Developments in Public Relations Theory Building I,"This paper describes the cross-pollination taking place between the communication for development literature and the public relations fields. This interaction is resulting in an exploration, by practitioners and scholars in the public relations field, for new ways to incorporate diversity into the design, implementation and evaluation of communication strategies for social change. This paper argues that the multicultural context pervading most strategies for social change is bringing about a paradigmatic shift in the field of public relations. The result is a greater focus on a public-culture-centered approach for more effective and equitable strategies. Additionally, a description of how key concepts in the communication for development literature have impacted the direction of public relations research and practice is offered. Finally, this paper introduces a culture-framing approach to identify diverse issue frames associated with multicultural groups. Strategic messages and tactics can be generated to target marginal groups using this approach to ensure equitable representation of worldviews in social change efforts."

Our research investigated whether previously documented patterns of gendered behavior on the Internet, such as higher levels of fear and anxiety depressing usage among women, carried over to these new online social locations. We conducted four focus groups with heavy, medium and non-users of social network sites (n= 35) and administered a survey to a convenience sample of undergraduate students at a mid-size research university (n=304). 83% of the students reported having profiles in a social network site. While men remained somewhat heavier users of the Internet, women had much higher levels of adoption of social networking sites (91.6% of women versus 74.5% of men). Closer analysis of the data revealed gendered patterns of use: women were more likely to use the sites to keep in touch with their existing friends while men were more interested in meeting and networking with new people. While female students reported higher levels of privacy concerns and complained more of unwanted contact, they also posted more pictures of themselves. Female students seemed to try to manage their privacy concerns by restricting access to their profiles: women were twice as likely to restrict their profiles' visibility to only their SNS ""friends,"" compared to men. The results are especially interesting since fear and anxiety, although they impact self-presentation strategies, do not depress usage, suggesting motivation and availability of access are also important factors in mediating this relationship. It remains to be seen how gender differences in usage and attitudes will change as the Internet continues to evolve into a pervasive, everyday technology with increasingly social uses."

The Choose or Lose series was an unlikely discursive blend, mixing MTVs usual fare of music, celebrity, and style, with serious information, issue coverage, and social advocacy. It also experimented with the parameters of journalistic authority, combining elements drawn from a traditional paradigm of professional journalism with a variety of alternative, emergent claims to credibility, all in hopes of reaching a demographic that largely has tuned out from news and politics. To explore the changing nature of journalistic authority as articulated on MTV News, this study first develops a theory of discursive integration  the blending of once-distinct discursive domains, standards, and styles. It then identifies 5 potential models of journalistic authority constructed in the Choose or Lose series. It concludes by considering the implications of discursive integration and the ongoing reconceptualization of journalistic authority for young peoples engagement with broadcast journalism."
2007-0504,Emotional Communicative Processing of Television News Among Peers,Emotions and Communicative Processing of Media Content,,,,Paper,Emotional Communicative Processing of Television News Among Peers,Emotions and Communicative Processing of Media Content,"Although news programs have been usually considered a typically informational media genre, current research suggests that they are followed not only from a rational point of interest but also from an emotional motivation (Döveling, Hoffmann 2006). Along with this perspective, an experimental study addressed the role of social interaction within news reception. 40 dyads (friends and couples) were presented a TV-news report and then asked to discuss it. Conversations were taped in order to analyze how it is processed communicatively. 40 individuals in the control group singly watched the report without subsequent interaction. In both groups evaluations and opinions were measured.
Confirming the above mentioned assumption, dyads discuss news content on an emotional basis and cope with their evaluation interactively. Discussions increase the salience of selected issues and affect their subsequent perception. Communication partners reassure their personal assessments of the news and adjust their positions in the course of conversation. This demonstrates the vital role of social interaction in coping with TV-news."
2007-0505,"Emotional Intelligence, Self-Esteem, and Interpersonal Communication Satisfaction",terpersonal Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,"Emotional Intelligence, Self-Esteem, and Interpersonal Communication Satisfaction",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Paper Session,"This study based on a sample of 292 college students shows that interpersonal communication satisfaction can be predicted by individuals emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is operationalized based on Golemans (1998) conceptualization including self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. The study suggests that those individuals, who are aware of themselves and others, and who are able to manage themselves and others, tend to satisfy their communication experience with others. However, the study indicates that self-esteem (Gecas, 1971) does not have significant impact on college students interpersonal communication satisfaction. This finding raises possibilities for further investigation in the area. Limitations and suggestions for future studies are provided."
2007-0506,Emotions Across Media: Transportation Into Written and Filmed Narratives,Creating and Controlling our Emotional Environments via Selective Exposure to Entertainment Media,,,,Paper,Emotions Across Media: Transportation Into Written and Filmed Narratives,Creating and Controlling our Emotional Environments via Selective Exposure to Entertainment Media,"Transportation into a narrative world is a psychological mechanism through which narrative communication can affect beliefs. Transportation, or absorption into a story, entails emotional responses, mental imagery, and cognitive focus. For some stories, individuals can choose to experience a text or film version of the narrative. Written presentations may require more effort, but do not typically supply visual images. The current studies investigated whether transportation was affected by the medium of story presentation. A field study showed that people who read a novel before viewing a film version of the same narrative had a higher level of transportation into the film, and that this higher transportation seemed to be driven by greater emotional involvement. A laboratory experiment supported these findings, and investigated individual differences in preferences for films versus books. The willingness to exert mental effort appears to provide greater transportation and emotional payoff from media use."
2007-0507,Emotions in Negotiation Processes: An Extension of the Appraisal Model,Emotions and Communicative Processing of Media Content,,,,Paper,Emotions in Negotiation Processes: An Extension of the Appraisal Model,Emotions and Communicative Processing of Media Content,"The study of emotional communication incited by the mass media and emotions within media reception processes is attracting greater interest in mass communication analysis. However, many questions remain unanswered. One of them is the role that negotiation processes in appraisal play within ones own emotional experience. Therefore, this paper explores the communicative processing of emotions, taking the Stimulus-Evaluation-Check-Model (Scherer 2001, Lazarus 1991) as a theoretical framework. The analysis focuses on the role of Social Appraisal (Manstead/Fischer, 2001: 221) as a reciprocal emotional exchange process, integrating the social dimension analytically into the complex appraisal mechanisms. This extension of the potential constituent of appraisal to the social realm will be underlined by collected data (explorative interviews made with fans of popular television shows) to demonstrate how the social dimension needs to be perceived as one key variable in emotional involvement with media content. This paper outlines a possible starting point for such a consideration of socially relevant emotional aspects as important variables in mass communication analysis."

I appropriate the becoming orientation to organizational discourse to trace the implications of emotion management for financial workers with particular emphasis on their efforts to gain control over investment process through strategic management of work relationships and constructing preferred identity. In doing so, I discuss in detail issues of discursive construction of professionalism, emotions as tools of strategic impression management, and the ways that discourses of professional emotional conduct reflect and reify larger discourses of power."
2007-0509,"Employee Health, Communication, and Absenteeism",Organizational Communication Interactive Session,,,,Paper,"Employee Health, Communication, and Absenteeism",Organizational Communication Interactive Session,"Absenteeism figures are increasingly applied as an integrated measure of health in the working population. However, a comprehensive overview of employee well-being (compromising the relative impact of physical, psychological, and organizational components) and how this relates to reported absence frequency and duration is still lacking. The present study investigates these relationships. The study has been conducted in a Dutch subsidiary of an international financial consultancy firm. Three types of data collection were used: a web-based survey among the firms employees, a physical health check, and the employees absence rates reported to the company. Together the questionnaire and the health check included the following clusters of independent variables: (a) personal characteristics, (b) job characteristics, (c) physical health, (d) self-reported well-being, and (e) perceptions of organization and communication. Of the 5 clusters of variables, the perceptions of organization and communication variables appeared to be the strongest predictors of absence frequency. This study did not find the assumed relationship between physical related well-being and individual absence duration."

Previous research suggested that pictures viewed from a search task elicit greater orienting and more accurate memory than do pictures viewed while surfing. The proposed study builds on this finding by exploring online news rather than pictures. We hypothesize that searching will lead to greater encoding and memory because information that addresses a predetermined need is signal information, which is motivationally important and should elicit greater attention. Furthermore, the predetermined need serves as sort of a mental anchor from long-term memory, to which incoming information can be attached."

Building upon 93 instances of encouragement in 65 actual warm line calls, this study describes 4 different methods of encouragement used by call takers: (1) multiple positive assessments; (2) assessments plus formulations (or accounts); (3) statements of agreement to a planned action; and (4) second assessments. Across these methods, call takers must do more than what is minimally required as a response in order to encourage and endorse good news."
2007-0512,e-Neighbors: Neighborhoods in the Network Society,Neighbours versus Friends Who Live Nearby: Communication Technology in Urban Neighbourhoods,,,,Paper,e-Neighbors: Neighborhoods in the Network Society,Neighbours versus Friends Who Live Nearby: Communication Technology in Urban Neighbourhoods,"This study examines the specific contexts where Internet use affords local interactions and facilitates community involvement at the neighborhood level. Studies of Internet and community have found that information and communication technologies provide new opportunities for social interaction, but that it may also increase privatism by isolating people in their homes. This paper argues that while the Internet may encourage both home-centeredness and communication across great distances, it may also facilitate interactions centered near the home. Unlike traditional community networking studies, which focus on bridging the digital divide, this study focuses on bridging the divide between the electronic and parochial realms. Detailed, longitudinal social network surveys were completed with the residents of four contrasting neighborhoods over a period of three years (suburb, apartment building, gated community). Three of the four neighborhoods were provided with a neighborhood email discussion list and a neighborhood website. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to model over time the number of neighbors recognized, emailed, met in-person, and talked to on the telephone. The neighborhood email lists were also analyzed for content. The results suggest that the Internet use has already been adopted into the maintenance of neighborhood social networks. However, neighborhood effects reduce the influence of everyday Internet use, as well as the experimental intervention, in communities that lack the context to support local tie formation. Early adopters of the Internet and active users of the neighborhood email list built larger weak tie networks over time."
2007-0513,"Enforcing Identity: Race, Class, and Religion",Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,"Enforcing Identity: Race, Class, and Religion",Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"Although journalists cannot control crime, they can control how they deal with its incidence. This paper examines, through analysis of a case study, how journalists strive to restore order to society in the wake of violent crime against those entrusted with policing it. When Fulton County Sheriffs Deputies Ricky Kinchen and Aldranon English were dispatched to arrest Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin in March 2000, they could not have anticipated the violence that would ensue. Gunshots fired behind Al-Amins grocery store leaving Kinchen dead and English wounded touched off a media frenzy. While Al-Amins eventual arrest for Kinchens murder ended a 4-day manhunt, Al-Amins capture forced journalists covering the case to confront the challenge of reporting the tensions between Al-Amins controversial past as the Black Panther H. Rap Brown and seemingly peaceful present as a Muslim cleric. Journalistic coverage of Al-Amin in the wake of his confrontation with police officers offers a powerful case study for thinking about the consequence of decisions made by journalists when narrating events. While journalists strove to create a narrative within which Al-Amins actions could be understood, the individual identities of officers Kinchen and English were displaced by the identities they maintained as part of the collective policing institution. For journalists, Kinchens and Englishs identities as police officers, agents sanctioned by the state, trumped any alternative mode of identification such as race, class, or religion. This paper examines the representation of these identities and the implications of journalists choices in narrating them."
2007-0514,Engaging the Entrepreneurial Self: A Study of Empowerment and Constraint Amongst White Women Entrepreneurs,Discourse and Organizational Narratives,,,,Paper,Engaging the Entrepreneurial Self: A Study of Empowerment and Constraint Amongst White Women Entrepreneurs,Discourse and Organizational Narratives,"Discourses of entrepreneurship and research on women entrepreneurs have proliferated in the last two decades. This study argues that a particular conception of an entrepreneurial self underlies much literature on women entrepreneurs and their empowerment, and identifies several key assumptions of the entrepreneurial self. The study then assesses the motivations and experiences of several white women entrepreneurs in a northwestern state in the United States, finding that aspects of the entrepreneurial self are most evident in the reasons that women provide as to why they become entrepreneurs. However, the experiences the women narrate reveal a more constraints-centered discourse, which features a particular interpretation of the frontier myth of the American West, and bears traces of an emergent, collective notion of empowerment. The authors explain such empowerment from critical and feminist perspectives, offering the concept of bounded empowerment as a lens to examine entrepreneurship and gender, and discussing its practical implications."

Moreover, little research has examined how Web users process informative information (search results) in conjunction with persuasive information (search ads). Drawing on varied theoretical perspectives, we propose that a particular dimension of informative information (search relevance) is critical in promoting information scent and affecting user attitudes. We report results from 3 between-subjects, factorial experiments that broadly examined persuasive effects of search relevance and ad relevance. Study 1 examined the interplay of search results relevance and ad relevance for two different search topics and showed that search relevance is the critical variable in influencing user attitudes. Building on this, Study 2 examined whether motivational factors can impact user attitudes toward both the search engine and the ad. Study 2 results were consistent with those obtained in Study 1. Finally, Study 3 examined whether adding a picture to a text-based search ad can influence persuasion. We point out the implications of the findings and recommend several directions for media effects research in the domain of search engines."
2007-0516,Entertaining Washington DC: The Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsements of Political Candidates,Advertising,,,,Paper,Entertaining Washington DC: The Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsements of Political Candidates,Advertising,"Over the course of the last decade, the boundary in the U.S. between Hollywood and Washington D.C. has become increasingly blurred. Celebrities are becoming ever more involved in the political process and celebrity endorsements of politicians have become regular staples of campaigns. However, it seems few people give any credence to the effects of celebrity endorsements. When asked, most voters indicate that individual endorsements rarely matter at all to them and celebrities rank extremely low among the individuals who do make a difference. Political strategists, on the other hand, suggest that celebrity endorsements are helpful in garnering attention and raising money for campaigns. However, despite a large amount of speculation, empirical research has not addressed the fundamental question: Are celebrity endorsements of politicians effective? Rooted in literature on persuasion and endorsements, this paper reports the results of an experiment designed to ask if celebrity endorsements of politicians are effective, who is persuaded, and why."
2007-0517,Entertainment Education and HIV Prevention,Communication Perspectives on HIV/AIDS for the 21st Century,,,,Paper,Entertainment Education and HIV Prevention,Communication Perspectives on HIV/AIDS for the 21st Century,"Entertainment Education (EE) has used serialized dramas on radio and television to educate and prompt positive, voluntary behavior change around the world since the 1970s. Many of these behavioral outcomes are relevant to HIV prevention. Stronger EE effects may result from adding other theoretical insights to those from Social Cognitive Theory, relying more on indigenous script writers and less on foreign consultants, providing HIV services and opportunities for face-to-face interaction to reinforce mediated messages, and conducting more empirical research. In the U.S., outreach to Hollywood writers and producers has resulted in HIV-relevant storylines that prompted change in intentions to be screened and to tell others to be screened among visitors to chat rooms for gay men, information-seeking and HIV stigma reduction among audiences including many minority women, and positive attitudes towards delaying sexual initiation among Hispanic teens. These studies responded to a research agenda that should guide future EE research."

Specifically, this essay reexamines and synthesizes previous rhetorical case studies implicating race, racism and whiteness in contexts of white European colonialism, fascism and racism in the U.S. I call this discourse white absolutism, which is embodied by religious and scientific absolutism, tribalism and scapegoating. White absolutism justifies purging the black and feminine threats to white masculine (national, regional and cultural) identity, to reestablish white heterosexual patriarchal control. I argue that white absolutism survives in contemporary public and media discourse through black scapegoating, and blackness endures as an symbol of negative and essential difference because it integrates ideologies and archetypes of evil."
2007-0519,Equivocal Messages as Organizational Response: Understanding Effects and Mechanisms on Corporate Reputation,Public Relations Response Strategies,,,,Paper,Equivocal Messages as Organizational Response: Understanding Effects and Mechanisms on Corporate Reputation,Public Relations Response Strategies,"This study examines the proposal that equivocal communication theory could provide a framework for crisis communication professionals to use in identifying situations that call for limited disclosure of information to external publics, and developing responses that are both appropriate for the situation and maintain the organizations reputation. In Study 1 (n = 300), individuals rated equivocal and nonequivocal spokesperson responses to hypothetical scenarios describing a corporate crisis that contained either an avoidance-avoidance goal conflict or an approach-avoidance conflict. As predicted, equivocally worded spokesperson responses, rather than direct responses, were viewed as more appropriate messages to use in avoidance-avoidance goal conflict scenarios. Equivocal responses were also associated with higher levels of corporate credibility and management commitment in avoidance-avoidance goal conflict situations. At the same time, non-equivocal responses were viewed as more appropriate and associated with higher levels of corporate credibility and management commitment in approach-avoidance goal conflicts than equivocal responses. A second study (n = 284) was conducted to replicate the findings of Study 1, and to examine potential mediating mechanisms for the findings; the results of the first study were confirmed. Study 2 also found that the situation variables of situation ambiguity, goal complexity, and multiple goal expression affected credibility ratings, they did not mediate the effects of goal type on credibility ratings."

In response to the rise of more personal and less official web presences by politicians, this paper examines the communication networks of politicians as expressed through the pattern of link connectivity contained on their (personal) blogs rather than (official) campaign sites.
Similar to the analysis of an invisible college in information science, this study analyzes the hidden structure of the South Korean political blogosphere using hyperlinks between politicians blogs. The sample for this research is drawn from the blogs of South Koreas National Assembly members class of April 2004 (N=107), and the data collection occurred during July of 2005. Several social network analytical techniques were employed to provide detailed information about the blog-specific linking practices within this group of politicians in South Korea.
The preliminary findings indicate that the links of more personalized and less official blogs do indeed demonstrate the continuity of socio-communicational networks among politicians. In Particular, politicians typically use blogs and hyperlinks to demonstrate party affiliation, gender, and regional ties, in a way similar to that of their official websites. The essay then discusses these results from within the political context of South Korea, and the political values expressed in many Asian nations."

It allows users to acknowledge other people on the system and to have their connection permanently cemented into the structure of the system... that is, until a breakup prompts an explicit destruction of the friend relationship both on and offline. This explicit articulation requires participants to consciously consider the social complications of adding or deleting someone. While friendship may seem like a simple matter, having to publicly list who is in and who is out is not that easy.

In this paper, I will examine how friendship is constructed in social network sites, how it differs from traditional understandings of friendship, and how friendship technology has complicated the negotiation of relationships between people. I will focus primarily on the friending process in Friendster and MySpace, drawing on three years of ethnographic data."

In this study, we aim to illuminate salient aspects of NGOs Web production practices, and the conditions under which NGOs engage other actors in networks, through an investigation of the fair trade coffee movement on the Web. Based on close examination of the Web strategies of NGOs promoting fair trade coffee between 2002-2006, and interviews with NGO members, our analysis focuses on strategic linking patterns in different networks. Of particular interest is how organizations that certify business compliance maintain careful strategic relations in networks with social movement organizations that campaign against many of the same businesses."

Results showed that participants willing or unwilling to donate organs posthumously or discuss with parents about organ donation did not differ in their perception of the prevalence of those behavioral willingness. Participants in both countries, however, underestimated the prevalence of willingness for organ donation and willingness for family discussion about organ donation."

The authors intend to identify the decision making process used in ethical considerations - the primary type of ethical paradigm issues managers use in making decisions for the coalition - as well as to explore the way those values and group consensus considerations influence their decisions. The authors advance a deontological theoretical framework for ethical decision making, explore the extent to which it is employed at the activist coalition studied, and make recommendations for practice and future research."
2007-0525,Ethics of Chinese Mass Media,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Ethics of Chinese Mass Media,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"This study has 2 purposes. The first purpose of this study is to examine the ethics of Chinese mass media. Particularly, it investigates how the media define their natures and functions, whom they are loyal to, and what ethical values and approaches they take to evaluate their roles and functions. The second aim of this study is to explore what organizational characteristics determine the medias loyalty and ethical approaches. This study uses Potters box to analyze the moral reasoning of 12 Chinese media outlets by examining their organization statements in terms of three categories: definitions (nature and historical facts), loyalties & values (functions and purposes), and ethical principles (consequentialism vs. formalism). It is found that the government is still the most prevalent entity that Chinese media are loyal to, audience is secondary. The propaganda of the governments policy is still the most important function of Chinese media. However, most media began to use consequentialism to evaluate their loyalty and function. Loyalty tends to be influenced by location, degree of commercialization but not by channel nor audience size. Ethical approaches tend to be influenced by the founding history and media channel but not by audience size. In sum, factors influencing Chinese media ethics include media environment (the modernization level, the number of party organs, competition level), organizational characteristics (target audience, channel, circulation, language, financial sources and income) and history (the founders purposes, its importance in the media network, the rate of commercialization, the adoption of new technology, and some special functions)."
2007-0526,Ethnic Boundaries in National Literatures,"Mediating Culture: Ethnicity, Race, and Cultural Representations in Popular Texts",,,,Paper,Ethnic Boundaries in National Literatures,"Mediating Culture: Ethnicity, Race, and Cultural Representations in Popular Texts","The subject of this paper is concerned with (i) assessing to what extent and in what ways the classification of ethnic minority fiction writers differs in American, Dutch and German literary anthologies and literary history books for the period of 1978-2006, and (ii) with the question of how the classification of ethnic minority writers may be affected by various structural and cultural factors. Both the amount of ethnic discourse in introductory texts and the numerical representation of ethnic minority writers indicate a total lack of attention to ethnic minority writers until the beginning of the new millennium in the Netherlands and Germany, while in the U.S. a situation of underrepresentation shifted to overrepresentation around 1990. These cross-national differences can be clarified by looking at the field of textbook publishing (U.S. and the Netherlands) and the national cultural repertoire (more specifically: ethnic exclusion in Germany). The structure of anthologies and literary history books is also examined, as is the labeling of ethnic minority fiction authors. Whereas structuring along ethnic lines is non-existent in all three countries, nearly all minority authors are discussed in ethnic terms, primarily by stressing ethnic themes. Cross-national differences - that is, emphasis on ethnic background (United States), ethnic descent (Netherlands) and ethnic literary genre (Germany)  can only partially be explained by the national repertoire theory."
2007-0527,Ethnic Identity and Identification with the Majority Group: Relations with National Identity and Self-Esteem,Highly Ranked Competitive Papers in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,Ethnic Identity and Identification with the Majority Group: Relations with National Identity and Self-Esteem,Highly Ranked Competitive Papers in Intercultural Communication,"Literatures on ethnic identity and acculturation have supported the orthogonal conceptualization and measurement of ethnic identity and identification with the majority group or the larger society. The author argued to conceptually differentiate identification with the majority group and national identity. A survey study with Asian American students (N = 91) and African American students (N = 115) in a large public university in Ohio, U.S.A. revealed no correlation between ethnic identity and identification with White Americans for Asian Americans and a small negative correlation at marginal significance for African Americans. These results support the orthogonal model. While identification with White Americans positively predicted national identity in regression analyses for both samples, ethnic identity also added unique main effect and suppressed the effect of identification with White Americans for predicting national identity among American-born Asian Americans.

Suggestions for future research include regional comparative studies and more elaborate models on perceptions of a society in terms of interethnic group dynamics."

Brussels journalists play a pivotal role in the European integration process. They act as agents of Europeanization, wedged between complex European issues and national public spheres, privileged in terms of information supply, geographical proximity and social networking. This study is one of the first to examine correspondents from new member states vis-à-vis the rest of the Brussels press corps, EU institutions, home offices and audiences. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 14 journalists from different new member states show that the current status of the new member states correspondents in Brussels could impede the emergence of a Europe-wide public discourse. The growing heterogeneity of the Brussels press corps reduces the relative importance of journalists from smaller member states and leaves them at disadvantage in the news-gathering process. Moreover, volatile and also tense media markets in the new member states, paired with little interest for EU affairs in these countries constrain the journalists news performance, leading them to stress national angles over European ones."

At the same time, scholars have noted the emergence of a European public sphere as issues relevant to the European project occur on national agenda and are debated with intensity at the same time in the national press. However, we examine how the media coverage in this emerging public sphere is framing the issue of EUropean integration. In particular, we examine how the conflict frame is used to present news about European actors and issues. By bridging the findings on the Europeanization of EP elections and the emergence of the public sphere, we question the potential for this possible European public sphere to create a European identity given the use of the conflict frame in European political reporting. We also show how information is related to attitudes and behaviour, specifically scepticism about the process of European integration and the decision to vote or participate in European parliamentary elections. The paper draws on content and survey data from 15 EU countries in 1999 and 25 EU countries in the 2004 European parliamentary election campaigns."

In Korea, all terrestrial TV as well as radio advertising time has been sold through KOBACO, the public corporation of media representative since 1981. By its origin, KOBACOs ad-pricing system was neither built for the sake of networks, nor for its own. For a considerable period of time, one major factor for increasing annual ad rate was inflation rate of nations economy. As time goes by, KOBACO has been changed. With a current effort of embracing free-market principle, KOBACO insists their pricing system reflects various factors: media characteristics, time bands, accumulated genre data, advertiser preferences, as well as supply and demand for a particular time slot. But we still doubt that KOBACOs pricing system is considerably behind to reflect a real value of ad time. Therefore our purpose of this research is to examine how well this system reflects, or related with sales-related market performance (product usage or purchasing data) in addition to the exposed audience size."

Cultural Diversity and Visual Communication (High Density Session),,,,Paper,Evaluating the Visual Communication Component of a Nutrition Education Intervention: A Question of Visual Representational Latitude,Global Visuals? Cultural Diversity and Visual Communication (High Density Session),"The paper discusses an ex-post evaluation of the visual communication component of a nutrition education intervention in an elderly target group at a care centre in Sharpeville, South Africa. Pauwels concept of visual representational latitude (VRL) was taken as a point of departure to measure the comprehensibility of 13 different semantic units that formed part of nutrition education pamphlets and posters. The results indicate that the average respondent in the sample of 140 participants was only able to recognise 49% of the subject matter depicted, and comprehended 29.1% of the pictorial conventions employed. The paper illustrates how the concept of VRL was operationalised in practice and highlights that a crucial first step in the evaluation of visual illustrations is to establish to what extent the basic 'building blocks' of the visual communication process, i.e. object recognition and comprehension of pictorial conventions, are in place."

The avatars (M = 100) varied with respect to gender and humanness, ranging from close representations of human form to inanimate objects. Information processing theory suggests that viewers will respond to potential avatars in the same way they respond to sources in the offline material world. That is, viewers will apply the same source evaluation and topic evaluation sequences to all source, regardless of whether they are online or offline. The humanness of the avatar triggered a 4-step causal chain in which perceived anthropomorphism increased the competence of the avatar, with competence increasing trustworthiness, trustworthiness increasing homophily, and homophily leading to reports that participants would select the image as an avatar. Part of the large positive effect of anthropomorphism on competence was mediated by the realism of the avatar, such that more anthropomorphic avatars were rated as more realistic, and the more realistic avatars were judged to be more competent. Realism increased homophily in 2 ways. First, realism improved the credibility of the source, with credibility boosting homophily; second, realism had a direct positive effect on homophily. A match of gender between the viewer and the avatar also augmented homophily."

The paper focuses on the influence of blog reliance compared to motivations for visiting blogs in determining credibility of blogs. This study found that blogs were judged as moderately credible, but as more credible than any mainstream media or online source. Both reliance and motivations predicted blog credibility after controlling for demographics and political variables. Reliance proved a consistently stronger predictor than blog motivations. Also, information-seeking motives predicted credibility better than entertainment ones."

The present study examines deception in online dating profiles using a novel cross-validation technique for establishing ground truth for online self-presentation. An analysis of 80 participants profiles suggests that the deviations between participants online self-presentations and the truth tended to be small but frequent. This pattern of deception is consistent with the Hyperpersonal models assertion that online communicators engage in strategic and selective self-presentation. The results also suggest that, when deciding what to lie about, users take into consideration both the technical affordances of online dating portals, such as the editability of profiles, as well as the more social aspects of online dating, such as warranting and relational goals."
2007-0536,EXACTLY: Exercising Entitlement in Next Turn,"Little Words, Big Results: How Single Words Accomplish Action in Conversation",,,,Paper,EXACTLY: Exercising Entitlement in Next Turn,"Little Words, Big Results: How Single Words Accomplish Action in Conversation","This paper examines the deployment of exactly as a response. Speakers use exactly to respond to confirmable assertions (e.g. when someone proposes something about a co-participants feelings, beliefs or actions) as a way to convey that the assertion hit the nail on the head. Speakers also can use exactly to assert an entitlement to confirm an assertion even when that entitlement was not a feature of the prior turns composition. In this position, exactly treats the prior turn as a proposal or candidate understanding even thought it was not delivered as such. By dealing with a prior turn in this way, speakers assert the authority to judge a claim for its accuracy or adequacy.
The use of exactly as a hit the nail on the head response to a confirmable can be seen in the following excerpt. Here Zack has just explained that sometimes he feels like a rapist when he has sex with his boyfriend. In response, Jason proposes to Zack two less extreme formulations of his (i.e. Zacks) action  which Zack is entitled to confirm. Zack strongly confirms both with exa:ctly.
[ P B & F ]
01 JASON: [So basically [you fee]l like you're talking
02 DANNY: [ Why:. ]
03 him into something he doesn't want to ?do:.=
04 ZACK: =exa:ctly.
05 (0.5)
06 ZACK: o[r,]
07 JASON: [ I]'m with you.
08 ZACK: rapinum.
...
09 JASON: [O]r just.
10 (0.3)
11 JASON: for[ c i ]ng him >to do something he doesn't=
12 DANNY: [°h(hh)°]
13 JASON: =[wanna do.<]=
14 ZACK: =[ e x a : c [tly. ]
15 JASON: =[yeah.]

In this way Zack aligns Jasons formulation with his own and conveys that what Jason has just proposed gets at the heart of Zacks original formulation.
This device can then be used for unintended confirmables to assert authority over something that a speaker is not prima facie entitled to confirm. Struggles concerning who is agreeing with whom (Schegloff, 1996) have been identified as one recurrent way in which the distribution of and rights to knowledge become a matter explicitly attended to by participants. By analyzing uses of exactly we can begin to see how claims of independent knowledge, and who is agreeing with whom, are consequential for a range of actions and sequential contexts, and the social world built through them."

The current project addresses this oversight through an investigation of intercollegiate (American) football contests between two heated rivals. A total of 554 individuals viewed one of 4 televised contests featuring the same hometown team: 2 against heated rivals, 2 against nonrivals. Results reveal that viewers clearly saw rivalry games as more violent than nonrivalry games. Moreover, games won by the hometeam were seen as more violent than those lost. Also, those perceiving high levels of violence reported greater enjoyment than those who perceived low levels of violence in all games. Finally, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that perceived violence contributes differently to the enjoyment of games won than games lost. Possible explanations for the findings are offered."

In recent years, however, there has been a growing trend of fabricated news, implicitly based on the assumption that reported reality would occur as it does even without the expectation of being reported and that TV news usually presents an undistorted picture of events. These assumptions are questionable because many such (mostly scandalous) events would never occur without the expectation of being reported. Thus instead of beginning with traditional content analysis based on qualitative case studies and/or quantitative data, future research should set off with examining the reality being covered, thereby determining how and why TV news fails to present a reliable and adequate picture of reality?"

A longitudinal study was done comparing participants who underwent group sessions with their meal replacment programs, those who pursued individual (private) treatment with their meal replacement program, and a control group of individuals who were not using the meal replacement program. Path models were tested examining the adherence to both the diet and exercise programs. For both the diet and exercise adherence path models, the influences of past behaviors, positive vicarious experiences, social undermining, and efficacy were found to be significant. Practical and theoretical implications regarding weight loss are discussed."

In this study we employed Ajzens (1991) theory of planned behavior as a theoretical framework in order to understand predictors of Internet usage among this underserved population. In doing so, we examined perceived trustworthiness, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control regarding browsing the Internet. Our findings show that participants who trusted the information they retrieved via the Internet were likely to maintain favorable attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control toward browsing the Internet. Additionally, we found that participants attitudes and subjective norms were not predictors of Internet usage. From a practical standpoint, these findings suggest that promotional efforts to decrease the digital divide among this underserved population should lobby organizations for Internet-ready computers and accessible public sites equipped with internet infrastructure. Furthermore, our findings suggest that increased efforts to educate the Hispanic population about the variety of Internet functions and its uses is needed to enable them to fully utilize the Internet and benefit from this valuable technology."

This paper presents survey data (N=866) from seven communities where health agencies were investigating possible local cancer clusters and holding public meetings to communicate with local residents. It extends research in procedural justice to public health communication settings to advance hypotheses addressing individuals satisfaction with public meetings and intentions to attend future public meetings. Independent variables included respondents previous meeting attendance, perceived efficacy of public meetings, and concern about the local cancer cluster, as well as their community attachment, community pride, and community identity. Results of hierarchical regression analyses, controlling for demographics, showed that perceived efficacy and community pride were significantly related to respondents public meeting satisfaction. Efficacy, previous meeting attendance, and risk perceptions were significantly related to intentions to attend future meetings. Overall, the results consistently suggest that when respondents believed public meetings were better able to generate useful discussion of community issues, such as about local cancer rates, they were more satisfied with the meetings and more willing to attend them in the future."

Recent research tests this measure with college students but research testing this conceptualization does not currently exist among primarily adult samples. Psychological Reactance Theory (PRT) states that individuals exposed to a threat or elimination of a freedom will experience reactance and subsequently be motivated to restore a freedom. Specifically, it is hypothesized that individuals will perceive persuasive messages containing forceful language as a threat to their personal freedom followed by output, manifested in a latent variable comprised of anger and negative cognitions. This hypothesis was tested within the context of persuasive messages aimed at encouraging members (N = 247) to participate in weight lifting or group exercise programs at XX Health & Fitness Center. Results support conceptualizing reactance as a 2-step process. Additionally, results indicate that a primarily adult sample responds unfavorable to forceful persuasive messages advocating the aforementioned exercise activities. In doing so, we support this comprehensive conceptualization and advocate health campaigners and PRT researchers to employ this measure to provide consistency to future PRT studies."

Research shows that movies typically portray smoking as a predominantly positive, adult behavior while rarely depicting the adverse health consequences as-sociated with smoking. Further, viewing movie smoking enhances viewers percep-tions about smoking and smokers and has a dose-response relationship with ado-lescent smoking initiation. However, exposure to antismoking public service an-nouncements immediately before watching movie smoking seems to blunt the film content congruent perceptual shifts. We argue that these emerging trends can best be understood within the framework of exemplification theory. The data at hand, we speculate, suggests that individual differences such as personality may moderate smoking exemplar sensitivity among adolescents."

In this study, 136 college students completed questionnaires measuring their anticipated reductions in perceived closeness to friends and media figures as a result of expectancy violations. Expectancy violations examined included major moral violations, minor moral violations, trust violations and social violations. Respondents reported greater mean reductions in anticipated closeness for social violations committed by singers and television hosts than those committed by actors and athletes. Major moral violations committed by famous athletes resulted in the greatest mean reduction in anticipated closeness. Lower reductions in closeness were reported for moral violations committed by friends compared to media figures. For trust and social violations committed friends and media figures, females reported higher reductions of closeness than males. The implications of these findings for understanding how relationships with media figures compare to social friendships are discussed and suggestions for future are proposed."
2007-0546,"Experience, Rhetoric, Criticism: Reflections on the Potential of Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Communication",Refining Communication Theory,,,,Extended Abstract,"Experience, Rhetoric, Criticism: Reflections on the Potential of Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Communication",Refining Communication Theory,"The alleged proliferation of new modes of communication calls for serious reflection on the philosophical underpinnings of communication. In this paper, I put forward the case for a recovery of some of the philosophical tools provided by two central figures of pragmatism, C.S. Peirce and John Dewey. While Peirce and Dewey are certainly no strangers to communication theory, there are arguably many aspects of their rich philosophies that have not been examined and utilised in this context. I argue that Peirce's rhetoric - which he characterises as ""the highest and most living branch"" of semiotics - and Dewey's philosophy of technology, dubbed ""productive pragmatism"" by Larry Hickman, can be viewed as complementary approaches, outlining a broad conceptual framework of potential value for contemporary research. At the heart of the outlined reconstruction lies Peirce's complex semiotic theory, viewed here as a means for the critique of habits of meaning-production and interpretation, and Dewey's conception of technology, taken as inquiry into the positive role of implements of communication. It is shown that the pragmatists in question are united by an appreciation of the crucial role of cognitive tools, without thereby succumbing into straightforward determinism or base instrumentalism. I also argue that the perspective that emerges from the union of Peirce and Dewey leads to a balanced account of creativity in communication, a path that avoids naïve constructivism as well as sterile objectivism."

In this study we assume that this is different for recipients who are familiar with base-rate information and who know about its diagnostic value. This expertise should neu-tralize the unilateral effect of exemplars on peoples´ quantitative perception of issues in favour of a stronger consideration of base-rate information.

A quasi-experimental survey was conducted in order to compare the influence of exemplars and base-rate information on two different groups of subjects: Those who are acquainted with base-rate information (statistic-experts) and those who arent (statistic-laymen). As expected, only base-rate information influenced the experts´ perception of the issue, while the exemplars remained without effect. By contrast the laymen were only influenced by exemplars but not by base-rate information. Results are discussed with respect to the implications for exemplification theory."

Under high or low conditions of gender salience, men and women sent e-mail to an ostensible male or female recipient. Gender salience was manipulated with emotionality, but not tentativeness, as the attribute that defined the prototype of intergender relations differentiating women and men. Messages were examined for references to emotion and tentative language. As predicted, women referenced emotion more than men when gender was salient, but they used similar levels with low salience. A 3-way interaction of participants sex, participants gender salience and e-mail recipients sex on references to emotion emerged in the predicted form. Tentative language, however, did not vary across any of the conditions, as predicted."

We focus on the process of customization, a learning process in which users adapt e-mail to their own specific individual needs. We use this process to explain 2 negative e-mail effects, information overload and miscommunication, and identify different variables that can influence this customization process, from task characteristics to management interventions. Our theory was tested in a study among ten different organizations, which led to the conclusion that customization of e-mail use leads to miscommunication, and that task related factors and user related factors influence both customization and negative effects. Also, we conclude that management interventions (clear e-mail policy, user training and technical measures) can help prevent customization and its negative effects. Another conclusion is that customization does not lead to more information overload in the organization. If anything, this process leads to less information overload  or, information overload leads to less customization."

Any life, even that of amoeba, consists of a seamless experience of problem finding and problem solving (Popper, 1999). Yet, only humans have the sophistication in using information to solve problems. Hence, understanding better about communicative features in problem solving should lead to a better problem-solving capability in our lives. Although many communication researchers theorized how we use information to solve problems, there is paucity of theories that highlight problem-solving acts based on a general conception of communication behavior. To fill the void, we proposed a conceptual model to describe what common communicative characteristics are observable across different problem situations. We named the model communicant activeness in problem solving (CAPS). To conceptualize, we focused on problem solvers three communicative aspects, information selection, information acquisition, and information transmission during a problem-solving process. We tested the reliability and validity of the new concept in three individual and social issues. Tests showed that CAPS is a reliable and valid construct. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of CAPS in public relations and other communication fields."

As a consequence, categories can be treated by co-participants as an explanation (account) for social action, even in the absence of any explicit account. In the majority of cases, participants treat the use of social categories in this way as an unproblematic aspect of social organization. However, the relatively recent emergence of a set of normative constraints regarding the use of categories such as race, gender and sexuality has made their invocation in describing action a politically fraught matter. In part this is a product of an apparent linkage between the invocation of such categories, and the speakers own embodiment of a category from the same class of categories. For example, a speaker who uses race to account for the actions of another risks having his/her own racial status invoked as an account for having done so, and thus being racially motivated (i.e. racist). In this paper, I examine three practices employed by participants of a race-training workshop to manage the problems posed by invoking race. I conclude by arguing that, even in the process of attempting to resist racial logics in accounting for the actions of others, speakers orient to those logics as a schema by which others will interpret their own actions, and thus reproduce them as a relevant framework for understanding social action (Wieder 1974)."

First, traditional procedures are not culture fair, because they use coding schemes that are subject to cultural observation biases. Second, stimulus material used in cross cultural person perception studies is often incommensurable, because video recordings from different cultures make it impossible to separate effects based on stereotype relevant characteristics of the physical appearance (ethnicity, cultural background, gender, etc.) from those induced by actual behavior. As a solution to these problems the current approach suggests a unified computerized method for the transcription and experimental simulation of nonverbal behavior. By means of a plug-in to character-animation software, movement transcription takes advantage of the interactive animation tools and provides objective data on nonverbal behavior. In subsequent simulation studies, virtual characters are used as neutral surrogates for the human actors to avoid perceptions that result from physical appearance."

The multiple regression results provide confirmation of the original diffusion model by Rogers (1995), whilst also indicate that relative advantage, television watching, Internet using, radio listening, and new media self-efficacy are important antecedents of MOD adoption. This study suggests that the services should be developed to target changes in content and information offerings that are better than existing media. The marketing strategies can emphasize the benefits of the MOD services. Electronic media, such as television, the Internet, and radio, are efficient channels to reach target audiences."

It uses survey questionnaires that were distributed to 112 respondents in four local coffee shops. The findings suggest that the participants are fairly knowledgeable about Thailand and Thai people. Most of them hold positive stereotypes about Thai people such as friendly, civilized, kind, and peaceful. Thailand is most associated with food, beautiful country, and temples. Nonetheless, there are also negative images such as poor, dark skin, prostitution, and sex trade. Also, this study supports contact hypothesis because the respondents who know Thais tend to hold less negative perceptions about the people. The study shows that mass media have little influence on the participants perceptions about the Thais. Most respondents reported they learn about the Thai from other people and by visiting Thai restaurants. This study may help future research concerning Thailand and Thai people to focus more on tourism-related media and Thai restaurants as major influences of the nation's image."

We found that the thoughts from the program could predict attitudes beyond the explicit measures of racial attitudes. Moreover, we observed positive relationships among attitude, involvement, perceived realism and perceived homophily. This indicates thought-listing procedures may be useful for measuring automatic attitudes about race, and that the nature of unprompted racial thoughts is related to viewing related variables."
2007-0559,Exploring Behavioral Consequences of Hostile Media Perception: Its Impact on Advocacy Evaluation and Strategies,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Exploring Behavioral Consequences of Hostile Media Perception: Its Impact on Advocacy Evaluation and Strategies,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,"It has been claimed that communicators perceptions about mass media has significant impacts on their behaviors, because of their presumption about strong media influence. Meanwhile, what the behavioral consequences of such perceptions are and how the perceptions influence communicators have not been empirically explored. Based on theories of hostile media effect (HME), the current study explores how perception of mainstream media coverage influences interest groups advocacy behaviors, i.e., their advocacy strategies. A survey of interest groups revealed that hostile media perception affects interest groups evaluation of their own advocacy efforts. Furthermore, perception of hostile media coverage led them to advocate more aggressive advocacy strategy. The present study suggests that hostile media perception has significant implication on social behaviors. Implications to advocacy practices are also discussed."

2007-0561,Exploring Intermediaries' Perceptions of Public Companies,Public Relations Round Table Session,,,,Paper,Exploring Intermediaries' Perceptions of Public Companies,Public Relations Round Table Session,"The success and the overall value of a corporation are heavily dependent on the financial communitys assessment of that company. Members of the financial community are faced with the challenging task of developing an adequate image or understanding of a company, its state, development and resources. Within the financial community, intermediaries such as journalists and analysts professionally observe, describe and analyze companies. The content produced by intermediaries has a significant impact on how investors perceive companies. Although companies devote a tremendous amount of time and resources to their interaction with investors, their actual control over the content consumed and considered by those investors is very limited. We hold that companies can increase their influence on this content through professional communication to intermediaries on financial markets. Company disclosure can have considerable impact on the perception by intermediaries, if it addresses the intermediaries informational needs and demands. Companies need to gain an understanding about the factors that actually drive their perception by intermediaries. In a comprehensive survey of 66 intermediaries active on the German financial market, we have identified 8 such factor categories. We are convinced that to successfully exert any control over the content consumed by the financial community, corporate communications needs to consistently and concisely address these factors."
2007-0562,Exploring Journalists' Third-Person Perceptions,Media Effects  According to Those Affected: New Evidence on Third-Person Perceptions,,,,Paper,Exploring Journalists' Third-Person Perceptions,Media Effects  According to Those Affected: New Evidence on Third-Person Perceptions,"While journalistic discourse is fraught with references to the social impact of media, our knowledge of how journalists perceive media influence is extremely limited. In order to explore such perceptions, we compared results from a survey of Israeli journalists (n=200) and a survey of a representative sample of the Israeli adult population (n=1,203). Like many other research participants, journalists demonstrated significant third person perceptions, but these were actually smaller than those of the general public. These smaller TPPs stemmed from the fact that while journalists perceived themselves as being personally more influenced than respondents in the public sample, the general perceived influence on the Israeli public was not different from that demonstrated by respondents in the public sample. While journalists did not perceive a larger media impact on the public, they did tend more than the public to perceive that the influence was positive.
In addition, we explored the predictors of larger TPPs among journalists. The professional profile of those perceiving a stronger influence was that of relatively novice journalists, working for local media, but having some formal education in journalism. Finally, results demonstrated that the more journalists perceived the media to have an influence on the public, the more they tended to identify with the norms of factualness and neutrality, and larger TPPs were associated with identification with the norm of balance."

We follow WABA statistical analysis procedures for testing mediating variable proposed by Danserau, Alutto, and Yammarino, (1984).). This procedure involves: First, testing the total deviation scores for each variable are better presented by within cell, or between cell scores known as WABA I. Second, testing on the level of analysis that may underlie relationships among all variables taken two at a time, known as WABA II. Finally, with the combination of WABA I and WABA II, we found that the relationship between LMX, superior-subordinate communication and group commitment, exist on the group level phenomenon. Consequences of this finding were discussed and elaborated."

Will the argument quality and manner of the messages that online opinion leaders write differ from those of other online discussants? In order to answer the questions, this study first identified online opinion leaders in terms of those whose opinions receive popular attentions and positive reactions from other online discussants in a portal-based discussion plaza. A sample of 6,542 online discussants was classified into four groups: online opinion leaders; attention gatherers; quiet persuaders; and the remaining general discussants. It was found that the online opinion leaders are educated, communicatively competent, politically knowledgeable and participatory as compared to other groups. They also wrote higher quality but lower mannered messages than online general public. The findings of this study were discussed in terms of the applicability and validity of the concept of opinion leadership in the Internet environment."

Based upon Fredricksons (2000) broaden-and-build model of positive emotions, this study advances the literature by examining the theoretical role of expressing positive emotions in online support groups for women with breast cancer. Surveys were administered before group access and then 4 months later. The entire body of the text messages written for each subject who participated in online support groups within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) was analyzed using a computerized text analysis program. While expressing positive emotions was not significantly associated with a decrease in breast cancer concerns, we found a significant interaction effect, suggesting expressing positive emotions tempered the detrimental effects of expressing higher levels of negative emotions. Implications for improving psychosocial interventions for this population are discussed."

2007-0567,Exposing Images on the Web: A New Wild Card in Political Discourse,Creating Alternative Channels of Discourse on Iraq,,,,Paper,Exposing Images on the Web: A New Wild Card in Political Discourse,Creating Alternative Channels of Discourse on Iraq,"It has become accepted wisdom that the Internet is the new central arena for political activism. Political blogs alone have drawn so much attention that the daily press and TV news often seem to be looking over their shoulders, uncertain but fearful as to the impact this phenomenon may have for them. The internet has been widely used as an organizing tool by anti-war groups such as MoveOn, TrueMajority, Code Pink, Peace-in-the Precincts, Veterans for Peace, etc. This has now become so common that we have an academic term for it: e-mobilization. New information first appearing in the Internet often drives subsequent coverage by the mainstream media. Commentators and communication scholars seem to agree that the Internet is a potentially powerful new force in political information, association and activity. But the jury is still out on the degree to which the Internet is actually changing how we do politics and how we think about politics (Chadwick, 2006).
An area that has still received little attention in this regard is the increasing proliferation of web sites whose primary purpose is the exhibition of unseen or hard-to-find photographs and video. Often the visual material posted on these sites is meant to expose or reveal embarrassing or funny moments (e.g. the video of Stephen Colberts roasting of the President and the annual White House Press Association dinner), sometimes it is meant to provide otherwise unreported information (e.g. comments by Donald Rumsfeld to reporters after a press conference has officially ended), and sometimes it exposes scandalous activities or events (e.g. the Abu Ghraib digital photographs).
This presentation will introduce examples of a new form of political discourse, the political web video. Web videos are often short video segments, rather than planned and completed films, which address political topics obliquely, often by capturing private performances and unguarded moments, and often through humor. Unlike planned, coherent film and video productions, which present a conscious rhetorical perspective or build a case for a political position (for example the films of Robert Greenwald or Michael Moore), web videos tend to make implicit (albeit often powerful) propositions through satire, unlikely juxtapositions, or their unexpected and surprising appearance. Comparisons will be made to the manipulations of pictorial material on overtly political web sites and the consciously skillful DVD productions of independent documentary videographers discussed by other panel members."

These taboos have been created by misunderstanding, miseducation, and misinterpretation of womens menstruation as shamefulness and unclean, therefore affecting women and mens thinking about menstruation. Advertisements for womens hygiene products are good examples of how these longstanding taboos have been portrayed in cultural context. By analyzing these advertisements, one can see out that this ignorance persists in a more subtle way, reinforcing the negative image of menstruation. This analysis can be especially meaningful when it takes a cross-cultural perspective, because these taboos about menstruation exist in all cultures. The present study conducts a case study of womens hygiene product advertisements through a cross-cultural analysis of TV advertising campaigns of sanitary napkins in the U.S and South Korea."

In the last two years, there have been a number of cases of children and teenagers utilizing web cams -- in conjunction with other internet technologies like PayPal -- as a means of connecting and engaging in commercial sexual exchange with adults. Several high-profile investigative reports have set about exposing teens use of web cams to fuel home-based interactive Internet porn sites. My presentation will consider discourses surrounding these sites -- often run surreptitiously out of minors rooms -- including the uneasy representation of teens as both criminals and victims in exposes in the New York Times and elsewhere. It will also consider the construction of gender in these exposes, which unlike stories of sex trafficking, focus on sites run by both girls and boys."

Three focus group interviews are conducted on February 1st, February 2nd, and February 15th in 2006. A total 40 undergraduate students is participated in the study. One of the main findings is that the mobile phone is a must for college students to keep in contact with family. Other findings suggest that college students use mobile phones to have frequent contact with their family and to fulfill family roles. College students also utilize mobile phones to share experiences and receive emotional and psychological support from their parents."

This literature focuses on integrity and integrity management as means to prevent and combat future scandals. Communication scholars are in a prime position to explore this discourse to reveal the tensions between the motivation to implement integrity and value-laden rhetoric into organizations and the actual discourse of these values statements. There are two parts to this study: (a) the first part uses grounded theory to review relevant management literature as a discursive field, highlighting the tension between an ambiguously defined term that has specific consequences; (b) the second part examines a particular discourse, a universitys statement of integrity, that is used to enhance the organizations image, as a foundation for future persuasive efforts, and does not explicitly define integrity."

This research aimed at examining the reliability of signals of uncertainty within and across communication channels during face-to-face interaction. The research consisted of 2 distinct stages. The conversation study at Stage I investigated peoples daily conversational patterns under uncertainty. It was designed to elicit various kinds and levels of uncertainty so that analysts could observe and capture how people verbally and nonverbally express uncertainty during face-to-face conversation. The signal identification experiment at Stage II involved recognizing the captured uncertainty expressions. Another group of participants viewed and/or listened to the recordings and rated perceived levels of uncertainty levels. The results suggest that there are reliable behavioral clues for degrees of uncertainty and that these clues seem to be present in the nonverbal behavior of people (video only, audio only, audio-video, but not text only). Taken together, this research provides not only empirical evidence of a reliable uncertainty expression, but suggests a framework to study human behaviors under a certain cognitive and/or emotive state."
2007-0574,Facing the Enemy: Emotional Positionings of Photojournalistic Images,Affect in Public Life: Mediating Conflict and Terrorism,,,,Paper,Facing the Enemy: Emotional Positionings of Photojournalistic Images,Affect in Public Life: Mediating Conflict and Terrorism,"As part of a study of the ways in which media operate during war, we analyzed photojournalistic images of ""our"" side and ""their"" side which have appeared in Israeli media during the Israel-Palestine conflict (2000  2005). In contrast to the accepted truism according to which journalists mobilize to support the government in wartime, we discovered an openness (subversive, some might argue) in the ways in which both sides are represented. To use a visual metaphor, coverage has changed from a dichotomous black and white picture of the Intifada in the 1980s to a more varied grayscale in the years since 2000, in which the villain is not exclusively ""evil"" and the ""hero"" is not exclusively ""righteous.""
This kind of representation makes available a broad range of emotional reactions. In addition to the conventional responses of fear, anger and indignation, it allows for feelings of empathy towards the suffering of the other side, and of guilt, shame and anger towards ""our own"" soldiers. In the paper we provide a scheme of affects of ""implied readers"", presented by different images and their verbal framing."

This paper examines the cultural politics of gender and skin color in the persuasive narratives of magazine advertisements for fairness cosmetics and personal care products. We situate advertisings configurations of light-skinned beautys mobility within the hierarchies of race, ethnicity, gender, and caste and the rapid economic growth in the beauty industry in India over the past decade. Analyzing advertisings visual and linguistic fields of meaning, the paper explores the discourses of bodily and personal transformation, modern and traditional science, and heterosexuality and romance that work together in these texts to elevate the superiority of womens light skin color. In conclusion, we outline recent challenges to the cultural idealization of light-skinned feminine beauty and suggest future avenues for research in the arena of gender and epidermal politics in India."

The resulting Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use is the most robust recent example of the best-practices approach to making copyright more flexible, at a time when term extension has vastly increased the power of copyright owners. This presentation features a short film summarizing the process by which they devised such standards, continues with a discussion of the ways in which the marketplace has changed in response, and concludes with a discussion of the significance of the effort as a model in the challenge to adapt copyright to a changing era of expression and media production."

The Caribbean, with an estimated 400,000 cases is second to sub-Saharan Africa in the rate of infection. Several organizations Caribbean-wide have responded through a multisectoral approach to prevention. This qualitative study uses the social influence theory to examine the Jamaican faith-based organizations (FBOs) communication initiatives in HIV/AIDS prevention. Data were gathered through 12 focus group discussions and 30 in-depth interviews data from FBO members, FBO leaders and persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Key findings indicate that FBOs in Jamaica have actively responded to the epidemic through a variety of mass and interpersonal communication strategies. Their efforts are however challenged by myths and misconceptions, HIV/AIDS-related stigma, and socio-cultural factors, and religious beliefs that shape norms, beliefs, attitudes, and risky behaviors. Given their social influence, capacity building through training and empowerment of FBO leaders would enhance their role in HIV/AIDS communication within communities."

Celebrity only exists to the extent fans exist, but fans sometimes become attached to celebrities, and engage in parasocial interaction (i.e., view the celebrity as a 'virtual' presence in their lives). Especially for fans whose entertainment needs are high, and who are therefore likely to seek gratification of primary needs through entertainment, it is predicted that the likelihood of linking a celebrity to higher-order life goals is more likely to occur. For these fans, this linking is likely to reinforce investments in fan activity, which further reinforces the frustration and needs surrounding contact with the celebrity. This cascade of psychological processes is likely to lead to fans' obsession with celebrities, and this in turn will lead to harassment and stalking of celebrities. This study seeks to assess celebrity worship and idolization, entertainment needs, parasocial interaction and media connectedness, and fan activity and harassment. The prediction is that the higher the respondents' celebrity worship, connectedness, and parasocial interaction, the greater their use of fan activities and harassment."

Specifically, Bormanns method of fantasy theme analysis is employed to analyze the fantasy themes and the rhetorical visions embedded in a 26-page blog titled Life and Living in Taiwan and Asia. The analysis reveals 2 primary categories of fantasy themes: (a) one at a personal level revolving around the protagonists  the blogging Canadian expatriate couple, and (b) the other at a historical/political level revolving around the country  Taiwan. The juxtaposition of the 2 categories of fantasy themes reveals 2 parallel yet linked rhetorical visions comprised of dialectical contradictions. Also, the rhetorical strategies identified in the comparison of the 2 categories of fantasy themes are discussed as well. Finally, this study has implications for the functions and the issue of self-representation in blogs."

The candidates largely differed on their approach to the war on terror, with both accusing each other of doing a poor job at protecting the country from another terrorist attack. Previous research shows Republicans to be stronger on issues of national security and foreign policy. Therefore, the manner in that the candidates were framed in terrorism coverage, as beneficial (positive) or costly (negative) to the war on terror, may have differed between Bush and Kerry. At the same time, television is still the most common source of political news. Therefore, this study examined the presentation of terrorism on television news during the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign. In particular, the candidates are evaluated in terms of gain and loss framing in the terrorism coverage, and the candidates fear appeals about terrorism are investigated. Results show that a gain frame in terrorism coverage was used significantly more often for Bush than for Kerry. That is, the positive aspects and benefits of Bush in terrorism coverage were emphasized more often than the positive aspects and benefits of Kerry. This indicates that information presented in terrorism coverage helped Bush more than Kerry. In regard to fear appeals, the candidates did not significantly differ in the proportion of fear appeal statements. However, the frequency of terrorism fear appeals was significantly different, with Bush using significantly more terrorism fear appeals than Kerry."

The model of academic achievement is a male, competitive model that is oppressive to both students and faculty. The academy maintains control and grants status through, for example, the allocation of departmental resources, publishing, tenure and promotion, grades and student evaluations, and the pursuit of and definition of ""intellectual rigor."" The academy is divorced from feminist ideals of nurturance, equality and support. To survive, women often adapt and adopt male methods of competition and communication. In addition, the assumptions, values and ideals embedded within and promoted by the academy -- that is, the ideology of the academy -- are overwhelmingly white and middle- or upper-class, as well as male."

but the numbers of women entering higher levels of professorial rank and
administration continue to rise as well. As feminists, this was central to
our argumentation for many years - if there were more women, there would be
more leaders. How do we measure our own successes? What is leadership in
the academy? We are faced with backlash claims that higher education, and
especially such fields as communication, are being ""feminized."" How does
this reflect on our own work, or the encouragement of women to enter
leadership in the academy? Based on a case study approach, incorporating
ideas of diffusion and political economy, I am interviewing women in
leadership positions to see if there are strategies for survival and/or
satisfaction in the academy that reflect on women's leadership in the

A mental models approach to narrative processing is used to integrate phenomenological experiences like transportation and identification. Three types of untrueness are identified: fictionality, external realism (match with external reality) and narrative realism (coherence of a story). We provide evidence that fictionality does not affect narrative processing. Violations of the 2 types of realism, on the other hand, are seen as inconsistencies among the viewers mental structures as they experience the narrative. These inconsistencies may result in negative online evaluations of a films trueness and cause disruptions in narrative engagement as well as lessen a narratives persuasive power. Finally we articulate a conceptual framework for understanding the roles of fictionality and realism in engagement and disengagement while experiencing filmic narratives."

Efforts to control and disrupt such movements used mass and alternative media as part of a broad-based strategy of opposition to social change spearheaded by the federal government, in conjunction with local police and cooperative private media sources. Exploiting divisions between groups seeking common cause proved an effective technique, as Federal Bureau of Investigation COINTELPRO operations built on a history of communication-oriented action to thwart rising movements, in particular the Black Power surge that saw organizations such as the Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam achieve dramatic gains in a racially charged environment. This study examines the effort to limit the impact of such voices and considers some of the consequences of that campaign of discourse control. While substantial damage was inflected upon Black power organizations, the movements in which they participated spawned considerable cultural and political ferment, much of it inspired by reaction to official abuses."

It uses discourse analysis of stories about the murder, trial, sentencing and related events in news, and an analysis of commentary on the case by journalists involved, to map and discuss the contours of this critical debate about the meaning and mediation of transgender identities. Specifically, I track patterns in gender descriptors, in the naming and framing of Araujos gender identity, and I link these to their sources and locations. I also identify and discuss frames for, and interpretation of, the crime itself over time. I argue overall that public discourse surrounding this murder trial both usefully opened up transgender issues for public debate  largely through the efforts of LGBT advocacy organizations acting as news sources who educated journalists and publics on these issues  but that it also served to close down what should have been a critical element of the debate, that of the legitimacy or possibility of gender fluidity or gender ambiguity. In short, while the news coverage emphasized the pathology of gender violence, it also tended to pathologize  and work to fix, in both senses of the word  the problem of gender fluidity."

Participants played a trivia game with a computer, which they knew generated random answers. Alongside with its answers, the computer delivered either strictly factual feedback (generic comments) or positive comments (flattery) on the participants performance, either in text or in synthetic speech. Although flattery led to more positive overall impressions (i.e., social attractiveness, credibility) and performance evaluations of the computer, such effects were found only in the text condition and among women. Moreover, participants became more suspicious of the validity of the computers claims and were less likely to accept its answers when it produced flattering than generic comments. Male computers elicited greater conformity than female computers, but only among men in the text condition. Results suggest that reduced attention, rather than limited processing resources, fosters mindless reactions to computers that emulate human-like characteristics."

DMA statistically identified critical events (breakpoints) that divided the conversations into distinct time periods, some with many CCs and others with few CCs. Wrong contributions and argumentation processes (correct evaluations of previous speaker's ideas, justifications, and polite disagreements) yielded more CCs. Meanwhile, questions, rude disagreements, and agreements yielded fewer CCs. Students often disagreed with wrong contributions, but used them to build CCs. Unlike CCs or correct ideas, correct evaluations yielded more CCs for 3 turns. Correct evaluations also yielded more correct evaluations, justifications, and agreements, and fewer wrong contributions. Justifications yielded more justifications and fewer rude disagreements. Justifications yielded more CCs and questions received satisfactory explanations more often in successful groups than in unsuccessful groups. Applied to practice, teachers can encourage students to express and justify their own ideas (even wrong ideas) while evaluating others' ideas carefully and politely."

The sample contains 1,638 hours of content aired on a total of 13 broadcast and cable networks viewed most often by children 2-17 years old. Non-programming content was weighted by the viewing patterns of 2-7, 8-12, and 13-17 year olds. A total of 56,236 non-programming elements were coded, of which 40,152 were ads. Extensive analyses, including primary persuasive appeals and the use of any health appeals, were run on the 8,854 food ads. Children encounter roughly 2.5 minutes of food ads for every hour of television they watch. Because they watch more television, children 8-12 are likely to see more food ads than children 2-7 or those 13-17. Over a single year, 8-12 year olds are likely to see over 7,500 food ads that, if run back to back, would cover over 50 hours. Most of the ads all children see are for foods that nutritionists, watchdog groups, and relevant government organizations (e.g., the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services) argue should be consumed in moderation and/or in small portions."

A content analysis of food advertising was conducted in the spring of 2006 on programming from broadcast and cable networks most likely to be viewed by children. The results reveal modest improvement in information concerning nutrition as compared to previous content analyses of food advertising (e.g., Kunkel & Gantz, 1992; Harrison & Markse, 2005). However, as in past research, unhealthy foods are most frequently advertised. Further, commercials targeted toward children employ production techniques and persuasive appeals that make it difficult for children to critically evaluate advertising. The potential impacts of this advertising landscape are discussed on both the individual and social level."

In 2005, major advertisers (including Kraft, General Mills, and Kelloggs) announced new advertising policies designed to combat childhood obesity. In part, the proposed changes were intended to cut childrens exposure to ads for unhealthy foods. Collectively, the policies restricted or eliminated child-targeted advertisements for products that exceeded specific levels of calories, fat, sugar, or processed grains per serving. However, limits on these policies suggested that the overall landscape of food ads viewed by children would not change significantly. A content analysis was conducted on television food advertisements aired just before and one year after these announcements. The advertisements were coded for product type, persuasive appeals, production techniques, and the presence of child models. The results indicated no significant changes in the food advertising landscape confronting child viewers. We discuss the implications of these findings for advertisers, government regulators, and health officials."

Television food advertising is a known contributor to this problem but little research has examined newer marketing venues such as the Internet. Accordingly, a content analysis of online food marketing practices was conducted for four popular childrens websites: CartoonNetwork.com, Nick.com, Neopets.com, and Candystand.com. Consistent with patterns in television advertising, results indicate that the food products marketed online are high in calories and low in nutrients. Candy, sweetened breakfast cereals, snacks, and quick serve restaurants dominated. Candystand.com, a food-based website, exhibited the greatest amount of food marketing. The types of marketing appeals used to promote these foods ranged from clearly delineated advertisements, to more immersive marketing techniques such as product placements, advergames, and integrated marketing pages. Common to all marketing appeals was the use of attention-getting features, such as dynamic images, bold/colorful text, and animation, as well as child-directed branded characters. Because the foods marketed online are not consistent with a healthy diet, it is recommended that additional steps be taken to regulate online marketing practices."

The contradiction, inherent in the situation is that a national crisis calls for mobilizing to solidarity rather than for conducting public deliberation. But in the new global and technological media environment disagreements and internal criticisms over policy crack the united front, making total mobilization by media no longer an option.
In the context of today's media scene we look at the Lebanon War in order to observe the management of new type of patriotism-cum-deliberative democracy on Israeli media. We chose to focus on media's discursive strategies employed in talking to the public, about the public and by hosting representatives on screen.
We noticed a dramatic transformation in the way media portrayed the Israeli public. At the first stage of war the common belief the Israeli homefront's as soft spoilt, and spineless brought about a strategy of pouring compliments on the steadfastness revealed by the hinterland. However, as the war continued, dissonant voices emerged, claiming that both the army and the state have failed to provide the hinterland with the resources needed for preserving the image."

Through this initiative, CCP used findings from their qualitative research to design and implement interventions directly targeting the low knowledge of target groups as they related to poultry and human symptoms of AI, hesitancy to practice caging, proper handwashing and food preparation, and lack of perceived control. These findings were used to emphasize the collective behavior change approach and inform CBAICs message strategy. The theoretical basis for the campaign is that AI prevention is best addressed through collective self-efficacy and not through individual behavior change. This positioning reflects the campaigns Tanggap Flu Burung (Get a Grip on Avian Flu) slogan. It suggests an efficacy framework that works at multiple levels: avian flu-free households, communities and work places and engages multiple stakeholders such as the media, government policy makers, corporations, the religious groups and civil society organizations."

For instance, Niesyto et al. (2003) assert that, Through media, young people may be able to detach themselves from the constraints of their immediate social situations and establish contact with global youth cultures. Yet, this research reveals that young people are creatively using online sites such as YouTube and Google video to concretize local relationships. Based on an ethnographic study that focuses on video production, sharing, and reception among children and youth, this paper explores how young people use video to foster and enrich interactions with co-located friends and classmates. The study explores how they semiotically transmit messages within and through videos that create intimate online social spaces while excluding remote participants from casually accessing or understanding their privately-created yet publicly displayed video-mediated experiences.

2007-0597,Four Phases of Medialization: An Analysis of the Medialization of Politics,Reconsidering the Media-Society Nexus: The Mediatization of Society  the Mediation of Meaning,,,,Paper,Four Phases of Medialization: An Analysis of the Medialization of Politics,Reconsidering the Media-Society Nexus: The Mediatization of Society  the Mediation of Meaning,"It is a well-know fact that politics in postindustrial societies is mediated, in the sense that the media mediate between political actors and the citizenry. However, the concept of mediated politics is rather static, and it thus fails to capture the dynamics of political communication of today and how it has evolved over the last decades. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the processes through which politics increasingly has become mediatized or medialized. The paper will argue that this is a process where it is possible to make a distinction between four different phases of medialization. Each of these phases will be discussed and analyzed. The paper will argue that as politics becomes increasingly medialized, the important question no longer is related to the independence of the media from politics and society. The important question becomes the independence of politics and society from the media."
2007-0598,Fragmenting Citizenship,Communication and Sovereignty: Dislocations and Relocations,,,,Paper,Fragmenting Citizenship,Communication and Sovereignty: Dislocations and Relocations,"The global media networks, and to an even greater extent access to the internet, have fractured national public spheres, introducing not just global information, but new types of citizens. Metaphors dominate debate about the impact and globalization of the media. From McLuhan's 'global village' through Castells' 'networked society,' versions of a Habermasian 'global' public sphere to 'cyberdemocracy,' the underlying images are locational and presuppose a collocated group of citizens as the focus of democratic citizenship.

In the first case media have caused the world to contract into a village with the village green as the model of a communicative space, in the second case the world is laid out as a grid of points which can communicate with each other; in the third, the media have globalized the space of debate and finally, cyberdemocracy assimilates the nation state to cyberspace, and online participation to democratic choice in a nation state. These metaphors are powerful, yet with their suggestion of a unique mediated space constituted by Cartesian cogitos with rights defined in terms of US neo-liberal democracy, the dominant metaphors leave little room for the way fragmentation of the media and the entry of new media have led to a proliferation of local public spheres and new modes of participation."
2007-0599,Frame Analysis of Mediated Interpersonal Communication,Towards a Concept of Mediated Interpersonal Communication: Regarding the Cell Phone as a Hybrid Medium,,,,Paper,Frame Analysis of Mediated Interpersonal Communication,Towards a Concept of Mediated Interpersonal Communication: Regarding the Cell Phone as a Hybrid Medium,"This proposal deals with frame and cultural aspects in which human interaction takes place. Interpersonal communication has always been a part of the public sphere although it changed in some aspects; e.g. in former times the private ballast (at this one should be reminded of the coffee houses during the 18th century) was kept out of the public sphere. Today one could observe nearly the opposite way around. More and more private topics reach the public sphere and led to a new appraisal of the boundaries of the pair of contrast private and public. It seems that some media such as the cell phone advanced this process. The observation data which was gained in Spain (2004) and in Germany (2006) demonstrate that the cell phone usage has special effects on the public sphere and produce new communicative arrangements. This hybrid medium allows describing and analyzing a process that is taking place at the moment: a new justification of the boundaries of the ambit of public and private close to an increasing privatization of the public sphere. The mentioned process has bearings on the media frames and the definition of these frames (Goffman, Höflich). To give an example: a person who is called can be engaged in a face to face communication at the same time. That means the person has to act in two media frames and normally the telephone call will be his main engagement (Goffman) and the face to face conversation will be interrupted for the period of the call. These new impacts require new rules and modifications of the media frame. Within this proposal different mobile communication situations and their requirements (Behavior Setting; Barker) will be analyzed using the data from the observations and media diaries.

In addition cultural peculiarities of mobile media use will be identified. Every culture shows different ways of using a medium like the cell phone. These types of media usage are a result of varying life styles and should be considered while analyzing the observation data of the cell phone use and changing media situations in general. Observations from Germany, Italy and Spain will help to demonstrate that even in countries which are relatively close to each other cultural aspects can be figured out. Finally the proposal will resume the new aspects arisen from the analysis of the cell phone use and integrate them in the theoretical concept of mediated interpersonal communication."

In a comparative context, this paper investigates coverage of Beslan in The New York Times and in The Moscow Times. Analysis of the news frames revealed striking similarities and fewer differences.

Although newspaper editorials have the opportunity to question, criticize, and suggest alternative opinions to official policy, during times of uncertainty and war, newspaper editorials do not often challenge authority. Because the leaders of the two strongest prowar nations, U.S. President George W. Bush and U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, were often personally blamed by war critics and hailed by war supporters, this study sought to understand how influential newspaper editorials framed the two leaders. This study content analyzed top U.S. and U.K. newspaper editorials in the months before and during the Iraq war. Results show that Bush was covered more negatively than Blair; Bush was more often associated with the problems of the war; and Bush and Blair were used in editorials that framed the war as a battle between individual leaders rather than a battle of societal proportions. Findings also support previous research that shows editorial comment on foreign policy is often reactionary."
2007-0602,Framing Controversy on Al-Jazeera: From Cartoon Wars to the Pope,News Framing and International Conflicts: Contexts and Impacts,,,,Paper,Framing Controversy on Al-Jazeera: From Cartoon Wars to the Pope,News Framing and International Conflicts: Contexts and Impacts,"Previous research on Al-Jazeeras Arabic-language reporting on the issue of the veil in France in 2003-04, and the riots in France in 2005, shows that these issues have been framed in the context of conflict between the Arab-Islamic world and the West (Cherribi 2006). This study of Al-Jazeeras approach to reporting on the controversial Danish cartoons in 2006 and the controversial comments of the Pope later that year, focuses on how these controversies surfaced on the news and were developed by the channels leading political and religious commentators in news and current affairs programs. Three months after the cartoons of the Prophet appeared in a Danish newspaper, there were no signs of massive protest on the Arab street. But once Al-Jazeera started to actively report on this issue, it became a movement that went beyond the Arab street to enrage the entire Muslim world. Al-Jazeeras coverage drove a media frenzy against Denmark and put the cartoons controversy high on the public agenda, arousing the Arab street and promoting the boycott of Danish products in many countries around the world. It then became the most important issue on the agenda for discussion at meetings of the Arab League and at the Conference of the Islamic States. Some months later, when the Pope spoke on Islam in history, Al-Jazeeras reporting framed the story to be interpreted in only one waythat the Pope showed no respect for Arabs, Muslims, and Arab Islamic civilizations. The story was framed as part of a larger American Christian Zionist conspiracy against Islam and the Arab world. In contrast to the reporting on these issues in Al-Jazeera, the reporting on the competing channel Al-Arabiya was less inflammatory. In this paper, I discuss the news on both Arabic-language satellite channels on these issues, and illustrate through these case studies the important autonomous role these media have in framing international conflict and driving an international news agenda kin the Arabic-speaking world. I also comment on the launch of the English-language Al-Jazeera and discuss how it differs from Arabic-language Al-Jazeera."

The paper concludes with a discussion of the power of the media to influence public perceptions of European issues, in a growing European Union."

The MPAAs participation at these hearings can be understood within two frameworks: that the MPAA creates myths and rationales to justify dominance over others; and that the MPAA represents an empathic citizenry, serving to stimulate what it perceives as successful governance. Furthermore, the organizations message consistency over the past thirty years has strengthened its framing of copyright and piracy issues within these two frameworks. This consistency has also reinforced the MPAAs position as policy expert in Congressional hearings pertaining to these issues."

The purpose of this study is to put forward a desirable model of news patterns in dealing with biotechnological matters. The results show that new modes of news coverage emerged especially in regards to editorial sections, themes, and complexities. Firstly regarding editorial sections, biotechnological news were increasingly placed in social and international sections, eroding its predominance in science and technology sections. Secondly, in terms of themes, newspapers started to shed light on the aspect of the birth of new life, compared with their earlier focuses on medical treatment of disease. Finally, complexities of news were characterized by explanations of biotechnological development when research performance reached its peak."

And what can be learned about the metaphoricity of concepts, and their impact upon analytical discourse, from the use of images and visual tropes in communication studies? Focusing on the place of the visual within the theoretical discourse of political communication research, this paper examines two interrelated concepts - Lippmanns picturing and the ubiquitous framing - attempting to shed light on their conceptual proclivities by giving an account of them in relation to the 'pictorial turn' in the humanities and social sciences."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether depictions of athletes mirrored the reality of the games or reinforced misconceptions of sexual difference. This study explored the cultural values embedded in sports as seen through the media lens. It revealed the ongoing struggle between media representations of men and women and reality. This was accomplished by investigating how women and men are visually portrayed in newspaper coverage of the Olympics. Characterizations of female athletes supported previous studies that found sexual differences were emphasized through stereotypical gender representations of participation and activity level. The findings showed no bias in quantitative representation or prominence of photographs.

In order to study how different frames emerged in the news coverage, the study includes all news articles published in the selected newspapers during a six-month period from the first publication of the Mohammad cartoons. Methodologically, the study uses quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Theoretically, the study is based on news framing, frame building and international news determinants."

This study analyzes this discussion about freedom of speech in 3 German newspapers. It concentrates on the thematic focus of discourse content and its fluctuations in the course of time. Thereby, 5 argumentation patterns are identified: Articles approving limitations of freedom of speech or disapproving them (religious limitations play a major role in these 2 clusters), articles concentrating on censorship, articles concentrating on other endangerments of freedom of speech, and articles discussing the general necessity for safeguarding freedom of speech. Furthermore, the viewpoint of the media, which do not only report on the discussion but are affected by it themselves, is analyzed. The media use editorial pages to express their disapproval about limiting their freedom. Reasons for freedom of speech and its advantages hardly occur in the German media."

This paper illustrates how the cartoon crisis can be characterized as an example of successful political spin and a re-politicization of the Danish press, where newspapers increasingly are becoming political actors and where political spin and the journalistic field are closely interlinked and dependent on each other. In Jyllands-Posten, the text accompanying the 12 cartoons explained broadly Muslim demands for special status within modern society incompatible with Danish secular democracy. The purpose of Jyllands-Postens initiative was, according to its own words, to insult, mock and ridicule Muslims in Denmark. When Muslims and others across Denmark protested against the publication of the cartoons and the general tone of the debate on ethnic minorities in Denmark, Jyllands-Posten responded by emphasizing the sacredness of freedom of speech and the value of not backing down in compromise. The original story regarding the possible self-censorship of cartoonists shifts into stories about the struggle between us (Danes) and them (Muslims). They are portrayed in this framing as a threat towards Danish freedom of speech  a freedom that is presented as the core foundation for all other freedoms. Hence being Muslim is in opposition to freedom and to being Danish."

With the rise of cable/satellite radio and television and the internet, terrestrial broadcast radio and television are at a distinct disadvantage. This is especially true considering the more robust fining scheme impossed in the wake of nipplegate. The two main pillars for denying full first amendment protection have been invasiveness and scarcity. That is, the indiscriminate nature of over the air broadcasting combined with undiscriminating radio and television receivers and the limited amount of public spectrum space available. The proposed replacement of analog with digital broadcasting throws the sustainability of these pillars into question. Using the proposed In-Band-on-Channel Digital Audio Broadcasting for radio scheme as an example, I explore the possible impacts of vastly increased frequency space and smart receivers on the media case law that restricts over-the-air content."

New Perspectives on Motivations to Play Video Games,"Despite the popularity of thousands of free games that are offered on the Internet, communication researchers thus far paid little research attention to this phenomenon. The present study attempted to fill this void in research. By means of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, we investigated 4th through 6th graders (N = 343) uses, gratifications, and opinions related to free online games and we investigated gender differences in free online game play. Results showed that the gratifications that children derive from free online games differ from the gratifications that were reported in video game studies. In addition, contrary to what has been found in video game research--boys and girls did not differ very much in their amount of free online game play. However, their motives for playing such games and their choice of games did vary."
2007-0614,From Belief-Importance to Intention: The Impact of Framing on Technology Adoption,Mobile Communication Adoption,,,,Paper,From Belief-Importance to Intention: The Impact of Framing on Technology Adoption,Mobile Communication Adoption,"A large body of research in decision sciences, marketing, and political communication has demonstrated the influence of frames, or how small changes in content significantly impact social judgment and behavior. The current research integrates and extends these notions to the study of innovation-diffusion and longitudinally explores the influence of frames on the formation of beliefs about an innovation. Frames reflecting a new note-taking softwares attributes were developed based of the Unified Theory of Technology Adoption and tested within a randomized experiment. Results revealed a significant and unique framing effect. Consistent with research in the political sciences, frames influenced the psychological importance attached by adopters to specific attributes or beliefs about the technology rather than their generalized beliefs about technology. These salient beliefs, in turn, shaped the individuals expectations from technology and influenced their decision to adopt it. Interestingly, based on the type of frame, subsequent experience with the technology did not completely eliminate the framing effect, but rather experience seemed to only erode it. The results suggest the possibility of using small changes in content to significantly alter the meaning attributed to a technology and powerfully influence its rate of adoption over time."

Now, ten years later, voters in Michigan are poised to decide the fate of a copycat measure, the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative (MCRI) in the coming elections. This essay offers a comparative analysis of the CCRI and MCRI campaigns, exploring how appeals both for and against affirmative action have shifted over this ten-year span. Our analysis reveals important breaks as well as echoes from California to Michigan. We trace how diversity, individualism, and fairness operate as interlocking yet conflicting discursive categories, how race and racial taxonomies retain an abiding significance even in the current post-soul era, and finally, how it is in these contests over race and racial governance that a series of crises and paradoxes of the neoliberal state get worked out."

In doing so, the Internet potentially allows for more inclusion and participation in the public debate. This paper examines (by means of discourse analysis) what happens when an alternative voice enters an online discussion and analyses the interactions that take place between disagreeing participants. The discussions analysed deal with the issue of immigration, a contested topic in the Netherlands. The study shows that even though the Internet may allow for alternative voices to enter public debate, these voices are not readily included and taken into account. Rather, participants try to eliminate the alternative voice. However, some types of expressions, such as greetings, narratives and testimonials seem to be able to open up debate and enable meaningful interaction between different discourses."
2007-0617,"From ""Dawson's Creek"" to ""Dawson's Desktop"": TV-Web Synergy in a Multimedia World",(Dis)connecting Communities,,,,Paper,"From ""Dawson's Creek"" to ""Dawson's Desktop"": TV-Web Synergy in a Multimedia World",(Dis)connecting Communities,"This essay reviews the changing nature of the youth media environment. In particular, it examines the developing synergy between youth-oriented television programs and their corresponding Web sites as well as the flow of content from one media format to another. It overviews various types of program Web sites and presents three functions served by such sites  information, interactivity, and investment. The paper offers specific examples of sites that represent these functions, and discusses how they may change young peoples engagement with both television programs and the Web. The essay also considers the role of show Web sites in the development of fans and fan communities, as well as the (lack of) possibility for teen fans to interact with the producers of youth programs through these Web sites. Finally, this paper presents one example of an online fan community, Buffy the Vampire Slayers The Bronze, in which fans and show producers do interact."
2007-0618,"From ""Effects"" to ""Culture"" in the Study of Political-Entertainment Television",Methodological Challenges in the Study of Hybrid Political-Entertainment Television,,,,Paper,"From ""Effects"" to ""Culture"" in the Study of Political-Entertainment Television",Methodological Challenges in the Study of Hybrid Political-Entertainment Television,"Much scholarship focused on new forms of entertainment-centered political communication relies on traditional behavioral models of social science to measure the political effects on audiences. These measures, however, offer limited means for understanding the ways in which popular culture impacts politics in general, and political culture in particular. While behavioral approaches to communication are instrumental, focusing on what communicative acts ultimately do for the state, we must also recognize the integrative aspects of communicationexamining what media content does for users. This paper advocates a set of integrative, cultural methodologies that account for the role new political media play in citizens daily political meaning-making and seek to understand the larger effects on civic culture. It examines the ways in which historical, industrial, literary and rhetorical, ideological, and reception analyses provide alternative means for examining the broader implications of new forms of political communication for civic culture, as opposed to the continued insistence on examining the micro-processes of particular forms of political behavior."
2007-0619,From Failure to Fiasco: Media and Misrepresentation in Iraq,News Framing and International Conflicts: Contexts and Impacts,,,,Paper,From Failure to Fiasco: Media and Misrepresentation in Iraq,News Framing and International Conflicts: Contexts and Impacts,"Though many indicators suggested majority opposition to the Iraq war by mid 2004, public opinion did not change much between then and mid 2006, despite mounting evidence that Iraq was turning from failure to fiasco. Partially as a result of opinion stasis, US policy was to stay the course even as the wars cost-benefit ratio approached infinity (that is, massive costs and imperceptible benefits). Why did this occur, and what are the implications for theories of media and foreign policy? Our focus is on the medias apparent inability to construct a narrative of strategic failure. Instead the media system as a whole provided fragmented coverage of unconnected tactical breakdowns, symptoms of serious shortcoming but no explicit diagnosis. Interspersed with these unconnected dots were a series of high-visibility media events constructed to convey light at the end of a reasonably short tunnel. Thus the US experienced misrepresentation in three dimensions: by government of majority opinion, by government of U.S. national interests, and by media of government policy. In light of the growing consensus spanning the elite spectrum from William F. Buckley and George Will to Hendrik Hertzberg and Katrina Vandenheuvel, and including by 2005 virtually the entire foreign policy intelligentsia, all clamoring for strategic change, it might be hypothesized that the medias failures trumped both majority opinion and elite consensus (with the important exception of Congress, which remained variously silent, obliquely critical, and obsequiously supportive). This suggests an important autonomous role for media in the making of foreign policy, and specifically in the creation and exacerbation of international conflict, that demands far more scholarly attention than it has received. The paper assesses media treatment of both quantitative indicators of policy failure (US and civilian casualties) and less quantifiable but potentially vivid evidence that Americas strategic objectives were not beingand could not beachieved."

Intercultural Issues in News Coverage",,,,Paper,"From Gospel to News: Evangelicalism and Secularization of Protestant Missionary Press in China, 1870s-1900s","""Fair & Balanced?"" Intercultural Issues in News Coverage","This study examines the social context of the secularization of the Protestant missionary press in China and its impact on early Chinese modernizers from the 1870s to the 1900s. In the process of this cross-cultural evangelical communication, liberal and conservative missionaries were divided on to what extent Christianity should be localized and whether to include secular knowledge in a missionary newspaper. The Chinese elite, on the other hand, eagerly adopted the liberal missionaries rationalization of journalism as a powerful means of enlightening the masses and leading public opinion in the national modernization. Tracing the significant legacy of the Protestant missionary press in Chinas history through a case study of Young Allens Globe Magazine, this study argues that the missionary press of the late nineteenth century established a political paradigm for the Chinese press. Through their pioneering work, the missionary press trained the first generation of Chinese editors, developed printing and distribution methods, exhibited the idea of specialized periodicals, and thus provided a foundation for the rise of the Chinese indigenous press at the end of the nineteenth century."
2007-0621,From Hostile Terrain: Internet News Users as a Virtual Public,Discussion & Disagreement,,,,Paper,From Hostile Terrain: Internet News Users as a Virtual Public,Discussion & Disagreement,"Widespread access to the Internet now provides American voters with a new and vibrant source for political news and discussion. For those who live in geopolitical regions were they are in the political minority, the Internet provides a unique avenue to a host of newly decentralized, loosely affiliated ideological networks of information, action and support. In this paper, I propose and begin to test for a hostile geography effect. Three sets of hypotheses propose that supporting the losing party at the county, congressional district, and state levels will be positively related to use of the Internet for news- and opinion-seeking. Only one significant relationship is found  a negative relationship between county-level hostility and news-seeking  but relationships involving the relative competitiveness of states to Internet use are examined and possible explanations, such as the spiral of silence effect, are explored."

This project examines constructions of whiteness in youth culture, considering more specifically how whiteness is represented in the MTV reality shows Jackass, Viva La Bam, and Wildboyz. These series constitute a body of programming addressing adolescent white males via a comedy of bodily injury, copious pranking, and flippant mockery of adults, indigenous peoples, peers, and the self. Analyzing the series irreverent mode of address, I consider how these programs make white masculinity hyper-visible while constructing a distinctive culture of never-ending adolescence that both destabilizes and secures white masculine power."

Since Daniel Goleman initially popularized emotional intelligence (EI), it has spread out of education into a number of different disciplines and practices. This paper tracks back to the little-known business origins of that strand of EI and its relation to outstanding leaders in organisations. It examines how it, and subsequent EI research in workplaces, are implemented. It also explores the disciplinary beginnings of allied research in key relevant fields such as cognitive neuroscience, and how it has been applied in consultancy situations. It ends by pulling together the findings from these diverse fields to set out a program for the application of emotional intelligence to the theory and practice of public relations."

To remain relevant to the to Chinese, Indian, and Malay readers in Singapore the content and the advertising in this magazine would have reflected the trends of the times. Thus, a historical analysis of the content of advertising images in Her World over forty years should tells us a great deal about how Asian women of various races have seen themselves reflected in the pages of a popular Asian womens magazine. The findings suggest that while Her World originally featured women of diverse races in the advertising, over time, it has come to mainly feature one, homogeneous type of model: the Caucasian woman."

Based on two case studies - the ""Wake Up Wal-Mart"" and ""Wal-Mart Watch"" campaigns - I argue for the evolution of the traditional corporate campaign.

I will begin by reviewing themes about girlhood that are receiving popular attention and fueling moral panics; panics about girls as socially aggressive and sexually degraded. My purpose is to then consider the implications of anti-feminist discourses for Girls Studies scholars and researchers. Locating these issues within our current research (Currie, Kelly and Pomerantz), I will discuss: the importance of reflexivity in research with girls, how to listen to girls in ways that honor their voices, and how to challenge moral panics about girls behavior through an understanding of girls agency and their empowerment.

Dawn H. Currie is Professor of Sociology at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver). She is past Chair of the undergraduate Womens Studies Programme. Dawn has published a number of articles (many with Deirdre Kelly and Shauna Pomerantz) about girls, girlhood and feminist research. She is author of Girl Talk: Adolescent Magazines and Their Readers and is currently working on a book (Peter Lang, forthcoming) with Kelly and Pomerantz concerning girl powerwhat it means in popular discourse but, more importantly, what it means to girls themselves. Dr. Currie teaches research methodology and feminist theory at UBC and also works with researchers in Vietnam on development issues."

This is disheartening given the tumult and anxiety that frequently surrounds coming out conversations for both the person coming out and the person(s) receiving the disclosure. It also speaks to the larger issue of communication inquiry often failing to challenge, expand, or refine practical theory developed in other disciplines. This study seeks to offer a practical communicative theory of coming out. By doing so, it illustrates how theory from noncommunicative fields can be transformed through a communication lens; develops a practical theory of coming out transactions; and explores the potential impact for this theory both inside and outside of the field of communication. Employing 196 narratives from 101 research participants, a grounded theory of coming out is offered suggesting 7 distinct coming out typologies and 4 general steps occurring in coming out conversations. The implications of these findings toward developing a nonlinear theory of coming out as well as larger questions of theoretical development in and out of the communication discipline are explored."

This essay seeks to explore the expansion of televisions norms and constraints through an extended discussion regarding the possibilities of HBO being something other than TV. This will be done through an exploration of sexuality, violence, and profanity and how each of these acts as a cultural marker within HBOs brand identity. By examining the dirty underbelly of the tube of plenty, this paper will examine the past, present, and future of pay television, concluding with a discussion of the syndication and reediting of HBOs original programming and what the regulation of cable may mean for a channel that has used explicit content as a way to position itself outside televisual normativity."

Promoting values of western modernity, consumerism, and moral ethics uncommon in the region, these products posed major threats to conservative groups in these countries. In post-colonial Lebanon, and in absence of true leadership to face these cultural threats, religious extremism surged as a consequence in an attempt to ward off foreign influences. Lebanons internal turmoil that culminated in a fifteen-year civil war allowed for the perfect conditions for the rise of religious extremist groups. Most notable of these groups is Hizbollah (The Party of God), a Shiite fundamentalist party funded by Iran. Soon after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the early 1980s, Hizbollah emerged with goals of instituting an Islamist state in Lebanon, ending the Israeli occupation, and resisting any ideological and socio-political influences from the west. Almost a decade after its inception, Hizbollah discovered the power of media. The party launched Al-Manar television to promote its ideological and military goals. This paper investigates the conditions that allowed for religious fundamentalism to gain a strong position in Lebanon. Applying theories of globalization, post-colonialism, and cultural hegemony, this paper studies the rise of Hizbollah and the creation of Al-Manar as an alternative medium. Finally, by studying its structure and production practices as well as its coverage in Arab and Muslim countries, this paper looks at the tools that Al-Manar employs to serve Hizbollahs ideology and to reach its target audience."

New Shanghai  a city of excess, commerce, speed and stature  competes to become the information communication hub in the Asia-Pacific. The World Expo of 2010 in the city will furthermore be a spectacular event for fulfilling aspirations of becoming a world city, and even a world centre. Partly through the display of wide-ranging digitalization, at the exposition and in the city, the municipal government has set its mind on once again detaining the future right here. In this paper I sound out space and media theorists as well as phenomenological philosophical thinking about the future, in order to probe the question of how one place becomes continually endowed with futurity. Futurity, I argue, is in fact an essential part of a collective memory in the city. It is Shanghais genius loci. Moving from the Golden Age of modernity and cosmopolitanism of the 1920s and 30s, through the city under Communism, into the current global/digital city of Shanghai I inquire into they ways in which media and communication  the technological imaginary, mediations of the Shanghai illusion and the factual media and/or mass cultural forms intrinsic to the urban fabric  have been historically, and are at present, a backbone of the Shanghai imaginary. I further discuss how the future is both obsessively desired in Shanghai of today and at once under seizure since New Shanghai is, as much as it is a place of physical monumentality, an elusive and contradictory space of temporal co-existence as well as of hypermobility and hypermediation."

A content analysis of the top 150 games in 2005 from across all platforms will focus on several key issues. Although most of the research on video game content to date has focused on violence, other areas that have received extensive empirical attention in popular media have been ignored in video game research. This paper addresses the gap in the literature by exploring the portrayals of mental illness, profanity, sexuality and body imagery."

Successful video games sell more than five million units, grossing hundreds of millions US $ in the US market alone. The appeal of videogames is no longer restricted to young, male audiences. Academic research based on approaches from entertainment research and a uses and gratification perspective have been successfully employed to analyse the fascination of videogame playing. However, these approaches do not fully answer the question of what makes a videogame succeed in the market. Therefore an empirical analysis of the market data for the most successful video games in the US market was carried out (N = 201). This research was based on models in the movie market but account for the specific qualities of videogames. 3 complexes of independent variables were found to be relevant for the analysis of the video game market: game play related game inherent and marketing, and platform based factors."

Analyses of news releases disseminated to the media and the media content show that the newsworthiness of news releases is a strong predictor of the selection of news releases for use as well as the amount of coverage the selected news releases received; however, the newsworthiness of news releases fail to predict the prominence of coverage of the selected news releases. Journalists predisposition to mistrust public relations-generated information as well as their preference for journalistic autonomy may account for the lack of relationship between the newsworthiness of news releases and their prominent coverage. Implications of these findings for the practice of public relations are discussed."

These studies fall short because researchers assume knowledge is created through exposure to a CSR message without measuring it. The purpose of this study is to assess participants knowledge of CSR activities and the impact of knowledge on both attitude and purchase intention. Results indicate that participants exposed to CSR campaigns are more knowledgeable about those campaigns. The study also found that increased knowledge of a companys CSR campaign increases positive attitudes toward the company but it also creates a backlash. Participants exposed to a companys CSR campaign indicated they were less likely to purchase the companys products. Finally, the study also looked at the impact of self- and response efficacy on consumers attitudes and purchase intentions toward companies that practice CSR. Previous research (Mohr et al., 2001) indicated consumers may lack self- and response efficacy in this context. Results indicated no support for these hypotheses."

However, the mainstream media has painted a picture of MySpace as a place where adolescent girls post scantily clad photos of themselves and where sexual predators constantly lurk -- and according the critical content analysis performed in this piece, the two are often subtly and troublingly linked. This plays into the hegemonic discourses of femininity and masculinity and constructs adolescent girls as sexualized victims and often blames the technology instead of the sexual predators who are drawn to them."
2007-0638,Gender Differences in Empathy: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,The Significance of Cultural Backgrounds in Reception of TV Programs,,,,Paper,Gender Differences in Empathy: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,The Significance of Cultural Backgrounds in Reception of TV Programs,"Large-scale studies often yield data that speak to important ancillary issues too. For example, consider a cross-cultural comparison of empathy, using data drawn from the humor study reported in this symposium. The humor study measured empathy to examine the role it might play in childrens reactions to humor (e.g., slapstick). However, these data also provided insight into the development of empathy itself. Prior studies on empathy had not identified the ages at which gender differences emerge, and most were limited to one culture.
Participants were 485 7- to 11-year-olds from the USA, Northern Ireland, The Republic of Ireland, Israel (including Jewish and Arab children), Germany, and South Africa. Participants completed an Empathy Scale, in which they rated descriptive statements as not like me, sort of like me, or really like me.
As expected, girls showed higher levels of empathy than boys overall (p < .001). In addition, a striking similarity appeared across cultures: Gender differences emerged around age 10 in all cultures except South Africa (p < .01). This age is consistent with the emergence of other gender differences in the USA (e.g., self-esteem, performance in math and science). Results are discussed in relation to the development of gender roles in preadolescence across cultures. We also use this example to illustrate the value of mining ancillary data from existing studies to explore other important phenomena."

We reported those findings at the ICA conference in Dresden. In one predominantly male focus group, the participants argued that they did not believe gender was an issue for staff, but that it was a concern for them when teaching students. Participants highlighted were three main issues of concern: 1) many students of either gender appear nervous about labelling themselves as feminist, 2) women speak less frequently than their male counterparts and 3) students often sit in gender specific groups. In this roundtable, I will discuss the findings of follow-up focus groups conducted with undergraduate and MA-level students in the school. While some focus groups were led by members of staff, many of them were led by students themselves, in order to prevent complications relating to hierarchy and power."

Whether she takes the form of a queen bee in the pages of recent best-selling exposes, a Mean Girl in Hollywood cinema, or a tearful reformed bully featured on daytime television talk shows, the young female aggressor has become a focal point for public discourse about the risks and problems associated with growing up female. Moreover, she has become a figure that stands in for historically specific anxieties and tensions concerning adult women.

This project explores how the figure of the female bully functions in our current social and political context. Using a feminist poststructuralist frame of analysis, the study explores how female aggression is represented as a particular type of social problem across a range of social texts, including media texts and social science research. These narratives of young female aggression are examined in relation to broader discourses about the family, social policies such as safe school acts, and media coverage of torture at Abu Ghraib prison."

Our sample was comprised of 13 individuals who blew the whistle on university athletic departments at which they worked or were closely connected. Based upon a grounded theory analysis, we argue that whistle-blowing within the collegiate sports context is a gendered process. This conclusion was based on three themes which emerged from the data: gendered retaliation, females as irrational, and structuring isolation. The sum total of these three responses to collegiate sports whistle-blowers seems to be to characterize them as interlopers, or to position them as outside the inner circle of major college athletics. This paper concludes with a discussion of the findings, future research, and limitations."
2007-0642,"Gender, Emotion and Emotional Labour in Public Relations",Giving Up Cognitive Control: Public Relations and the Turn to Emotion,,,,Paper,"Gender, Emotion and Emotional Labour in Public Relations",Giving Up Cognitive Control: Public Relations and the Turn to Emotion,"Emotion is traditionally seen as something that gets in the way of acting rationally and that negative emotions in particular have to be denied or overcome. Yet emotions influence and shape every area of human activity. While public relations practitioners may be more inclined towards an emotional-intelligence or personality model of public relations, the concern of scholars in the field has been the rational-intelligence approach or knowledge model (Van Ruler, 2005). The turn towards emotion in the sociology of organisations literature provides the basis for discussion and for this reason alone warrants attention in public relations. I argue that to instil and maintain confidence in relationships with clients, journalists, colleagues and others, PR practitioners (and particularly women, given the increasing feminization of PR) are required to develop specific competencies in managing emotion. In turning our attention towards emotion in organisations and the concept of emotional labour (Hochschild, 1983) in performing professional roles, we will develop a deeper understanding of how professional identities in PR are made and understood."

This research conducted a survey of 456 mobile phone users in the Seoul metropolitan area, and found several statistically significant differences between men and women in different age groups in terms of their mobile phone usage and their adoptability of various multimedia functions of the mobile phone. Contrary to the stereotypical passivity in womens utilization of new media technologies, the results of this research show that women are more active than men in adopting multimedia functions of the mobile phone and have stronger willingness to adopt such functions in the future. The traditional assumption of gender gap in the adoption of new media technologies needs to be reexamined."

Ghanaian Newspapers Framing of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs),"Ripped From the Headlines: Sex, News, Spectacle",,,,Paper,Gender Neutral or Male Sphere? Ghanaian Newspapers Framing of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs),"Ripped From the Headlines: Sex, News, Spectacle","Abstract
This study looked at how the Ghanaian media frame ICTs as a male-sphere by analyzing newspaper content of two leading newspapers  The Daily Graphic and The Ghanaian Chronicle for 2005. An analysis of 281 stories showed that ICT stories were covered more often by men than women reporters. ICT stories relied heavily on male sources and photographs accompanying the stories were predominately of men. Most of the stories tended to frame ICTs as a technical issue rather than a social issue and lacked any gender analysis of the social impact of ICTs on men and women. Interviews with journalists revealed that beyond the notion held by some of the reporters that ICTs were gender neutral, there were additional factors such as the conceptualization of ICTs, newsroom norms, and journalistic competence of ICT reporting that influenced how ICTs were framed by the Ghanaian media."

The study revealed that depending on their races and their gender, different kinds of stereotypes were portrayed in Korean adolescent girls magazines. More reverse-stereotypical images, in a Korean cultural sense, were portrayed by Western women and socially and culturally expected female roles in Korea were portrayed by Korean women. Two effects of those stereotypical images were suggested. Korean adolescent girls are expected to emulate what they would perceive as accepted or ideal female roles portrayed by Korean women, and they might think that reverse-stereotypical or liberated female images portrayed by Western women are not relevant to them and unattainable by them. In other words, Korean girls could be belittled by both positive male images and Western female images in advertising."

(Such a link offers a theoretical route through which educational media content, such as television news, can indirectly foster dialogue by bolstering perceived understanding of a topic.) Here we go beyond the Southwell and Torres evidence, however, to directly assess a persons conversational role in reported conversations about science, as we hypothesize that conversation is most likely to bear a relationship to perceived understanding of science for those who regularly take an active part in talking (as opposed to simply being present when others talk). Results support this hypothesis: perceived understanding of science predicts active conversing, which is both noteworthy by itself and important to emerging literature regarding the links between interpersonal and mass communication."

Using selected ads about medications for major health conditions, this study assesses the effects of priming beliefs in genetic susceptibility to health conditions on individuals inferences about personal genetic susceptibility, self-efficacy to stay healthy, and behavioral health intentions. A nationally representative sample of 395 adults was randomly assigned to one of 2 conditions. In the genetic condition, participants viewed 3 prescription drug ads in which genetic cues were included and another masking ad. In the nongenetic condition, all genetic cues in the same ads were deleted or replaced. Genetic primes had no impacts on inferences of personal genetic susceptibility, but they did enhance self-efficacy to stay healthy and the intention to engage in healthy lifestyles. Information seeking about genetic risk increased as an indirect result of exposure to genetic cues in the ads, possibly being mediated through self-efficacy. Intentions to purchase the drug Actonel were elevated by genetic cues in the ads, whereas indirect effects of genetic cues through self-efficacy were found with Vytorin. The data overall suggest that genetic cues in DTC ads, in the presence of efficacious remedies for health conditions, produce elevated perception of ordinary health risk, and hence, enhance motivation to reduce ones risk employing both healthy lifestyle and pharmaceutical assistance."
2007-0648,Genocide in the News: Media Attention and Media Framing of the Darfur Conflict,Priming and Framing in Accounts of Death and Human Suffering: The Role of Politics in Reports of Conflict,,,,Paper,Genocide in the News: Media Attention and Media Framing of the Darfur Conflict,Priming and Framing in Accounts of Death and Human Suffering: The Role of Politics in Reports of Conflict,"When fighting broke out in the region of Darfur in Western Sudan in 2003 and quickly turned into a humanitarian crisis of enormous scope, the American mass media was very slow to react. Using Anthony Downs classic model of the issue attention cycle as a theoretical foundation, the author examines the course of attention the New York Times and the Washington Post paid to Darfur during the first 3 years of the crisis. The analysis shows how triggering or focusing events as well as actions and announcements by official sources can shape the medias attention towards an issue. Drawing on works by Robert Entman (2004) as well as William Gamson and Kathry Lasch (1983), media frames in the coverage of the Darfur conflict are analyzed. It is illustrated how different actors are successful in communicating their frames in different newspaper desks, how the experience of the Rwandan genocide was utilized to contextualize the events in Darfur, and how the national ethos, in which a newspaper is rooted, affects its framing of an issue."
2007-0649,Genre and the Pricing of Television Ad Time,Audience Economics: How Valuation and Measurement of Audience Affects Media Institutions,,,,Paper,Genre and the Pricing of Television Ad Time,Audience Economics: How Valuation and Measurement of Audience Affects Media Institutions,"Advertisers reliance on demographic information about audiences to evaluate and purchase time in television programs has been a matter of controversy in the literatures on the pricing of TV ad time and the design of media buying strategies by advertisers. Advertisers use demographic measures to predict the products likely purchased by members of a programs audience, but it is recognized that the indirectness of this measure of audience purchase proclivities is a significant limitation. In earlier work (Fu and Wildman, 2006) we provided empirical evidence that (1) advertisers employ more information about audiences purchase behavior than can be gleaned from the demographic statistics provided by commercial ratings services and (2) that the mix of products purchased by the members of a programs audience contributes substantially to an empirical explanation of prices paid for the programs ad time. In this paper we show that advertisers may look to a programs genre as an indicator of the types of products purchased by members of its audience that allows them to make more efficient media buys than would be possible with demographic information alone. The correlation between genre and purchase behavior also contributes to a significant correlation between the genre and the price of programs ad time."
2007-0650,Genre Work,Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,,,,Paper,Genre Work,Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,"Genre work involves multiple modes of engagement. It is the work of being both immersed in watching a genre, and reflecting on this experience. The term is a play on dream work, a psychodynamic term that describes the processes involved in gathering psychic material, and recounting and interpreting dreams, in order to better understand the relationship between our unconscious and conscious selves. For Bollas (1992) dream work is a never ending process where we dream work ourselves into becoming who we are, thus connecting psychoanalysis and self-experience. Genre work also refers to the psychoanalytic term working through, used by Ellis to explain the way television processes the material world into narrativised forms (2002). The idea of genre work is used to better understand audiences of factual and reality genres. Being a factual viewer means taking on multiple roles, as witness and interpreter, and occupying multiple spaces, between fact and fiction. The intermediate space of factual genres can be transformative, and at times viewers will personally connect with a programme, reflecting on what it means to them, creating a powerful self-reflexive space. When viewers watch, talk about, and reflect on, news, documentary and reality TV, they are transforming the basic elements of genres into something far more powerful than their original component parts. Viewers become alchemists, transforming factual genres from audio-visual documentation into personal, cultural and social experiences. This research is based on quantitative and qualitative audience, using nationally representative samples in Britain and Sweden."

A content analysis of prime-time programming (N=66 hours) is used to compose questions about the prevalence of different occupations in the USA and Israel. A sample of 655 students answered the questions. Viewing of American programming is significantly correlated with a tendency to hold a biased estimation of the prevalence of certain occupations in America in a manner that resembles the world of TV content. Viewing of Israeli programs has no such impact on the estimation of occupations prevalence in Israel. General viewing has no influence on the estimations made about any of the countries.

This paper provides a background to the development of criminal libel laws in the British Caribbean. It also traces the decision, the threats and actions brought against the media by the Grenadian government in its aftermath and the likely effect that it could have on the law of libel in the entire British Caribbean."

Reconsidering my research on public reactions to UK Tory MP Boris Johnson, I ask if apparently superficial comments indicate how alienated audiences can read themselves into the world of representative, and represented politics. John Street warns that it is too early to condemn the celebrity politician, since there remains a great deal to be understood about how such a figure can be within specific modes of media organisation. The Johnson case study shows the idea that politics should be entertaining does not necessarily contradict what Corner & Robinson understand as critical/structuralist positions, that tend to concentrate on information as the touchstone of democratic communication. As a result, the gulf between structure and agency in audiences negotiations of the political landscape may not be as wide as it seems."

This paper analyses the ways in which the system promoted diversity in media ownership over the last decade. Interrogation of data on 28,354 applicants for 16,383 licenses between 1995 and 2006 reveals that while 1 in 10 applicant businesses were minorityowned, only 1 in 13 qualified bidders were minorityowned, and fewer than 1 in 14 bid winners were minorityowned. A binary logistic regression model reveals that being a minorityowned business has the strongest negative impact, controlling for other demographic and market variables, on the probability of successfully qualifying to bid on a broadcast license. The FCC has done a significant amount of work to improve the transparency of its licensing system, and this analysis is helpful in identifying and measuring the impact of the remaining organizational barriers to entry for minorityowned businesses."
2007-0655,Getting Our Story Out: Narrative Identity and Perceptions of Message Effectiveness in Progressive Social Movements,Movements,,,,Paper,Getting Our Story Out: Narrative Identity and Perceptions of Message Effectiveness in Progressive Social Movements,Movements,"Recent contributions to social movement theory encourage scholars to include narratives as part of their analysis of the processes that social movements use to generate collective action frames, establish collective identity, and mobilize resources and people for action. In this case study of political progressives from a rural area in the Northwest region of the United States, we analyze the narratives that they use to describe their perception of the effectiveness of their political messages. Using in-depth observation and surveys before and after a workshop on politics and language use, we find political progressives have strong narrative identity of being ineffectual communicators. This case suggests yet another way that narrative approaches to social movements can enrich understandings of social movement dynamics. Our research generates two central propositions for further study. First, progressive actors narrative identities are shaped by their perceptions of their effectiveness in the mass media. Second, media frames may recursively shape narrative identities of social movement actors. This link between social movement actors perceptions of effectiveness and media coverage deserves further attention by communication scholars."

The contributions made by feminist critique of gender norms and by cultural studies approaches to youth culture focusing on cultural and subcultural communities and/or capital to understanding girl culture are undeniable. However, I want to propose here that an analysis of the continuities and discontinuities of contemporary ""girl culture"" also raise some questions about the dominant terms of such approaches. This presentation considers whether ""girl culture capital"" might be neither ""cultural capital"" nor ""subcultural capital"", neither ""conformist"" nor ""resistant"" in terms of gender norms, but in fact something else that exceeds and questions those oppositions.

Celebrities are often thought to function as role models and hence are sometimes critiqued for failing to provide positive or correct examples. Studies on the meanings of girl power, however, are rarely grounded in audience research. Based on focus group interviews with Dutch girls aged 12-13, we argue that girls use celebrities as an identity tool. The girls actively engage in a reflexive project of the self through appropriating the narratives of celebrities to their everyday lives. Talking about celebrity success led to articulations about the makeability and authenticity of the celebrity, and subsequently to reflections on their own identities and life opportunities."

Workplace freedom of speech has been linked to organizational effectiveness, employee satisfaction, employee commitment, and a variety of other positive effects, as employees feel free to express disagreement without fear of organizational sanctions. This study links workplace freedom of speech with specific organizational dissent message types. Results showed that workers who reported less workplace freedom of speech were more likely to use messages of humor, upward appeals, and coalitions. That is, dissenters perceiving less freedom were more likely to couch their dissent as offhanded remarks that could later be labeled jokes, more likely to circumvent a supervisor to express the dissent to someone higher in the organization, and more likely to attempt to build shared understanding and support among others."

Specifically, it documents the newspapers relationship with each other and analyzes the competing discourses of ethnic, community and national identity embedded in the journalistic texts. The study suggests that as US ethnic and racial demographics continue shifting in global cities particular attention must be paid to the dynamic role of the ethnic media. Examining the production of meanings in ethnic and general-market news coverage in relation to one another presents an opportunity for rethinking the role of Latina/o journalism in public negotiations over constructs of community, national identity and ethnic and racial difference.

These ownership patterns allow local editions of international womens magazines to negotiate the tension and contradiction between the global media and local publishers. On the one hand, international womens magazines tend to maintain their magazine concept globally and pursue standardization strategy in order to maintain a consistent brand image. On the other hand, international womens magazines need to localize content to win local readers. Thus, international womens magazines in Korea can be an interesting site for exploring the dynamic interaction between the global and the local. This study investigated how global and local forces were involved and interrelated in the production process of international womens magazines in Korea. To explore the dynamic interaction between the global and local forces, both globalization and localization efforts of international womens magazines which occur during the production process were examined through in-depth interviews with personnel in the magazine industry. The findings showed that the localization process of international womens magazines is neither homogenization nor heterogenization. Instead, both of these aspects were found in the production of international womens magazines in Korea."

Among those, one approach comprises discourses that identify cultural hybridity or hybridization that investigate power relations between center and periphery. The Korean Wave is a clear indication of such new global - and regional transformations in the cultural arena. At the global level, it signifies multidirectional transnational cultural flows in which the previous cultural peripheries began to have a presence and a voice in the cultural centers or cores. What this phenomenon also signifies is a regionalization of transnational cultural flows as it entails Asian countries' increasing acceptance of cultural information from neighboring countries that share similar economic and cultural backgrounds rather than from economically and politically powerful others. Above all, new cultural formations are in the making, and the Korean Wave is a first sign of how a country in-between can find a niche and reposition itself as an influential cultural mediator and creator in the midst of global cultural transformation."

It analyses both the European Union's 1998 regulatory package and its subsequent 2002 Electronic Communications Regulatory Framework. It points to the way that Member States have 'domesticated' EU agreed regulatory policies within a Community regulatory framework that relies on National Regulatory Authorities for implementation. It points to the emergence of a regulatory state at national and EU levels and discusses the tensions between competition state behaviour at both levels."

By analyzing their criticism of Fifth-Generation films, especially those of Zhang Yimou, this paper examines how Chinese postmodernists in the 1990s perceived their cultural predicament since the capitalist transformation of the 1980s. It tends to probe the argument that their solution to cultural predicament leads to reinforce China/West binarism and their self-empowered solution is inseparable from international reception. Chinese intellectuals reaction of Chinese modernity as an alternative to Western cultural hegemony strengthens the binarism they attempt to oppose."

Norms against genocide denial are instrumental in articulating collective memory. As a form of morality policy, they redistribute moral capital and redefine identity, as well as the terms of national integration into a strategic global geo-political order. This paper inquires about the media-related factors that influence the development and diffusion of transnational moral governance norms, such as those against hate speech, as well as the conditions for institutionalization of these norms as global or regional prohibition regimes. The paper compares American media coverage of the recent controversy surrounding the PBS debate on the Armenian genocide with French media coverage of the recent French law against Armenian genocide denial. The paper identifies the extent to which certain definitions of harm and offensiveness are starting to converge."

It examines how the ritual processes of the markets confer varying degrees of prestige on participants. As a cultural attribute, prestige can only be conferred through rituals such as those enacted at the international markets, but as a corporate strategy, prestige gives participants different levels of control over such essential business concerns as program prices and perceptions about the universality of ones programming. Consequently, these rituals produce industry lore about the types of creative practices and imaginative connections among transnational viewers that are and are not possible in an increasingly commercial and global media environment."

Yet to date, there has been little conclusive research on how culture shapes audiences perceptions of the visual images they see in the media. In this qualitative study the authors asked respondents in the USA, India, and Singapore what they saw in the visuals used in global ads. They found that both Indians and Singaporeans described the connections or relationships between objects and people more often than Americans but that Singaporeans and Americans were far more analytic in their descriptions than Indian respondents."

Google Earth turns us all into particular kinds of viewing subjects, a subjectivity that must be understood through the tension between getting closer to the ground, while also achieving an objective distance. The images interpellate the viewer into a particular subject position, or gaze, that implies one is dominant over what one is looking at. We all become like Apollo, godlike world makers interpolated by a subject position that allows us to engage in the fantasy of global omniscience. To really assess the kind of ideological work overhead imagery performs for the observer and the observed, this paper goes back to talk about some the origins of the very same practices and technologies that make Google Earth possible, a genealogy that partially resides in military aerial and satellite reconnaissance systems. Taking the language of Foucault on the use of imagery in scientific discourse, where imagery defines the body within scientific codes of deviance and normalcy, satellite images do the same thing with the ground, creating and classifying objects as either normal or abnormal, benign or threat, etc. Satellite imagery creates images of the Other, such as rogue nations, and fits into classic discourses of colonialism and global domination. Google Earth not only reveals objects on the ground, but produces them through regimes of classification and geospatial measurement, while also producing particular kinds of viewing subjects."

However, the relationship between these two nations is still difficult and the British media sometimes portray Germany as the old enemy of the Second World War. In 2005 Dresden commemorated the 60th anniversary of the bombing of the city on February 13, 1945. Now the questions arise: How do the British media report about this special date? And in comparison to that, how do the German media deal with this topic? Is the question: Who is to blame for the destruction of Dresden? after 60 years still discussed? A content analysis of the leading German and British newspapers will answer these questions. The authors of this paper identified certain news values that are especially relevant for the international news coverage. They tested them by analyzing the coverage about February 13, 1945 and 60 years later."
2007-0672,Grounding and Information Communication in Canadian-Chinese Discourse,Creating Learning Contexts,,,,Paper,Grounding and Information Communication in Canadian-Chinese Discourse,Creating Learning Contexts,"Past research has identified grounding as a central process of human dialogue but it is unknown whether grounding can be experimentally manipulated to facilitate listener recall. This study randomly assigned 40 intercultural dyads (Anglo-Canadians and Mainland Chinese) into experimental and control groups. Prior to their conversations, the experimental groups received 10-15 minutes training on grounding which included 5 questions by the listener requesting the current speaker to slow down, to repeat, to explain, or to reformulate what was just said. The control groups did not receive any training. All conversations were videotaped, transcribed and microanalyzed. It was found that the trained groups achieved significantly higher scores than the untrained groups in all three categories: grounding, speaker presentation and listener recall, thus documenting that the 10-15 minutes training on grounding was fruitful. In the trained groups, grounding scores were not directly correlated with listener recall scores but indirectly related. Speaker presentation scores were highly correlated with both grounding and listener recall scores. In the untrained groups, the relationships among grounding, speaker presentation and listener recall were quite different from those observed in the trained groups. It is argued that training on grounding may have opened a new avenue for intercultural interlocutors to reduce miscommunication, thus improving information transmission."

This notion will be examined by exploring communication rules of appointments and coordination within the peer groups. Peer groups are the frame of action in which adolescents form and experience new types of relationships that are characterized by a relatively high stability with regard to personal compositions, communication and interaction patterns as well as expectations and modes of action. The cell phone is an indispensable medium that answers the purpose to perpetuate and organize peer relationships. With regard to new forms of communication and interaction that are mirrored in the structures and dynamics of these relationships, this paper aims at answering three questions: What is the nature of communication rules in peer groups that are negotiated through the cell phone? How do expectations and beliefs towards a relationship that are based on the rules established by cell phone use materialize? What is the nature of patterns of interaction and action in peer relationships that derive from this type of communication rules?

The empirical results are based on qualitative interviews with German and Turkish adolescents. The findings show that there are certain communication rules applied to all members of the peer group while other rules surface in specific peer constellations. To own a cell phone and be reachable is the essential agreement in peer groups and leads to dynamic forms of group coordination like changing set times, being late or canceling appointments at last notice. Behind these rather unstable and spontaneous interactions lies the endeavor to establish rules and routines that create a feeling of security and stability. One example of establishing routines implies a certain kind of control and refers to outgoing text message folders. Using this function the recipient of a text message is forced to answer or somehow react because there is no possibility left to say, the message has not reached him or her.

The results of this paper show that in a concept of mediated interpersonal communication the lifestyle of different groups (e.g. adolescents, kids) and special dynamics of theses groups (at this one should be aware of communication rules established within a network) should be integrated."

boarded a chartered US Airlines flight dubbed Gutenbergs Folly for a
12-day tour of America. They visited Chicago, Detroit, LA, and Phoenix;
dined with Walter Lippmann, visited Frank Lloyd Wright, toured Disney
Land (as the personal guests of Walt Disney), visited automobile
factories, and more. The editors were in the US for the International
Press Institutes Annual Assembly held in Washington, DCthe first time
the event had ever been held in America. With substantial funds from
the Ford Foundation and the US Government Affairs Institute (GAI), the
tour was considered a rousing success by all involved. But what is of
particular interest is that the tour was deemed to be in the national
interest of the United States. This paper offers a historical case
study that illustrates the way journalism was embedded inside the nexus
created by the military-industrial and military-intellectual complexes
during the Cold War, particularly during the era of journalistic high
modernism (Hallin 1994). The tale of the Gutenbergs Folly tour not
only crystallizes culturally held beliefs about the proper role of the
journalist but also reveals the way key institutionslike private
foundations, professional associations, and the US government
collaborated on projects designed to spread a global faith in the
values of democracy and consumer culture. The international editors
hailing from, for example, Germany, Japan, Turkey, and Italyhad
already been vetted; as members of IPI they were seen by US officials
as supporters of freedom of the press and of the individual. As

Three types of failure are explicated. The first type consists of errors, confusions, and misunderstandings that occur within everyday lifeworld communication aimed at agreement and understanding (communicative action). The second type consists of failures to attain strategic goals within broader macrosocial communication processes aimed at technical or social success (strategic action). The third type occurs when the social systems mechanisms of strategic action interfere with everyday processes of linguistic agreement. Theoretical implications for understanding Habermas's work and for analyzing the psychological and sociological causes and consequences of communication failures are discussed."

Letourneau Case","Ripped From the Headlines: Sex, News, Spectacle",,,,Paper,"Happily Ever After: Myth, Rape, and Romance in the Mary K. Letourneau Case","Ripped From the Headlines: Sex, News, Spectacle","This study draws on previous research that argues journalists rely on myth to tell stories, explain the unexplainable, and reaffirm social ideals. We analyze articles in Time and People magazines of a teacher/student rape case that does not fit cultural perceptions of rape because the teacher is a woman convicted of raping her 12-year-old male student. The story is unusual since our cultural understanding of rape points to men as perpetrators. The research illustrates how journalists rely on rape misconceptions and myths of proper (hetero)sexual roles, including the Good Mother and Heroine in romantic fairy tales, to report this story. We argue journalists do this in an effort to make sense of the tale but in doing so ultimately construct a narrative that erased the seriousness of the crime and turned a tale of rape into a romance the (re)established masculine hegemony."

This discourse is situated among a mix of secretive and openly racist groups. It remains unexamined, in part, because much attention has been given recently to modern or covert racism. However, as technology allows groups labeled as traditionally racist to bond and form a greater collective strength online, their strategies are becoming less traditional. Conventional wisdom would assume these groups use referential or direct means of indexing identity. This analysis of the Terrible Tommy Show demonstrates that even the most traditional racists employ a complex pattern of voicing to indirectly index what amounts to a neo-traditional racist identity. These findings illustrate that within these communities, there is not only a sense of whiteness, but also a set of practices delineating good and bad white identity."

One area of this dialogue that has been largely overlooked is the relationship that historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are creating with their respective minority (non-black) constituents. This study examined how these institutions used their web sites to build relationships with prospective Asian, Caucasian and Hispanic students. A content analysis of the found no significant differences in the photographs of diversity presented on the home pages of public and private colleges and universities. Public institutions, however, had significantly more references regarding physical challenges, international students and religious beliefs. When the institutions from the South were compared to other regions, significant differences emerged in two areas. The South was less likely to have references for the physically challenged and for gay and lesbian students. None of the sites included photographs of disabled students."

Inequities in the adoption of broadband technology were examined along with the implications of broadband Internet for personal health. Data from two population-based surveys conducted by the National Cancer Institute in 2003 (N = 6369) and 2005 (N = 5586) were analyzed. Results showed that those who were younger, more educated, and lived in an urban area were more likely to have a broadband Internet connection in their home at both time points. Further, those with a broadband connection, as compared with a dial-up connection, were more likely to report using the Internet to seek health information, e-mail their doctor, purchase medications, and talk with their health care provider about the results of an Internet search. The implications of these findings for the development of health communication theories and campaigns are discussed."

Yet, few studies have systematically examined the coverage of health issues on local television newscasts. This study examined 40,112 news stories that aired on seven channels in four midwest U.S. markets during four composite weeks from December 2004 to June 2005. Each channels local morning, noon, and early and late evening newscasts were analyzed. About 8.1% of the coded news stories were devoted to health content. Physical illnesses/diseases and healthy living issues received the most frequent coverage. Mental health and aging related content were covered least frequently. Health news stories generally were less than one minute long. Most health news stories were neutral in tone. Few offered contrasting viewpoints or follow-up information. Market size did not show a clear pattern of influence on health content although there was significant variation across and within markets. Implications for health professionals, policy makers, and health communication researchers are discussed."

Offline measures of comprehension provide only limited insights into how readers process text and graphics. To gain a clearer understanding of health news comprehension by Web users, it is helpful to explore effects of non-linear message structures and how readers process textual and visual health messages in real time. This interdisciplinary study, conducted by a communication scholar and another from educational psychology at the University of Utah, investigates cognitive processes related to how the public attends to health news using eye-tracking hardware and measurements. Previous research has used eye-tracking technology primarily to study reading processes (Rayner, 1998), but the technology is employed in this study to see if the hardware provides valid measurements to visual stimuli such as health information. In this experiment, health news is presented in either the explanatory structure-building format (Yaros, 2006) or the traditional inverted pyramid news structure that arranges facts by their perceived importance (van Dijk, 1985). Participants processing times on target regions in the stories and explanatory graphics are discussed"

Results are based on an online questionnaire (N = 189) among users of a variety health forums. Findings show that features that are often mentioned in literature on computer-mediated communication (i.e., the anonymity it affords, the text-based character, and the possibility it offers to network expansion) are recognized, but appreciated differently by users that vary in the degree to which they perceive to suffer from a stigmatized condition or are restricted in their mobility: Stigmatization is related to appreciation of anonymity, and restriction of mobility to network expansion. The study also showed an overall positive effect of using forums on the degree to which people were better able to cope with the situation they were facing. This was especially so for people that use forums because they find them a convenient tool, use it for inclusion or information. A negative effect on coping was found for people that primarily use forums for discussion. Results are discussed in the final part."

Through discourse and quantitative content analysis of newspaper coverage, we look at how news texts create differing subject positions in health discourse, embedded in differing ideologies about who is authorized to create and circulate public knowledge about health. In an earlier paper, we argue that neoliberalism has lead to the hierarchical doctors orders model of biocommunicability giving way to an active patient-consumer model, and explore contradictions that arise from the clash between the ideology of scientific authority and professional responsibility and that of the market. Here we show how the weakening of biomedical authority not only by the market, but also by social movements and the rights revolution sometimes propduces a public sphere model of biocommunicability in which citizens are seen as participants in democratic debate about health issues, and show how this model interacts with the other two in health care coverage."

Exemplification theory (Zillmann, 1999) and cognitive-experiential self-theory of personality (CEST; Epstein, 2003) served as theoretical frameworks. In an online experiment, 298 participants browsed through an experimental online newsmagazine. Exemplification was manipulated as between-factor in half of the articles (featuring exemplar or base-rate information), while additional constant articles served as competing reading material. Selective exposure to health information was logged by software as dependent measure. Individual differences in information processing styles (rationality and experientiality) and gender were ascertained by questionnaire. The results show that men uniformly preferred concrete exemplar information, while womens processing style affected how much time they spent on the manipulated articles. Exploratory analyses revealed that exemplification and processing style combined also affected magazine evaluations."

The campaign utilizes techniques of documentary filmmaking and news, including a hand-held camera and a confessional script, portraying Miller as a rebellious iconoclast with little or no interest in conventional success. The ads then invite fellow rebellious souls to become bodeists and join Miller at a Nike-sponsored website. Millers success on the slopes was irrelevant to the advertising campaign; the message that winning isnt everything works regardless if Miller medaled or not. In this paper, I will use semiotic analysis to demonstrate how the eight advertisements employ counterhegemonic language and imagery to seemingly encourage rebellion and individuality. In actuality, the ads serve to further enhance corporate profits and image. Nike, by nature of being a multibillion dollar, multinational enterprise, holds a distinct attribute: that of an insider. Miller, despite his subcultural posturing, also maintains insider status as a world-class ski champion. But in this self-aware campaign, the corporation and the skier are engaged in a creative bit of rebellion. Nike and Miller work together to cultivate the notion of an outsider subculture designed to support the corporations hegemony while at the same time appearing counterhegemonic."

Specifically, the paper examines how much television Hispanic Americans view, what specific television programs they view, why they select and avoid certain television programs, and how their selection and avoidance is related to perceptions of their groups vitality. Results indicate that Hispanic American college students primarily view English language programs and are motivated to select and avoid television for a variety of reasons (including learning, companionship, and ethnic identity). Importantly, television selection and avoidance for ethnic identity gratifications are related to ethnic identity and vitality perceptions."

These cheap pocketbooks portrayed sadomasochistic sex between SS female guards and Allied soldiers in POW camps (aka Stalags). Although based on American men's magazines, the Stalags were all written in Hebrew by native-Israeli authors and were printed and distributed in Israel by small publishing houses. While readers came from all parts of society, they were particularly popular amongst Israeli-born teenagers, many of whom children of Holocaust survivors. These texts, we argue, constitute an early attempt to engage with the trauma of the Holocaust on the popular level, an attempt which contrasted with official commemoration efforts (i.e. the Eichmann trial, Holocaust memorials, canonic Shoah literature, etc.). As such, the Stalags provided an important cultural site wherein the second generation of the Holocaust negotiated its identity vis-à-vis the parents' generation and Zionist ideology. These highly improbable and indeed perverse narratives nevertheless allow approaching the trauma from a different perspectiveadmitting not only the bare facts but also the way these were incorporated into the imagination of young people in Israel of the 1960's."

In this paper, the author first explores the horizontal power of the circuit as a foundation for his own communication research. He argues that paying attention to the circuits five moments of culture prompts us to account for a very wide range of experience. But the circuit of culture, in its present form, could be enhanced by a key, attainable, dimension. Including a sense of the researchers reflexive interpretations, as well as those of the research report audience, creates a vertical depth allowing us to account, in a more complete way, for the process of meaning."

With respect to the media environment in which alternative media are claimed, Marxist and critical scholars stress dominant hegemony involved in mass media, while Foucault and his followers focus on immanent power engaged in knowledge production. This study describes key concepts of alternative media as proposed by many scholars and attempts to draw on a typology of existing definitions. A wide range of definitions of alternative media, however, can be generally reconsidered in two ways: counterhegemonic or participatory media. Examining compatibility of both approaches, this study describes how alternative media are related with social movements in the new media age. Finally, this study suggests conceptualizing digital alternative media in the global age as decentralized-communication-networks against centralized-corporate-globalization."

We used data from a representative population survey of adults (n=2999). Logistic regression analysis revealed that current and ex-smokers higher in transportability were more likely (O.R.=1.11, p<.001) to perceive they had been helped by antismoking advertising in their attempts to quit smoking. Transportability was also related to the recall of narrative antismoking advertisements, particularly for those individuals from typically low transportability sociodemographic groups. Among current smokers, those who engaged in interpersonal discussion about any antismoking advertising were more likely to have made a quit attempt (O.R=2.98, p<.001). Finally, individuals were most likely to discuss advertising containing information about the negative health consequences of smoking using graphic images or simulations of bodily processes."

Matching the journalistic fields expectations, this natural disaster provides journalists, who deal with climate change, with an opportunity to redefine this problem (and so their own positions) within the newsroom hierarchy.
Although they are not systematically linked with climate change, breaking news on natural disasters contribute to modifying the journalistic understanding of the problem. Perceived as an abstract phenomenon to be explained, the climate change is now framed in French news media as an explanation of natural events. Also, the breaking news on natural disasters now emphasizes the human responsibility rather than perceiving it as a fatalistic natural phenomenon.
Breaking news are used to prime an issues newsworthiness. Such an use relies on a claimsmakers long political work which consists in gathering public opinion capital. This politicisation work needs and feeds some (journalistic) framing of problems which paradoxically depoliticizes it; for instance when the focus on consequences hides causes or when energy saving and climate change issues are dissociated from everyday policies."

Foreign Affairs Reporting in the Wake of 9/11,International & Development Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Most studies that have assessed U.S. coverage of other nations, peoples, and events comes to the same conclusion: American news media oversimplify, decontextualize, and fail to meaningfully translate foreign news to the American people. A major debate is how to increase both the quantity and quality of foreign news provided to the public. The author suggests that quantity of international news does not necessarily equal comprehensive and useful coverage of foreign affairs. Specifically, this work examines how news selection and gate keeping differs from culture to culture, often representing the governments views on international issues. In addition it explores the current challenges of good reporting of foreign events and examines solutions on how to get as comprehensive international coverage as possible to the public and in what form."

Findings From a National Survey,The Right to Know and the Right Not to Be Known,"Unlike regulators in other societiesthe European Union, for examplelawmakers in the United States have provided the citizenry with no unified perspective through which they can straightforwardly understand how merchants must approach the privacy of their personal information. Generally, merchants have kept the right to store and use data that flow from their interactions with customers without their permission or knowledge. There are, however, areas where exploitation of personal data for selling is prohibited. The absence of a framework that U.S. government officials can use to explain privacy regulations in the commercial realm raises questions as to what citizens understand about the rights of merchants to share information about them with other parties. Our study uses a knowledge frameworks approach to address this unexplored area. We found that most of the respondents tended to believe that certain kinds of merchants are allowed to share their personal information about their customers while other kinds of merchants are not. While this understanding of the US marketplace is technically accurate, the findings also show that Americans are strikingly inaccurate in knowing the rules of particular markets regarding information sharing even while they know the rules of other markets. The study raises the question of whether the best approach for educating people in the absence of a national philosophy for privacy regulation is to encourage consumers to create knowledge frameworks that foreground skepticism and overstate the lack of privacy protections so that they will be more correct than mistaken on the subject."

Amidst these discussions, however, little thought has been paid to the audiences for programs of this sort, and (even when viewers are considered) the research can too easily treat audiences in homogenous terms and therefore replicate the very dichotomies that these television shows directly challenge. Consciously attempting to avoid these flaws, this paper is a critical reflection on an audience study into the Australian morning newstainment program Sunrise. It examines ethnography/participant observation (coupled with discourse analysis) as a research tool for understanding the ways in which contemporary news forms are viewed and understood, and promotes its potential use in better conceptualizing how citizens integrate and connect the increasingly fragmented and multifarious forms of postmodern political communication available in their everyday lives."

Such a focus is unique in that there are few studies in intercultural contact research that explore how individuals construct their own definitions of intercultural contact. In this study, I interview 80 multicultural university students from various backgrounds (age, gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, sexuality, socioeconomic status, class status) and examine how they define, make sense of, and experience intercultural interaction on campus."

Untold online opportunities for story ideas, sources and inquiries are available. However, it is unclear how exactly journalists are using the Internet. The theory of information subsidies suggests that the cheaper and more accessible information is, the more valuable it is to journalists. The results of this descriptive study of professional journalists (N = 166) indicate that an overwhelming majority (67%) use Web sites for work purposes but far fewer (22%) said they verify Web information with another source before using it. Also, 36% of reporters said they conduct interviews via e-mail and 68% said they use e-mail press releases for story ideas. Additionally, the most active users of the Internet are editors with 5 to 10 years experience who are working at large circulation daily newspapers (100,000 or more) and graduated from college with a bachelors degree."

Research questions about the ways people seek information about others across various relationship types and between genders, and the communication modes they use to do so, drove the development and administration of a survey to 225 participants. Three patterns of media use were generally obtained: media used across all relationships, media that are unlikely to be used at all, and some that were favored for some relationships (e.g., classmates and prospective romantic partners) but not others (e.g., family members or best friends). Finally, the theoretical implications of these findings are discussed and directions for future research are examined."

Both Dan Browns 2003 novel and Ron Howards 2006 film adaptation center on an idea of the sacredness of femininity, which is juxtaposed with male-dominated Catholic dogma. These texts provide exposure for arguments rarely heard in mainstream popular culture about womens relationship to divinity and female sexuality more generally. Through close readings of the book and film, this paper examines how The DaVinci Code engages and challenges traditional notions of gender and religion, particularly, the Madonna/Whore dichotomy. However, I also argue that these texts' assertions rely on essentialized notions of straight white femininity, which insist that women are powerful, but, contradictorily, only insofar as they facilitate male orgasms, reproduce, and mother."

Over and over, the super-themes catalyzed traumatic, semi-involuntary post-memories and recovered memories that further blocked reconciliation. The super-themes are Is This Real History, Who Is Head of the Haunted House, Its All Political, Dont Speak of Dirty Linen, and The Morality Here Is Beyond Debate. Reconciliation is measured by aims of the South African Truth Commission: to persuade parties to agree on the same history and memories, break from them, heal wounds, forgive but do not forget, and build a new rights agenda."

Public trust in journalism has eroded at an even greater pace. Into the breach has stepped a host of new or reinvented entertainment genres that address contemporary public issues, events and people. As a result, efforts at uncovering what if any influence entertainment media has on public opinion, knowledge and action has increased in recent years. This paper will critically review the extant research on this topic that has used quantitative social science methods. My goals are to (1) provide an overview of current findings, as well as gaps in our knowledge; (2) explore the strengths and limits of the quantitative approach, both in general and as they specifically apply to the study of entertainment media as a form of political communication; and (3) suggest multi-method approaches that might build on the utility of quantitative research while addressing its shortcomings."

Pacing is measured based on 4 essential criteria suggested by previous literature, the number of cut changes, camera movements, active motion, and auditory features. Content analyses of current childrens programs show that education-oriented programs are slower paced than entertainment-oriented programs while live action programs are slower paced than animations. No pacing difference between programs targeted at preschool children and school-aged children is observed. However one 2-way and one 3-way interaction are observed. These interactions indicate that entertainment-oriented animation programs targeted at school-aged children are the fastest paced programs."

The 4 peer perceptions are drawn from literature on social norm campaigns (descriptive and injunctive norms) and on the Influence of Presumed Influence model (perceived media influence on peers). Analysis of cross-sectional survey data (N=519) finds that injunctive norm and perceived cigarette ad influence on peers seem to be more crucial determinants of college students smoking intention. In addition, the roles of the 2 peer perceptions appear significant only for those who thought about close peers. The findings suggest that social norm campaigners should pay more attention to correcting misperceived injunctive norm and influence of cigarette advertising on peers rather than to correcting misperceived descriptive norm. Generally, peer perception researchers should use the concept peer more carefully. A concept of peers more similar and perceivably closer should be used to design effective campaign messages and programs."

In contrast to predictions derived from general models of persuasion (ELM, HSM), current models of fictional persuasion propose that these effects are persistent. As preconditions of an increased effect over time are met, we predicted an absolute sleeper effect. Eighty-one participants read a pretested fictional story that contained 16 assertions about real-world topics or a control story. As expected, persuasive effects were present short-term and increased for a group with a 2-week assessment delay. Immediate effects on belief certainty disappeared over time, indicating that beliefs acquired by reading fictional narratives are integrated into real-world knowledge."
2007-0707,How Public Relations Professionalism Influences Corporate Social Responsibility: A Survey of Practitioners,Public Relations Profession and its Professionals,,,,Paper,How Public Relations Professionalism Influences Corporate Social Responsibility: A Survey of Practitioners,Public Relations Profession and its Professionals,"This study explored how public relations practitioners professionalism is associated with their attitudes towards corporate social responsibility. An online survey was completed by 289 respondents drawn from the national sample of membership of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA). Results revealed that practitioners with high professionalism have more positive attitudes towards corporate social responsibility. This study revealed empirically one of the most often emphasized concepts in public relations, public relations significant responsibility to society as an important value of professionalism. This study suggests ways for practitioners to improve their professionalism by focusing on their roles in giving an organization direction for being socially responsible."
2007-0708,How Questioning Constructs Moral Reasonableness: A State Court Hearing of a Same-Sex Marriage Appeal,Questions and Questioning: A Focal Practice for Constructing Selves and Social Scenes,,,,Paper,How Questioning Constructs Moral Reasonableness: A State Court Hearing of a Same-Sex Marriage Appeal,Questions and Questioning: A Focal Practice for Constructing Selves and Social Scenes,"On May 31, 2006, the New York Court of Appeals heard oral arguments for 44 same-sex couples who had been denied marriage licenses. The couples brought four law suits, asking the court to declare state practices restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples as violating the state constitution. The hearing, running just shy of 140 minutes, involved four attorneys for the petitioning couples and three for the responding state agencies making arguments and being questioned by the six Court of Appeals judges. This paper will analyze how the judges questioning contributed to solidifying the Discourse of Law, and how it implied identities for the petitioning couples, the presenting attorneys, and the judges themselves.

Questioning, when done by attorneys and directed at witnesses, has been extensively investigated (e.g., Abimola, 2002; Drew, 1992; Shuy, 1998; Woodbury, 1984) and there is a small body of work examining the language of judges. In small claims court ( Philips, 1990) during voir dire (Shuy, 1995), and in expressing decisions/opinions (Solan, 1993) we know how judges talk, but there has been little attention given to judges questioning of attorneys in oral arguments during appeals. In many appeal cases, a decision is made entirely based on the written briefs. Oral argument, typically, is allowed in only the most difficult cases. Although difficulty has many flavors, one kind is when a case taps into a controversy in the larger society about what is fair, right, and moral (Stratman, 1994). Same-sex marriage, at this time in the United States, is just such a controversy (Rollins, 2005).

The paper will provide background on the appeals process, the controversy about same-sex unions, and the key arguments advanced by the seven attorneys in the appeal hearing. Then, following a review of questioning research that describes how question form and discourse realization have been theorized and connected to question function and consequences, I describe the questioning strategies that the judges used and show the different ways questions revealed and constructed participant identities and the Discourse of The law. Using action-implicative discourse analysis (Tracy, 2005), the developed paper will draw on the deciding and the dissenting judge opinions, as well as friend of the court briefs (amicus curiae), to analyze the focal discourse materials (i.e., the videotape of the questioning and the transcript)."

Our textual analysis of the Dr. Phil show focuses on those performative and televisual aspects of the program that reveal McGraws strategic production of his brand of strong, masculine therapy. Televisions visual and linguistic significations of Dr. Phils imposing physique, Southern/Texan gentlemanliness, militaristic and corporate rhetoric, marital loyalty and happiness, and his containment of a largely female middle-class audience weave together the contours of McGraws manly Tell It Like It Is talk therapy."
2007-0710,How to Facilitate Social Networking in Inner-City Neighbourhoods?,Neighbours versus Friends Who Live Nearby: Communication Technology in Urban Neighbourhoods,,,,Paper,How to Facilitate Social Networking in Inner-City Neighbourhoods?,Neighbours versus Friends Who Live Nearby: Communication Technology in Urban Neighbourhoods,"Communication technology used by residents in urban neighbourhoods can support collective interaction for discussion about place and networked interaction for sociability in place. Examples of collective place-based interaction include structured online portals and public discussion forums which promote a one-to-many or many-to-many broadcast mode of communication. Offline, there are neighbourhood watches or street rejuvenation initiatives or any type of place-based community activism. These are valid reasons for neighbourhood interaction, but there can be other, more inherently social reasons.

Networked interaction for sociability in place describes the more private space occupied by a society of friendships, ie. social networks of friends who live within relative proximity to each other. They use informal peer-to-peer type of network communication tools such as email, SMS and instant messaging to interact online, but proximity enables them to gather face-to-face and interact offline. They see each other primarily as friends who live closeby and not as neighbours.

Despite not knowing many of their neighbours, urban residents believe that it is very likely that amongst all the residents, there may be some who they might be socially compatible with, alas certainly not all of them. Yet, apart from serendipitous encounters, there are no convenient means to find out if they are.

Neighbourhoods can provide opportunities to communicate, interact and socialise. How can the communication technology that is already well accepted by urban residents (such as email, SMS and instant messaging, and now increasingly social networking sites) play a role in realising such opportunities?"
2007-0711,How Users Form Beliefs About the Social Structure of Coaudiences,"Coviewing, Identification, and Media Enjoyment",,,,Paper,How Users Form Beliefs About the Social Structure of Coaudiences,"Coviewing, Identification, and Media Enjoyment","Following the model of coaudience perceptions, users of mass media create beliefs about their anonymous coaudience. In this paper we argue that a genuine cognitive attitude bias influences the way the social structure of the coaudience is perceived. By adapting and converting the insight that similarity breeds liking, we pursue the notion that a liking of the coaudience as an anonymous social group breeds similarity, while disliking breeds dissimilarity. To test our hypotheses a secondary analysis of an online survey dataset (N = 259) was conducted. We found support for the assumptions that (1) users holding positive attitudes about a coaudience tend to perceive the mentally construed group as more similar to themselves than users holding a more negative attitude, and (2) attitudes about the coaudience are placed within a framework of related dispositions and thus follow a need to keep the cognitive structure balanced."
2007-0712,Humanitarian Appeals: Promoting Cosmopolitanism or Perpetuating Compassion Fatigue?,The Mediation of Suffering and the Cultivation of Community,,,,Paper,Humanitarian Appeals: Promoting Cosmopolitanism or Perpetuating Compassion Fatigue?,The Mediation of Suffering and the Cultivation of Community,"International aid organizations are generally viewed as cornerstones of the global civil society ideal. Their cause is based on the humanitarian concern for distant Others and their operation is critically dependent on obtaining public support for that cause. This paper investigates the discursive means by which aid organizations mobilize support. It asks whether, in the face of the so-called compassion fatigue, these organizations are able to encourage moral dispositions in the public, to evoke a cosmopolitan sense of responsibility for distant suffering. It examines a number of TV appeals from Red Cross and WFP, looking into the symbolic resources they use to establish relevance, urgency and reliability. I argue that indifference toward distant suffering may not be the inevitable result of compassion overload, but a consequence of how appeals to our conscience fail to establish the necessary conditions of trust, the impression of authenticity, authority and appropriateness in their representations of suffering."
2007-0713,"Human Rights, Global Health, and Journalism",Journalism and Human Rights,,,,Paper,"Human Rights, Global Health, and Journalism",Journalism and Human Rights,"Although rights-based discourses have become ubiquitous during the past decades, journalism remains locked in a conception of human rights as civil and political rights. Recent news coverage of global health issues illustrates the difficulties for journalism to include social rights as part of human rights. For journalism, human rights is both a news subject as well as a news frame. As news subject, human rights is identified with the violation of physical integrity in the hands of states and parastatal groups. Because they do not fit such understanding, the social conditions of global health are rarely covered as human rights stories. As a news frame, human rights narratives are present in health stories about human bodies that are the object of violence perpetrated by other humans. Narratives about womens rights and cultural rights provided by authoritative sources are frequently used to frame such stories. In contrast, the press largely fails to approach health issues such as child and maternal mortality in the global South as human rights issues. Rights discourses about physical violence are not readily applicable to report malnutrition, respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and childbirth complications. Nor are rights narratives used to cover a host of infectious diseases that are responsible for millions of annual deaths. Narratives about infectious diseases typically locate them outside of social conditions and human rights. Instead, they are covered following stock news frames about security, medical triumphs, and the ambiguous results of science to produce a risk-free, controllable reality. It is suggested that these patterns are indicative of broader social difficulties to shift common understandings about human rights and health. It also confirms the parasitic relationship between news narratives and institutionalized discourses. It is argued that journalism has trouble approaching global health as a human rights issue because such framework is largely absent in official sources and institutionalized discourses who typically outline the boundaries for public discussion about global health."
2007-0714,Human-Robot Interaction for Space Exploration,Robots in Human Communication,,,,Paper,Human-Robot Interaction for Space Exploration,Robots in Human Communication,"The interactions between humans and robots during extended space missions will be unlike anything that NASA has designed and implemented to date. The operation of robot teams will at times be directed from ground control. For example, a lunar rover team may be assigned tactical assignments (e.g.
""inspect solar array alpha""). Surface astronauts will also communicate with in-situ robots using voice-based commands, gestures, and wireless digital communication. Rovers, in turn, will communicate with one another for team- based collaboration, and must also develop sufficient self-diagnostic introspection to request human help when appropriate.

Making human-robot interaction (HRI) effective, efficient, and natural is crucial to the success of sustained space exploration. In particular, humans and robots must be able to: (1) communicate clearly about their goals, abilities, plans, and achievements; (2) collaborate to solve problems, especially when situations exceed autonomous capabilities; and (3) interact via multiple modalities (dialogue, gestures, etc.), both locally and remotely.

Since 2005, the Intelligent Robotics Group has been developing tools to support peer-to-peer human-robot interaction. The current system supports multiple humans and robots working in a variety of team configurations.
Humans can collaborate with robots in a shared space, communicating through spoken language dialogue. Robots can be operated in combined teleoperation and autonomous modes of control from Earth or from inside a surface habitat. Coordination between ground control, crew (both EVA and IVA), and mobile robots is performed with the ""Human-Robot Interaction Operating System"" (HRI/OS), an agent-based system that provides a structured framework and variety of interaction services for human-robot teams."

This paper argues that not only did 9/11 not signal the end of the age of irony, as predicted by Roger Rosenblatt in the New York Times, among others, but that the attacks in fact renewed the use of irony as a critical, rhetorical tool. Political cartoons, in addition to often being funny, are a longstanding, but often overlooked, means of identifying political rhetoric that dissimulates. They are, in this sense, a means of exposing lies and contradictions by juxtaposing, visually, metaphorically, and semantically, the inconsistencies in political discourse. Danzigers cartoons following 9/11 have zeroed in on the Bush administrations responses to the attacks by, literally, drawing connections between the Bush and Bin Laden families, between Enron, Halliburton, big oil, the rise in popularity of gas-guzzling Hummer SUVs, and finally the invasion of Iraq. As a Vietnam veteran, Danziger was one of the first pundits to articulate the worrisome, and indeed ironic, parallels between that war and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Using selections from his work over the last five years, this paper argues for the enduringand exigentcriticality of irony and humor in visual culture, especially after 9/11."

2007-0717,Hyperreal Gendering: The End of the Quest for Origins (Top Paper),Caught in the Net: Gender Identity Online,,,,Paper,Hyperreal Gendering: The End of the Quest for Origins (Top Paper),Caught in the Net: Gender Identity Online,"Throughout Judith Butlers works resides a tension regarding the social construction of gender and the idea of originality as it relates to social acceptance. The purpose of this paper is to introduce Judith Butlers construction of gender to the theoretical model known as hyperreality as conceived by sociologist and thinker, Jean Baudrillard. By placing Butler ideas regarding gender within hyperreality, the question of originality becomes moot. Thus, rather than straining under the yoke of correctness, the notion of reality is completely removed from the currently existing gender labels that are applied to individuals. Such a conflation of theoretical constructs reconfigures the hierarchal, value-laden conception of the oppositional and restrictive forces known as masculine and feminine. Instead of a hierarchal order of gender based on preconceived heternormative notions of gender, each gender copy will in itself be primary thereby owing no allegiance to earlier notions."
2007-0718,Hypertextual Thinking in Academic Research,The Web and Academic Research,,,,Work in Progress,Hypertextual Thinking in Academic Research,The Web and Academic Research,"Writing and printing revolutionized the storage and preservation of knowledge. For some authors, they also revolutionized human thinking and memory. The linear nature of these media brought an analytic and logic structure of reasoning. Hypertext is transforming not only the storage and preservation of information, but also the act of reading and manipulating texts. The characteristics of this new medium have potential to cause a new revolution in human thinking from linear to non-linear structures, from hierarchical to flat organizations, from analytic to hypertextual thinking. Empirical evidence of this change toward a more associative and networked thinking can be found in academics, one of the most experienced groups in hypertextual reading. Hypertextual thinking may be tested as levels of interdisciplinary research and networked association patterns, through the use of content analysis and semantic network analysis, respectively."

Analyzing a specific music CD (the 2003 BMG release Normale, an uncharacteristically gypsy-themed and controversial musical statement by the popular Czech rock band Buty) from multiple perspectives (as political text, as the culmination of a set of historically-situated creative processes, and as a cultural commodity) sheds light on some of the dynamics governing contemporary Czech cultural production, illuminating the ways in which commercial logics and institutional imperatives restrain popular musics potential to act as a form of intercultural communication, social critique, or catalyst for social change with regard to the politics of ethnicity."

By synthesizing data from trade journals, news reports, government publications and secondary sources, this paper argues that in the globalization paradigm, the Chinese state actively pursues a nationalist ICT development. Given Chinas status as the potentially largest and most important ICT consumer market for global ICT manufacturers, the nationalist strategy is feasible, because the state maneuvers amidst the fierce competition among transnational players. Internally, the state forms working partnerships with domestic enterprises and uses its monopolistic ownership of the end-user service sector to protect domestic market. Externally, the state adopts a selective FDI policy to facilitate technology transfer and to upgrade the ICT production structure. As the Chinese national development is defined within globalization, developing globally competitive ICT manufacturing capacities is a crucial issue in Chinas globalization strategy."

Using the social marketing framework, we examine case examples from recent tsunami disaster relief efforts in Asia (primarily from Banda Aceh and Tamil Nadu, India) which utilized Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). We draw lessons on how and when ICTs can play a focal role in influencing collective welfare, education levels, livelihood generation activities, sharing health resources, improving mortality and in shaping communal roles. Implications for policy and disaster relief agencies are proposed."

Consequently, the theorized psychological responses to characters are grounded on processes of observation, evaluation (e.g., empathy), and (para-social) dialogue. In this theoretical paper, we argue for the theoretical (e.g., escapism research) and empirical (advent of interactive media) relevance of a nondyadic alternative concept that has already been outlined as identification (e.g., Cohen, 2001; Oatley, 1999). Based on reviews of dyadic and nondyadic approaches to the media user  character relationship, a reformulation of identification is proposed that builds on social psychological research on self-perceptions. Identification with a media character is construed as a temporary alteration of media users self-perception by inclusion of perceived properties of the target media character. Implications for media enjoyment, media effects and the measurement of identification are discussed."
2007-0724,Identification with Victimhood,Trauma and Popular Culture,,,,Paper,Identification with Victimhood,Trauma and Popular Culture,"This article focuses on Gordian knot connecting trauma, violence, and the process of identification with victimhood. My claim is that the mechanism or figure of victim and perpetrator circulates in modernity and fuels new conflict with old antagonisms. I follow the development of this model and show how historical accounts, reflected in popular media, encourage identification with the victim and thus justify, indirectly, extreme acts of retaliation and aggression. I concentrate on two exceptional casesSteven Spielbergs Munich and Hani Abu Assads Paradise Nowwhich deliberately manipulate the model of victimhood so as to expose the underlying trauma that supports it. The two movies bring to light the mutual implication of victim and perpetrator and show that in the Israeli-Palestinian context, the conflict in the public sphere is a conflict over the status of victimhood."

As a result, a majority of corporations within the United States use some form of team structures within their organizations to increase their ability to meet organizational goals. The Team Excellence instrument developed by Larson and LaFasto is a tool used to diagnose the activities of an individual group or an organization related to teamwork practices. This instrument has been administered to more than 5,000 team members within the public and private sectors since 1989. This study attempted to determine if differences exist between public and private sectors in team perceptions of communication, collaborative climate, commitment, goals, team member competence, team standards, team structure, and team leadership. Rasch modeling techniques were used to determine if perceived teamwork differences existed by analyzing each of the 48 individual items of the Team Excellence instrument for the two sectors."

Two newspapers (Shenzhen Special Zone Daily and Shenzhen Evening Post) representing more and less ideological controls were chosen for content analysis in comparing the difference in news coverage, news value and layout. The result indicates that there was no significant difference in news coverage and news value. However, obvious difference was found in layout between newspapers with different ideological controls. Those with stronger control turned out to be more conservative while those with weaker control enjoyed more freedom in design and layout. This confirms that all Chinese newspapers are subjected to some extent of ideological control, yet the forces of censorship are reduced on visual content rather than on verbal ones."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between idiomatic communication and Knapps stages of escalation and deescalation. The results of the study (N = 245) found that couples in deescalation stages utilize fewer idioms than couples in the escalation stages, and escalating and deescalating couples differ in the frequency at which they use idioms. Couples in deescalating stages use confrontational idioms that have more negative effects more often than escalating couples, and men and women differ on their perceptions of two functions: confrontations and requests. Finally, the use of idiomatic communication is significantly related to solidarity, relational satisfaction, and affective orientation."

For this research project 23 face-to-face depth-interviews with female gamers between the ages of 17 and 59 were conducted, and an additional 34 female gamers were interviewed by email. It is concluded that this group of female gamers do not play the game to engage in any form of competition, or to experience arousal, but rather to relax, enjoy the specific challenge of the game and engage in a fantasy-world. Most women have no contact with other female gamers, apart from the women they communicate with online. We have shown that through playing the game a group of participants had learned how to structure information on the computer and look up things on the Internet, and we conclude that playing a videogame can indeed influence someones digital skills. We have demonstrated that with selecting a group of women who play one particular game-title, it is possible to isolate a particular type of female gamer and we may thus conclude that within gaming literature it is no longer feasible to consider women gamers to be a homogenous group."

Data were collected from 2362 first-year college students at a large Northeastern University. Students assessments of the healthiness of their own lifestyles, as well as that of their best friends and the average college student were compared. The majority of students were optimistically biased in comparing their own lifestyles to those of the average college student. Increasing the distance of the comparison target (best friendaverage student) increased the extent of the optimistic bias. Those participants who did not rate their own lifestyle as healthier than that of the average college student, rated their best friends lifestyle as healthier than that of the average student. Body Mass Index influenced ratings of participants own lifestyles in that normal weight participants gave higher ratings than obese participants, but it did not eliminate optimistic bias. Obese and overweight participants still gave higher ratings to their own lifestyle than to those of the average student. Males gave higher ratings than females for their own lifestyle and that of the average student, but gender had not effect on the extent of individuals optimistic bias. Race also influenced optimistic bias assessments, with Asian/Pacific Islanders reporting the least optimistic bias and American Indians the greatest."

Results showed that self-deprecation had a direct effect on source evaluation across national culture. No interaction was found between self-deprecation and source expertise; humble experts were not perceived to have better messages or to be more likable than humble non-experts. Conversational narcissism did not impact participants evaluations of the source or their message and was highest among participants from the U.S. and lowest among Japanese participants."

Using social cognitive theory as the guiding theoretical perspective, the purpose of this paper was to assess the impact of the program through a first-of-its-kind national-level survey that interviewed both caretakers (N = 426) and the target audience of preschoolers (N = 486). This paper also sought to overcome the difficulty inherent in measuring exposure to program content through self-reports obtained from preschoolers. It introduced and tested the efficacy of a parsimonious measure of exposure: childrens recognition of the primary characters of the program. Overall, the models explained as much as 53 percent of the variance in childrens learning; exposure to the program was significantly associated with learning. Furthermore, the parsimonious measure of exposure was as effective as a more elaborate self-reported measure. Relative to these two measures of exposure, caretakers reports of childrens viewing was not as good a predictor of learning."

A pre- and posttest design was used to determine changes in public perceptions and attitudes targeted by the Clear the Smoke campaign. Over 3000 statewide telephone surveys were conducted throughout the baseline and follow-up surveys. The results showed that the campaign achieved the short-term goals of: a) increasing public awareness about the tobacco; and b) increasing public support for the right to breathe clean air. Significant positive movement in 3 long-term goals was also identified: a) perceived importance of tobacco as a public health issue; b) public support for smoke-free public/workplace policies; and c) strengthening social norms in support of a tobacco-free lifestyle. Limitations and implications are discussed.

The findings showed that attraction toward the organization was not affected by the level of severity that the nonsmoking policy would have on ones employment. On the other hand, the amount of the organizations assistance had a main effect on attraction toward the organization. These and other findings are presented in detail, and the implications thereof are discussed."
2007-0738,"Impregnating Images: Visions of Race, Sex and Consumer-Citizenship in Californias Teen Pregnancy Prevention Campaigns",Creating the Neoliberal Subject in Health Communication,,,,Paper,"Impregnating Images: Visions of Race, Sex and Consumer-Citizenship in Californias Teen Pregnancy Prevention Campaigns",Creating the Neoliberal Subject in Health Communication,"Long before teen pregnancy registered on the radars of either legislative or public health institutions in the US, discourses of pregnancy, reproduction, motherhood, and family were already firmly enmeshed with the logics of
racialization and the politics of consumer-citizenship. It is therefore in keeping with a history of nation-building in the image of the white, middle-class consumer-citizen that ""visions"" of teen pregnancy have emerged within public health education initiatives. This paper examines the visual media components of the Californias Department of Health Services
Partnership for Responsible Parenting (1996-2000) for how they ironically managed the racialized threats of immigration and globalization by encouraging profoundly sexualized consumer desires and desirability on the part of their target populations."
2007-0739,Impression Formation and Management in Social Network Websites,"Relationship Articulation and Self-Presentation in Social Network Sites: Friending, Disclosing, and Communicating Online",,,,Paper,Impression Formation and Management in Social Network Websites,"Relationship Articulation and Self-Presentation in Social Network Sites: Friending, Disclosing, and Communicating Online","The production of identity in social network websites is not without context. Depending on a user's social needs, the processes that go into identity formation, and the eventual constructed identity may vary substantially. Understanding how users of social network sites differently project identity at varying social need-states is important as it gives us an empirical look at identity construction, and it provides useful points of comparison for previous survey research.

The Facebook is a social network website (SNS) that helps students negotiate the social world around them. When students arrive on a college campus, they have a strong need to understand and negotiate their new social milieu. The Facebook serves an augmentative role to these students, affording them the ability to privately explore their new social world. To be an active participant in this social world, however, students must also create self-representation of their identity. Therefore, we may be able to elucidate social need-states of population subsets based on levels of identity disclosure.

In this particular research, a complete-network sample of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Facebook (http://facebook.com) is analyzed for levels of identity production by a number of independent variables, such as self-reported school year, relationship status and political orientation. It is hypothesized that students typically in greater social need-states, such as freshmen and students actively seeking dating relationships, will construct a richer representation of their identity than students who aren't in these social need-states. Additionally, exploratory analysis will attempt to identity novel social groups that appear to be in social need-states. The analysis will attempt to provide a link between levels of identity disclosure and social need-state, providing important insight into how social and informational need-states motivate use of social network websites."

According to previous research, self-promotion in response to a question is perceived more positively. The current research claims that people commonly encourage their interactants to ask them a question pertaining to their success and investigates the resulting impressions created. In study 1, speakers were perceived more negatively when they raised the issue relevant to their self-promotion. However, this was the case only when their interactant did not ask them a question concerning their success. In study 2, when the self-promotion followed a question, the speaker was perceived similarly when he asked his interactant the same question and when he did not."

Electronic medical records, videoconferencing for patient visits, and tablet-style computers are capable of bringing information and communication options directly to the patients bedside.

These technologies empower the patient and the provider to make educated, effective decisions. Despite this, implementation presents significant barriers. Creating environments where multiple technologies work together remains an issue in the medical setting, especially as the healthcare industrys technology investment tends to be lower than others. Getting buy-in from individual employees introduces another challenge. With concerns about disruption of work routines and additional training, this key segment of healthcare provision is often left behind.

A number of communication disciplines inform our practical experiences in overcoming these barriers to adoption. This project aims to discuss the application of these lessons and their fit with communication theory."

According to the recently released results of the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, only 20% of people with below basic health literacy and 42% of people with basic health literacy search the Internet for health information. Additional studies show that people cannot find the information they seek on Web sites about 60% of the time and that health content on the Web is often too difficult for the average adult.

This presentation will address some of the challenges people with low health literacy face when searching the Web for health information and ways to address those challenges. Specifically, the presenter will discuss recent research conducted with low literacy users to inform the development of new features for healthfinder.gov, a government resource for finding reliable government and nonprofit health information."

This paper builds on previous research and literature reviews by offering new solutions to problems that have insufficiently been solved: what past interorganizational communication problems should be avoided? What proper collaborative methods should be implemented? How can these methods lead to more rapid communication thanks to the use of electronic equipment? How can risk communication and the media play an important role? To what extent can interdisciplinary research and funding be needed? Another important issue that makes this study unique is the contention that the success of terrorism preparedness in hospitals is contingent upon the development of intraorganizational relationships among hospitals own departments and among hospital units (i.e., surgery unit, geriatrics department). Finally, this paper offers a discussion section and directions for future research."

Absent a perceived motive for deception, people will infer that a message source is honest. As a consequence, confessions should be believed more often than denials, true confessions will be correctly judged as honest, and false confessions will be misjudged. Participants (N = 127) judged true and false confessions and denials in a 2 x 2 experiment. As predicted, confessions were judged as honest more frequency than denials (η2 = .64). Detection accuracy was just above 50% for denials regardless of message veracity, 95% for true confessions, and only 12% for false confessions. These findings document an important exception to 50%+ accuracy conclusion, provide evidence consistent with a projected motive explanation of deception detection, and highlight the importance of the content-in-context in judgmental processes."
2007-0745,In Between the Real and the Reel: the Rise of Mobile Media in the Age of Web 2.0,Viewing/Forming Asia Through Visual Media: From Visual/Cultural Perspective,,,,Paper,In Between the Real and the Reel: the Rise of Mobile Media in the Age of Web 2.0,Viewing/Forming Asia Through Visual Media: From Visual/Cultural Perspective,"Convergence has become part of burgeoning mobile media. The mobile phone has come of age. As a burgeoning component of visual media cultures, camera phone practices are arguably both extending and creating emerging ways of seeing and representing. In media footage of late, camera phones have been heralded as providing everyday users with the possibility of self-expression and voice in the once one-way model of mass media. Building on discourses of analogue photographic practices and a so-called democraticising of photographic media, camera phones are affording users with the ability to document, re-present and perform the everyday. In particular, the exchange and gift-giving economy underpinning mobile phone practices (Taylor and Harper 2003) is further enunciated by the camera phones function to share moments between intimates (and strangers) through various contextual frameworks and archives from MMS, blogs, virtual community sites to actual face-to-face digital storytelling.
But is mobile media really affording new forms of digital storytelling and prosumer (producer plus consumer) agency? Or is it just part of the participatory rhetoric of global telecommunications? This paper will draw on emerging forms of micromovie making and such practices as camera phone in order to discuss visuality in the age of what Robert Luke dubs the phoneur (2005)."

A Case Study on the Appropriation of the Promise (Wu Ji),Emerging Issues in Chinese Media,"Applying de Certeaus theory of strategy and tactic as well as Hebdiges incorporation model in Culture Studies, this case study examines an appropriation of a 2005 Chinese film the Promise. The major argument is that the Promise is a strategy in the sense that it postulates a place upon which it delimits itself from others and defines properness. The parody of it (Mantou) is a resistant tactic in the fact that it 1) is an appropriation of the Promise, a property that belongs to others; 2) threatens the pervasive power of the Promise in the market by successfully creating its own distribution channels; 3) subverted the original meaning in the Promise through satires of real world problems. Exploring the relationship between the resistance of the parody and the incorporation by the mainstream film industry, the study suggests that incorporation is not the unavoidable fate of resistance; rather, between the 2 there is always a negotiation, through which both resistance and incorporation has loss and gains. The study therefore calls for a more dialectic and dynamic approach in examining cultural resistance and incorporation."

Go Sun Smart (GSS) is a theory-based, multichannel health communication program designed to influence sun protection attitudes and behaviors of employees and guests at high altitude ski resorts in order to reduce their risk for skin cancer. This paper reports the results of analyses on sun safety by guests. GSS, based primarily on Diffusion of Innovation Theory, was evaluated in a pair-matched, group-randomized, pretest-posttest controlled design at 26 ski areas in Western North America. GSS increased guests exposure to sun safety messages with guests at the intervention resorts significantly more likely to recall hearing or seeing a message about sun protection than those at control resorts. Guests with higher skiing/snowboarding expertise, who spent more days skiing/snowboarding on the mountain, and were older were more likely to recall seeing or hearing a message. Further, guests at intervention ski resorts recalling a sun safety message were statistically significantly more likely to report using sunscreen, sunscreen and sunscreen lip balm combined, and receiving fewer sunburns while skiing or snowboarding that winter than guests at intervention ski areas not recalling a message and than guests at control ski areas providing further support for the effectiveness of exposure to GSS materials."

2007-0749,Individual-Level and Network-Level Explanations of Organizational Unit Communication Effectiveness,Making Sense of Networks,,,,Paper,Individual-Level and Network-Level Explanations of Organizational Unit Communication Effectiveness,Making Sense of Networks,"This study assesses primary influences (communication frequency, purpose of the communication, primary medium, reason for using that medium, preferred medium, distance, and network location) on unit effectiveness (timeliness and effectiveness), at both individual and unit-network levels of analysis. E-mail is the primary channel of communication used, followed by face-to-face, telephone and meetings. At an individual-level, regression analysis shows that e-mail as a primary medium is negatively, distance as a cause of using the primary medium is negatively, and ease of use as a cause of using the primary medium is positively related to average unit communication effectiveness. At a unit-network level, multiple matrix regression analysis shows that communication frequency, sharing, coordination, ease, content, and redundancy significantly explain specific unit communication effectiveness. The primary conceptual and methodological conclusion is that unit-network-level analysis provides both greater statistical and substantive explanation of organizational communication effectiveness than does traditional individual-level analysis."

It has been estimated that 80% of college students drink, with 40% routinely engage in ""binge"" drinking, despite widespread exposure to behavioral interventions through both the mass media and school-based programs. This study explores the possibility that individual personality differences moderate perceptions of binge drinking, receptivity to alcohol messages, and, consequently, the potential efficacy of behavioral interventions. Extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism personality dimensions are seen as cognitive heuristics of social self-efficacy differentiating individuals sensitivity to social norms and perceptions of alcohol consumption and binge drinking."

The relationship is explored between tanning behavior and other psychosocial variables including sensation seeking, self-esteem, tanning beliefs, friends tanning bed use and acquaintance tanning bed use. Undergraduate students (N = 744) at a large northeastern university participated in the study. The results indicate that all three personality system, perceived environmental system and behavior system predicted past tanning bed use and intention to use tanning beds. In addition, there was a positive association between sensation seeking and intention to tan. Tanning beliefs were also positively associated with both past tanning behavior and intention to tan. Implications of these findings are discussed."
2007-0752,Influence of Source Liking and Personality Traits on Perceptions of Bias and News Source Selection,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Influence of Source Liking and Personality Traits on Perceptions of Bias and News Source Selection,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,This study examined news selection intentions that followed judgments of story bias and the extent to which those intentions were influenced by source liking. The study also examined the extent to which 2 personality traits -- argumentativeness and need for cognition  affected perceptions of story bias and intent to select an offending source in the future. Participants were more likely to say they would return to the source of a biased story if they liked and had selected the source previously than they were if the source was unknown. Individuals high in argumentativeness were less likely than those low in argumentativeness to view a story with negative information about their group as biased. Need for cognition was not consistently or strongly related to intent to return to an offending source. Implications for consumption of counterattitudinal information and source selection in the current news environment are discussed.
2007-0753,Influencing Communications Policy With Software Defaults,Where Does Code End and the State Begin?,,,,Paper,Influencing Communications Policy With Software Defaults,Where Does Code End and the State Begin?,"Scholars and policymakers are increasingly considering the use of software and its influence on societal concerns such as privacy, freedom of speech, and intellectual property protection. A necessary step in this process is deciding what the settings should be for the relevant software. In this paper, we build upon work in computer science, behavioral economics, and legal scholarship to establish a well-defined framework for how default settings in software should be determined.
The framework considers how defaults should be set to enhance societal welfare. These recommendations are illustrated with examples implicating security and privacy. This normative approach towards utilizing the architecture of communication technology stands apart from most previous scholarship, which focuses on the effects of technology. Ultimately, this research shows that the manipulation of software is a useful complement to traditional policy tools."
2007-0754,Information,formation and Meaning: A Dialogue,,,,Paper,Information,Information and Meaning: A Dialogue,"Much contemporary communication research stands on the shoulders of three mathematical theories: the logical, statistical, and algorithmic theories of information. Logical theory concerns distinctions and selections among logical possibilities. As such, it addresses a semantic space of possible realities. Statistical theory concerns observed probabilities, and is familiar from Claude Shannons theory of communication. Algorithmic theory concerns the information that is required to compute a function or problem (i.e., some software requires more memory than others). Each of these theories center on the distinctions (possibilities, probabilities, and length of instructions) which, from the human perspective, give rise to meaning. The translation of distinguishable signals into informative messages depends on at least three aspects of their context: (i) temporality (e.g., a comprehensible sequence); (ii) rules (e.g., situational constraints); (iii) a history of relationships between senders and receivers; and (iv) the known intentions of senders and needs of receivers."

A content analysis examined the framing of Chinese news stories related to SARS from a commercial China-based web portal, a national newspaper and a regional newspaper. 727 news stories during the SARS outbreak were content analyzed for the presence of five previously identified news frames (Health Severity, Human Interest, Economic, Attribution of Responsibility, Denial) and for the type of cited sources (domestic and international). MANOVA analyses indicated that the national newspaper used the Health Severity frame more often than the regional newspaper. The China-based web portal used the Economic frame significantly more often than either newspapers. News articles posted on the China-based web portal also included significantly more international sources than either newspapers. Results are discussed in terms of the future of the Internet in China as a tool to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases through rapid information dissemination via the Internet."

The study found exposure to diverse opinions and experience in expressing opinions in the Internet to be related to likelihood of expressing deviance in public. The study also identified several significant predictors of likelihood of expressing deviance in the Internet and in public. Although perceived risk of expressing deviant views in the Internet was lower than that in public, the respondents were more likely to express deviant views in public than in the Internet. The level of moral implications in topics of discussion was found to be negatively related to likelihood of expressing deviance in the Internet and in public."
2007-0757,Information Overload Within Organizational Settings: Exploring the Causes of Overload,Knowledge and Knowing in Organizations,,,,Paper,Information Overload Within Organizational Settings: Exploring the Causes of Overload,Knowledge and Knowing in Organizations,"This paper develops a conceptual framework of causes of information overload within organizational settings. The framework is based on the premise that the information load can be considered as the major cause of information overload. However, the load itself will not cause information overload, but the perception of the information load will. The framework proposes a number of factors that may determine information overload, including individual, organization, task and information characteristics. The conceptual framework draws on a previously developed model of causes of overload (Eppler & Mengis, 2004), and is extended with the findings of one case study. The potential advantage is that the conceptual framework provides a more complete picture of the determinants of information overload than has been provided by other frameworks. The conceptual framework is hopefully one that can guide and advance future research on causes of information overload."

The focus of this research is to examine workplace safety using health communication theory and research. Based on individuals risk perception and efficacy beliefs, a field study using a random sample of production workers (n=645) in a manufacturing organization was conducted in order to validate the predictions of the risk perception attitude framework. Results were consistent with the theory, as risk and efficacy jointly predicted safety behavior, behavioral intentions, and safety information-seeking intentions. Given a particular level of risk, those with greater efficacy beliefs displayed more positive safety outcomes than those with lower efficacy beliefs. The responsive group (high risk, high efficacy) reported safer outcomes than the avoidance group (high risk, low efficacy) and the proactive group (low risk, high efficacy) reported safer outcomes than the indifference group (low risk, low efficacy). This theoretical frame provides practical directions as to what shapes the safety behaviors and communication patterns of workers in dangerous jobs and offers insights for safety information seeking and workplace safety."

Some believe that Wikipedia can be a powerful tool for information dissemination. Others contest that Wikipedia has the potential to damage participants information literacy skills. However, little or no research has been done to ascertain how digital youth participants understand or cognitively process the information they find on this collaboratively written site. The present research examines how digital youth understand, create, and valorize information on Wikipedia. The work sheds light on the processes through which digital youth evaluate Wikipedia entries compared to other digital information, as well as how taking part in Wikipedia changes participants level of trust in Wikipedia entries veracity. Further, it analyses how passive information and active information production create different understandings of collaborative communities in terms of information literacy.

Laura Robinson is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the USC Annenberg Center for Communication, working on the digital youth research project. Her areas of specialization include the comparative study of online communities and computer-mediated communication to advance the understanding of the comparative cultural use of new media and digital peer-to-peer networks. She has published articles on online communities such as eBay, SAG and Napster in journals including The Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication and Qualitative Sociology."

Overall, 27 web sites were analyzed at 3 stages of the campaign with a coding scheme that featured 79 categories, partially derived from the existing literature and partially introduced anew to measure recent emerging phenomena. Parties online efforts were scrutinized along three main lines of inquiry: information tools, participation tools, and professionalism. Results show that Italian national parties have reached a good proficiency level in terms of informing their online users and in adapting quite sophisticated production techniques, but still leave much to be desired in terms of maximizing the internets potential for participation and mobilization. Hypotheses of normalization and meritocracy in cyberspace are also tested, providing support for both theories."

Researchers are testing the possibility that information processing dimensions might be helpful in explaining why the education level of audiences is associated with variance in knowledge acquisition from media. The experiment reported here contributes to this endeavor by testing the interaction of media channels (television, newspaper, web) and time delay with the education level of audience members, using three memory measures. Results show that the lower education group encoded, stored, and retrieved news information presented in the television format best while they have considerably less capacity to remember information from newspaper and web versions of stories. The higher education group showed the opposite pattern in that they perform better in memory tests with newspaper and web versions of stories compared to television. With time delay these patterns hold up. They were also robust when controlling for subject evaluations of the news stories in terms of interest, informativeness, and understandability."

We review and critique current HIV test counseling research and practice and propose a reframing of the current HIV test counseling protocol with a model informed by Harm Reduction Theory (HRT). The Integrated Model for Voluntary Counseling and Testing is based, in part, on transcripts from HIV test counseling sessions that suggested a need for movement away from traditional approaches of counselor-to-client interviewing in favor of more realistic, nonjudgmental, agency-promoting, client-involved, collaborative sessions promoting sexual health and HIV/AIDS prevention for clients and others who share their lives. In addition, the authors recognize the limitations of this extension of HRT into HIV test counseling practice and training and include future directions for implementation and evaluation."

First, I explicate how scholars have engaged with issues of access in publics, focusing in particular on feminist critiques of access to publics. Next, using asylum seeker claims for access to U.S. publics, in particular those claiming asylum for reasons of gender and sexual orientation persecution, I illuminate how (in)hospitality might work as a modality to articulate what happens around, through, and beyond publics. I posit that current logics of global capital flows condition access to publics through the following lines: First, guests are intelligible in their relation to global capital along lines of productivity. Second, guests become intelligible in their relations as gifts either to the host or to the home. While I use asylum seekers to theorize here, I conclude with implications for other guests seeking access in U.S. publics."

A systematic random sample of 518 Colorado State University freshmen was sent a mail survey on personal alcohol use, perceptions of peer alcohol norms, and awareness of alcohol education campaigns on campus in the spring of 2006. The study found that participants overestimated peer alcohol use and peer permissiveness of alcohol use. Participants self-reported drinking rates positively correlated more with misperceptions of peer descriptive alcohol norms than their misperceptions of peer injunctive alcohol norms; however, all correlations were weak. Female participants had stronger positive correlations between self-reported drinking rates and misperceptions of peer descriptive alcohol norms than did male participants. Neither male nor female participants were highly aware of 4 out of 5 alcohol education campaigns on campus. The findings suggest that social norms campaigns might not be successful in lowering drinking rates among participants due to their low campaign awareness and low correlations between drinking rates and social alcohol norms. More research is needed to reexamine possible gender differences in the effects of descriptive and injunctive alcohol norms on college drinking rates."

Since fall, 2005, we have collected almost 1,800 survey responses and conducted more than 60 interviews with viewers of at least one of these shows. The data presented here concern audiences conceptions of the inner and outer self and the relations between these. Viewers frequently express a reflexive process of transformation, when inner change prompts external change, and vice versa. In most cases, however, viewers assume that there must be congruence between the inner and outer self, and that congruence is evidence of authentic and lasting change. The paper considers how makeover shows encourage candidates to change in line with dominant social norms, and how they interject commercial appeals into the processes of change. It concludes with an engagement with post-structuralist gender, queer, and transgender theory to investigate the usefulness of these approaches to the body for the analysis of makeover audience responses."

Of particular interest is the differential impact of the institutional environment on the newspaper industry. This study takes advantages of heterogeneity across countries in their government policies toward the newspaper industry to examine whether the differences in the policies or regulations differentially affect the market structure of the industry. Countries with horizontal concentration limits have a larger number of national and local newspaper titles than do countries without such regulations. Countries with entry regulations have a fewer number of local newspaper titles than do countries without the regulations. Countries with foreign ownership limitations have a larger number of local newspaper titles than do countries without the regulations. Interestingly, this study found no significant effect of government subsidies on the structure of the newspaper industry."

The paper proposes an integrated approach to development communication that is based on four dimensions of public relationsasymmetry versus symmetry, one-way versus two-way communication, mediated versus interpersonal communication, and communication ethics. The paper suggests that a contextually based application of the four dimensions helps in overcoming weaknesses related to the currently dominant development communication approachesdiffusion of innovations and participatory communication."

This paper examines in detail Bop-TVs programming practices in order to demonstrate that the industrial uses of imported programs are deeply embedded in the political and cultural landscape of the importing nation. While the historical conditions under which Bop-TV fashioned its programming practices make them particularly political, all such practices are political because they involve imagining the audience in particular ways rather than others. Indeed, if we fully account for the cultural significance of scheduling in specific locations and historical moments, conventional data about international program flows becomes as imprecise for comprehending the impact of imports on television markets as ratings data are for understanding the influence of imported television shows on viewers."

Conducted in 2 contrasting cultures, this cross-sectional research consisted of two phases: the TPB elicitation research and the main study. Participants were undergraduate students recruited from 2 major public universities in Thailand and the U.S. The sample size used in the main analysis comprised 417 respondents from Thailand (representing a collectivistic society) and 432 respondents from the U.S. (representing an individualistic society). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to investigate the predictability of the integrated model. Multigroup SEM was implemented to examine the moderating effects of I-C. The results yielded some significant findings enhancing our understanding of paper-recycling intentions of college students in the 2 countries. First, TPB determinants, especially PBC and SN, were potential predictors of paper recycling. Although ATT was not a successful antecedent of paper-recycling intentions in Thailand, it predicted intentions of U.S. participants. Second, altruism was a significant factor explaining ATT and PBC for both samples; it also directly influenced intentions. Finally, 2 types of self-construal significantly and distinctively affected ATT and SN. Findings can benefit communication campaigns targeting audiences in different cultural milieus."

Growing evidence of perceptual, cognitive, and social benefits of playing commercial games furthers our hopes for games made specifically for learning. However, as learning games are emerging as a new educational tool, they still suffer from the same weakness that other media have: a lack of individualized aid that comes from one-on-one instruction. Games have the potential to offer engaging, interactive experiences that can be tailored to students needs in terms of both entertainment and education. Techniques from intelligent tutoring systems can be innovatively used to adapt a game to student needs along different dimensions (e.g. altering game objects, changing character behaviors, generating story content, or providing in-game guidance for problem-solving), creating an intelligent tutoring game. Intelligent tutoring games can provide the connection between modern computer-based education and the growing field of digital game-based learning."

Outcomes were measures of knowledge, self-efficacy, behavior, and clinical outcomes. 4 potential moderators were also examined: nature of interactivity (video games vs. information programs), nature of comparison intervention (type of control group used), health condition type (type of behavior that the health condition required: prevention or management), and age of the participant. Health-related IM interventions were effective; effect sizes were significantly greater than 0 for all outcome measures. Fixed and mixed effects regression models were used for each meta-analysis (1 meta-analysis per outcome measure). Both models revealed that the Information Programs imparted significantly more knowledge than Video Games, that older participants gained significantly more self-efficacy than younger participants, and that health interventions advocating management behavior were significantly more efficacious than those advocating prevention behavior."

A serious video game was custom build as a tool to facilitate learning about physiological processes in the human body. The study faces the methodological challenge of controlling individualized content in interactive media usage: A matched pair design was applied in which subjects either played a video game or watched a replay of the same. 30 pairs of subjects were matched according to age, sex, video game literacy, interest and expertise in the area of content. Dependent measures include presence and enjoyment while controlling for usability and academic achievement in the area of interest. Pre-post comparisons are presented and discussed regarding the role of interactivity for enjoyment in educational game play. Furthermore, the role of presence and enjoyment as mediators for learning will be explored.

This paper reports on the development and testing of brief scales to assess the two concepts, and on a test of them with participants in six conditions of a large-scale trial of interventions for breast cancer patients. Overall, the Internet scored very low on both measures. Versions of an integrated system of services scored higher, particularly as conditions added features to different versions of the system. Interventions involving a human Cancer Information Mentor scored highest, though even the Mentor was perceived as more Interactive and having more Presence when combined with the integrated eHealth system."

This study focused specifically on how trainers and trainees interact in the mediated learning environment of a Web conference. Relying on learning theoretical perspectives and the role of interactivity, this 2X2 design tested the effect of two types of interactivity: trainer-controlled and trainee-controlled. We examined outcomes relevant to the traineei.e. learning and satisfaction, and relevant to the traineri.e. trainer credibility. The findings indicate that the outcome benefiting most from high levels of interactivity is credibility. Furthermore, the goodwill dimension of credibility is affected by high levels of both types of interactivity with trainer-controlled interactivity accounting for 22% of the variance in goodwill and trainee-controlled interactivity accounting for 6%. Implications for e-learning and e-presenting are also discussed."

Le pouvoir inquisitorial est le fondement essentiel du pouvoir régalien de contrôle de la légalité. Consubstantielle au développement de lEtat-Nation, lautorité judiciaire se fonde sur le passage dune justice tribale, basée sur le flagrant délit et le duel, à une justice instituée, capable de réinvoquer lacte par lenquête (Foucault , 1994). La question de la carte nationale didentité électronique peut être éclairer alors comme le point nodal de rencontre entre la longue évolution dun dispositif de gouvernementalité de la population (et des individus), le pouvoir inquisitorial et lémergence dune nouvelle forme despace public médiatisé : Internet. Dans le cadre dune recherche en science de linformation et de la communication , nous avons tenté de suivre la construction des politiques publiques des NTIC en France sur ces dix dernières années au regard dune rationalité de lEtat moderne en butte aux nouvelles opportunités dune mise en réseau des groupes sociaux. Plus de deux décennies après la loi Safari, enterrée par la loi informatique et libertés de 1978, après la première tentative de la carte didentité électronique abandonnée à larrivée des socialistes au pouvoir en 1981, la CNIE semble réactiver les projets de perfectionnement du ministère de lintérieur de sa capacité denquête sur le territoire national. Pour autant, lhistoire ne se répète jamais. Sil nous faut saisir la spécificité du débat actuel et des enjeux quil soulève, nous ne pouvons que revenir sur les modes de problématisation qui ont présidé à la question de la régulation de lInternet par le contrôle de lidentité. Face à ce qui sest élaboré comme une nouvelle modalité de la délinquance moderne, lEtat souhaite y opposer un renforcement de ses dispositifs de pouvoir actualisés par les nouvelles technologies. Pour autant, ce renforcement nest pas un simple accroissement de moyens ou de degrés mais une remise en cause radicale du « compromis de 78 »."

A thorough review of the communication-studies literature revealed few research studies on the topic. To help fill a troubling gap in intercultural communication research, this paper reports on findings centered on the challenges experienced by White teachers when working with their American Indian partners at an urban K-5 public school in western Montana. Communication challenges included perception of time, meaning of schedules, (in)directness in expressing bad news, the organizational pattern of verbal codes, presentational style, and interpretation of relational terms. Although English was the lingua franca, differences between the White teachers communication style and that of their Indian partners adversely impacted the collaboration process. Awareness of cultural meanings behind use of the shared language will help improve Indian/White relations in the K-5 public-school context."

2007-0778,Intercultural Personhood: Globalization and a Way of Being,Highly Ranked Competitive Papers in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,Intercultural Personhood: Globalization and a Way of Being,Highly Ranked Competitive Papers in Intercultural Communication,"This theoretical essay proposes and makes a case for a model of intercultural personhood as an increasingly viable and visible form of human development in the integrated world of tomorrow. The term ""intercultural identity"" is employed as a counterpoint to and extension of cultural identity, highlighting the phenomenon of identity transformation beyond the perimeters of the conventional, monolithic conception of cultural identity. This essay challenges the categorical, static, and value-laden perspectives on cultural identity prevalent in social science literature. An alternative approach is proposed emphasizing the complex and evolving nature of identity. Kims (1988, 2001, 2005a) theory of cross-cultural adaptation provides the basis for describing the identity development process in terms of the interplay of acculturation and deculturation and the stress-adaptation-growth dynamic. Through prolonged and cumulative intercultural communication experiences, the author argues that individuals can undergo a gradual and largely imperceptible identity transformation, with an increasingly individuated and universalized self-other orientation. This process of identity development and its emergent profile of intercultural personhood are illustrated based on available research evidence and from a number of personal testimonials and biographic stories."
2007-0779,Intergroup Bias in Mass Media: From Semantic to Pragmatic Dimensions  A Research Agenda,Approaches to Intergroup Bias,,,,Work in Progress,Intergroup Bias in Mass Media: From Semantic to Pragmatic Dimensions  A Research Agenda,Approaches to Intergroup Bias,"The Linguistic Intergroup Bias (LIB) is defined as the tendency to describe positive ingroup and negative outgroup behaviors in more abstract linguistic categories than negative ingroup and positive outgroup behavior (Fiedler, Bluemke, Friese & Hofmann, 2003). It leads to a more abstract linguistic representation of undesirable aspects compared to desirable ones in describing outgroups and vice versa for the ingroup. The effects are more stable attributions of negative aspects regarding the outgroup thus reinforcing stereotypes. So far, the LIB has mostly been investigated in limited experimental contexts. Although research on mass communication has investigated the medias role in Intergroup conflict for long, there have rarely been attempts to merge these 2 lines of research. Consequently, this paper presents an integrative research agenda for the investigation of Intergroup bias in mass media and postulates 5 hypotheses in conclusion. The research agenda is twofold: (1) It encompasses the analysis of Semantic as well as Pragmatic Intergroup Bias in mass media and (2) Examines the effects this coverage has on the recipients and their judgments. For the first time, Intergroup Bias is studied on different language levels and in different media types and formats. We postulate that it is promising to go beyond semantic categories when analyzing Intergroup conflict in mass media and that it is necessary to take into account visual information as well. A thorough analysis of the methods used as well as preliminary evidence for the hypotheses is presented."

While television is still commonly cited as the key source of news for the general public, the ongoing digitization and networking of the media system has challenged the notion that, at any given time, one news medium will be dominant. I shall discuss the news genre as an intermedial, intertextual, and interactive phenomenon  before, during, and after the television age. What may become the Internet age represents an opportunity for research to reconsider news as a source of information, a practice of communication, as well as a resource for action across media forms."

Gatekeeping theory serves as the theoretical rationale for this study. The findings show that, in terms of event attributes, terror acts committed by domestic separatists were covered more prominently than those with transnational perpetrators in both countries. With regard to content attributes, the number of information sources used in news stories was a significant predictor of coverage prominence for both the U.S. and Chinese newspapers, while the attribution of responsibility only exerted significant influence on the coverage prominence in the U.S. newspapers."
2007-0783,"International Treaties, Art, and the Informational State",tate & Systems,,,,Paper,"International Treaties, Art, and the Informational State",State & Systems,"The transfer of art across state borders often translates political meaning into cultural forms and, conversely, translates cultural expressions into political communication. When forced, such transfers accompany changes in political relationships among states, whether as a result of imperial activity or of war. Even when not forced, such transfers can acquire political gravitas post hoc as a result of changing political or economic conditions. The refusal to permit the transfer of artworks among states is an important means of establishing political autonomy or protecting specific political values. Promoting the transfers of artworks and artists among states is viewed as a type of public diplomacy that is intended to carry with it political influence. Even the concept of citizenship has occasionally undergone translation in order to stake a national claim to  or to deny any relationship to  particular types of artistic work. Increasingly, artworks and artists are used to effect power relations, to represent power relations, and as a venue for conflicts over power among states. The study reported on in this paper explores the many types of translations between art and political power that have resulted from the application of international treaties since 1990. Such interactions make clear the role of the arts and the rhetoric of the structure of the global art market as forms of political communication of great importance during a period in which, as Immanuel Wallerstein has reminded us, culture is the global battleground of the world system."

This paper argues that, even though the Internet could facilitate the formation of public opinion, the orchestration of popular political movements and the production of a transnational public sphere, it does not necessarily mean a promotion to the growth of domestic civil society in Mainland China. This contradiction exists because the crucial element underlying all these popular political communication is nationalism, which is indeed a double-edged sword to the Communist Party. The fact that the survivability of public opinion and popular nationalism can only exist when it is aligned with the interest of the state strongly demonstrates the function of the Internet as a state activation apparatus in online international political communicationa device by which the PRC government can employ to activate or make use of what is activated by the citizens through the medium of the internet to advance national interest in the international arena."

For example, problems exist in government due to inefficient communication, on the other hand, my country faces a great crisis in education and the same is one of the roots of the problem. This very moment, while we speak, some company in the world is spending millions of dollars in consultancy to solve its communication troubles.

What happens in countries like mine, where spending on communication problems is a luxury. As organizations grow, they seek interim solutions to possible problems, and this leads to a snow ball effect. A small unresolved communication problem becomes impossible to solve with time.

Lets accept that it is unreasonable for a small business - one in which even expenses of a few hundred dollars are cause for worry - to spend thousand in professional consultancy fees. There are public service institutions, with great outlook, which survive on charity and could never invest great sums of money in any way of advertising. But the problem is not only monetary, but it is also due to knowledge. Many organizations are unaware or chose to ignore the importance of effective communication. Thankfully alongside these problems a great tool has arisen, and this tool is the Internet.

As communicators we must understand the Internet is more than a technological phenomenon, it is a social phenomenon and in that sense it is a subject for our study. The internet has become in a great opportunity and it is in our hands to make it an affordable tool for massive communication.

The numbers speak for themselves; the growth of the Internet in Latin America is exponential. We still have time to develop a digital culture which allows improved communication in every aspect covered by the net. This is our responsibility as communicators.

In the present there are tools in the net which can have very interesting uses. There are an increasing number of companies which have left the FAQ model for the Wiki model. They have swapped a vertical and unidirectional model to cooperative model where the end user is the one directly participating in clearing up doubts or to bring information. What would happen if we used the Wiki model in educational or government institutions?

The Wiki is a tool and we are the ones to make it effective. Thousand of bureaucratic working hours could be saved if a Wiki community provided the answers to the real questions the public asks.

On the other hand, how many of us have heard of blogs? There are diverse views; many forums have been created to discuss whether it is a new face of modern journalism. Nevertheless it is clear it is a very powerful communication tool.

What would happen if we used the blog model in schools and colleges? This is already happening. The teacher can further explore topics covered in class and promote on-line discussions on academic subjects."

Our paper seeks to understand what attributes of e-Choupal encourage or hinder its adoption, and what economic and social consequences result from its adoption. A random sample survey of 225 e-Choupal users from three districts in the State of Madhya Pradesh, and several in-depth and focus group interviews with adopters and non-adopters points out the sanchalaks (change agents) central role in accelerating the diffusion process.

Overall, the findings of the study supported the proposed model and suggested that individual differences, Internet motives, Internet use contributed to predicting adaptation. In particular, I found that all 3 categories of antecedents influenced Chinese students psychological adaptation. However, only individual difference and Internet motives were found to have an impact on sociocultural adaptation.

The news media often play a significant role in the construction of icons. This paper therefore examined Time and Newsweek representations of Angela Davis, whose iconic status in the turbulent America of the 1960s and 1970s, has served to underline the hegemonic authority of the state, in an attempt to describe relations of power. A critical discourse analysis of 23 articles from the two magazines revealed three key themes: Physicality: Turning to the Jezebel, Brothers and Angela: Passion and Ardor and Passion as Sex. Using these themes, this analysis argues that through their generic practices of framing news events in a dramatic form and their emphasis on interpreting the news for a middle class readership, Time and Newsweek drew on a cultural archive of symbols that have served to define the black woman in America in distinctly racialized and sexualized ways and served therefore to undermine the radical politics of Angela Davis."

There has, however, been little research examining contextual factors that influence reactions to antismoking ads, such as the program context in which ads are viewed. Recent advertising research indicates advertising may be negatively influenced if it interrupts a transportation experience. Transportation may be more likely to occur during programs that have strong narrative story lines, such as dramas, soaps and comedies, than during reality, game show and light entertainment programs. We aimed to explore the influence of narrative versus nonnarrative programs on smokers reactions to 2 new emotive antismoking ads, using a natural exposure methodology. In preexposure interviews, daily smokers (n=779) were asked to watch a particular television program they usually watched. Postexposure interviews examining recall and responses to the ads were conducted within 3 days of exposure. Overall, results indicate placing an emotive antismoking ad within a program in which the viewer is focused on the narrative flow of a story may lead to reduced immediate impact of the ad, especially among those for whom the ad is most relevant, such as those who are preparing to quit smoking. Placing antismoking advertising in reality television, game shows and light entertainment programs may make scarce public health dollars go further, as long as these types of programs are able to reach at least equal numbers of smokers as dramas, soaps, and comedies."

The storylines of these dramas are centered on the domestic conflicts in which, in most of the cases, urban people are involved; the themes of the stories are mainly about living struggles and ethical issues concerning urban families. The issues of the Chinese family-morality television drama as a particular television genre should be discussed with regard to the tremendous social changes and the rapid development of the mass media in contemporary China. The author argues that since the dramas are playing a significant role in sending political messages to the general public, they remain very serious business--culturally, ideologically and politically. This paper is focused on the visualization of women in the contemporary Chinese family-morality television drama texts. In order to reveal the ideological factors behind the representation of the women in the drama texts, the paper analyzes the narrative and textual practices that make the representation possible. By doing so, the paper tries to answer three central questions: First, how are women addressed in the televisual order of the contemporary Chinese sexual politics? Second, how are the womens subjectivities on screen influenced by the discursive patriarchal and family idealism in contemporary China? And last, what is the relationship between the representation of women and the representation of the Chinese national identities?"

How do individuals emotion regulation tendencies interact with these mood-specific media choices? The present research indicates that individuals induced into a somber mood are less receptive to slapstick comedies but more receptive to social dramas and dark comedies than individuals induced into a happy mood. Although emotion regulation difficulty did not moderate the impact of mood on media preferences, a retrospective questionnaire indicates that increased difficulty regulating negative emotion is associated with an increased tendency to transport into media programs, as well as increased preference for bad mood congruent media. Gender differences are also obtained in both studies; women were more likely to prefer dramas and romance-themed media, regardless of mood. Results are discussed as a function of cognitive and emotional receptivity to media and the potential impact of such exposure."

This presumption deserves clarification: What is so special about small states? The presentation will first touch upon their structural peculiarities. They result in a high penetration with foreign media and makes the operation of domestic media organizations more difficult (in some countries intensified by sharing the same language with next door giant neighbors). Some characteristics of European small states will be illustrated with empirical data. Thereafter, the presentation will focus on potential effects of state size on media regulation. There exist several possibilities to foster diversity on the level of media structure and media content. However, it will be hypothesized that media diversity as a goal of media regulation has less political relevance than to safeguard local media culture against foreign media companies. Altogether, the presentation will provide the panels framework and will ensure the compatibility of subsequent presentations."

Beginning with his coining of the word truthiness and culminating in a blistering speech at the White House Correspondents Dinner, Stephen Colbert has not only proven that irony did not die in the ashes of the World Trade Center, but has, in fact, become an essential weapon through which to critique the politics and policies of the post 9/11 world. This paper argues that The Colbert Report relies for its existence, humor, and political poignancy on the context of the post-9/11 political landscape. It is ironic that the attacks that reintroduced the rhetoric of good vs. evil and a political response reminiscent of the crusades became both a Baudrillardian absolute event and an atmosphere capable of giving birth to Stephen Colberts unabashedly and unapologetically postmodern performance. In order to fully understand the role of irony in the post 9/11 world, this paper argues, we need to examine how one of its most shining examples straddles the boundary between modern and postmodern narratives and social conditions, resulting in an anarchically playful sensibility with remarkable cultural capital."

Using this example as a starting point, the paper explored the use of Jeremy Benthams Panopticon metaphor in the current study of surveillance. Most of the scholarly works reviewed used the Foucauldian model of power, premising on the assumption of the Big Brother keeping a constant watch on the people. However, it became obvious that the use of new mobile technology, that assumption does not fall strictly into the traditional notion of the panoptic gaze. Instead of a top-down surveillance structure, the example offered the possibility of a bottom-up surveillance, that is, the people doing the surveillance on the Big Brother. This paper proposes an Inverted Panopticon as a more accurate description of phenomenon."

A national probability sample of 2,226 adults aged 40-70 were surveyed and the results offer partial support of RPA framework predictions. Overall, although an interaction effect was found between risk and efficacy on some outcomes, the nature of these interaction effects were not entirely consistent with the RPA framework. The findings have implications for health campaigns, particularly the need to increase efficacy beliefs about reducing cancer risks within the general population."

I posit that the availability of a new technology opens the possibility for a new mode of information  a new relationship among producers and audience, including a redefinition of who is producer and who is audience. As the new technology becomes more established, I argue, that potential becomes circumscribed, both through professionalization and a conscious effort by dominant groups to control the emerging medium and establish a mode of information that favors their continued domination."

Just over a third of the respondents reported that for various reasons they did not form impressions of their online teammates. However, as predicted by Social Information Processing theory, the majority of the respondents drew upon a variety of cues present in their online interactions to create impressions of their virtual teammates. As one survey respondent remarked so succinctly, Based on chat threads, I picture short sentences coming from short people."
2007-0804,I Saw This Person: Use and Suppression of Gendered Pronouns in Talk About Drag Queens,"Little Words, Big Results: How Single Words Accomplish Action in Conversation",,,,Paper,I Saw This Person: Use and Suppression of Gendered Pronouns in Talk About Drag Queens,"Little Words, Big Results: How Single Words Accomplish Action in Conversation","Pronouns are small words that perform important interactional tasks. As subsequent reference forms, pronouns allow speakers to index initial person reference formulations and listeners to track referred-to parties. Pronouns are systematically relevant for subsequent person reference, and can be seen as accountably missing when not used. Speakers usually do subsequent reference with either ""she"" or ""he,"" and there is no unmarked, ungendered option for subsequent reference to an individual in English. This paper examines the use and suppression of pronouns in references to persons with non-binary genders, specifically in this case, drag queens (Rupp and Taylor 2003).

For example, in the following, Greg tells about the first time he saw his boyfriend Gary, who is a professional drag queen. Greg uses masculine pronouns several times, yet he sometimes avoids pronouns and other gendered formulations.

G: he was there he was there I s- I was with a friend and I saw this- from about three quarters from behind I saw somebody >and it was he didnt have a wig on your hair was short actually but you had makeup on< I never really saw the face but (long pause) I- will never forget that- one-point-five seconds of seeing this person from twenty feet away in a crowd didnt see him again never forgot that moment I dont know why it was just one of those things that I saw this person and (pause) and then about a year later

When Greg frames his story or relates facts about this encounter, he uses masculine pronouns, as in ""he was there"" (a). On the other hand, when he describes what he saw and felt at the time, he sidesteps gender categorization. Being a competent member of this culture requires the ability to perceive binary gender (West and Fenstermaker 1995). Formulations such as ""I never really saw the face"" (b) provide an account for Gregs inability to see Garys gender while avoiding naming it, in this case by placing ""the"" where a pronoun ought to be.

Although pronouns do ""simple"" subsequent reference (Schegloff 1996), gender is an ""inference-rich"" (Sacks 1995: 40) category, so by using pronouns Greg would also be making claims about his desire: that he was attracted to Gary as a man or as a woman. Instead, he uses elaborate strategies to avoid doing gender categorization and to account for ""seeing this person"" without ""seeing"" her or his gender."

The results indicated that although cosmeceutical product ads/news did not exert a great influence on college womens perceptions of self body-esteem, respondents with different levels of self body-esteem showed significant differences in terms of beauty care decision-making. Information utility of cosmeceutical product ads/news was also examined in this study, and the findings suggested that all respondents had negative perceptions about the utility of the information conveyed by the ads/news. However, their perceptions of information utility were positively associated with their likelihood to take certain types of cosmeceutical products."

Applying the Investment Model to Family Communication Research,Communicating in Interpersonal Relationships,,,,Paper,Is Familial Commitment a Choice or an Obligation? Applying the Investment Model to Family Communication Research,Communicating in Interpersonal Relationships,"The decision to stay in or leave a current relationship is a phenomenon furiously investigated by close relationship researchers. Rusbult, Drigotas, and Verette (1994) suggest that individuals who are happy will remain in their relationship; however, understanding the variables associated with satisfaction may clue us into how and why individuals stay in that relationship when their satisfaction has been challenged. The investment model of developing relationships was offered as a way to predict such commitment and satisfaction in ongoing relationships (Rusbult, 1980a). But is commitment always a choice? With its roots in attraction literature (Rusbult, 1991), the investment model appears to be a far stretch when applying the bases of commitment to familial relationships. The involuntary nature of family ties (Matthews & Rosner, 1988) implies that individuals are expected to always be part of the family they were born into, thus, participating in permanent commitment not necessarily experienced in romantic relationships, friendships, or working relationships. The aim of the paper is to explicate commitment as described by Rusbults (1980a) investment model and to integrate Johnsons (1991a) commitment framework to further illustrate the importance of commitment in family and to demonstrate through empirical evidence, the insight this integrated model may provide family communication researchers."

Blogging and the Extreme Right,Limits to Creating Critical Content Online,"Progressive political movements and activists are not the only ones appropriating weblogging as a way to construct independent public spaces and voice counter-hegemonic discourses. By looking at the other extreme of (post-)fascist movements, it will be shown that the Internet also gives rise to anti-public spaces, voicing hatred and essentialist discourses, at times even negating the holocaust or justifying racist murders on foreigners. In this paper, the use of the Internet by North-Belgian (post-)fascist movements and activists will be analysed in depth. A first case study will look at an extreme right blog that has been stirring up considerable controversy in North-Belgium. The second case will assess the reactions on neo-fascist blogs and forums (based in the US) of a racist murder in Antwerp. Both cases challenge the limits of freedom of speech and of radical pluralism and bring us to question whether being a racist is a democratic right, whether freedom of speech includes opinions and views that challenging basic democratic values."

MiniMAM: Developing a Short Version of the Motivation Activation Measure,Information Systems Interactive High-Density: Emotion and Motivation Underlying Information Processing,"This paper is a part of a line of research designed to develop a measures of individual differences in motivational activation. Previous research produced the Motivational Activation Measure, or MAM (Lang, Shin, Lee, 2005) based on dimensional emotion theories that conceptualize emotion as a function of activation in the motivational systems. This study aims to validate short version of Motivation Activation Measure (MAM) developed by Lang and her colleagues. To do so, we examined whether the positivity offset (PO) and negativity bias (NB) assessed by the short version of MAM, called MiniMAM, would be comparable with those assessed by MAM, and whether PO and NB measures would accurately predict differences in sensation seeking scales and behavioral indicators of motivational activation including substance use and spent time viewing. Overall, the results of this study indicate that MiniMAM has potential to be a reliable and valid measure of positivity offset and negativity bias as much as MAM. It is hoped that future research in this area will continue to refine the measures of positivity offset and negativity bias as a useful tool to help us to design effective media messages."

In so doing, we test the proposition that risk judgments influenced by routine episodic coverage of events such as crime or accidents may serve as a framing mechanism explaining news media effects on public policy support in the domain of health policy. Analyses indicated that the (positive) influence of attention to news about crime and accidents on support for laws increasing server liability and limiting marketing of alcohol products was mediated by concern about risks of alcohol-related injuries and by perceptions of the severity of the consequences of alcohol-related injuries and their prevalence. Tests of model fit suggest that concern causally precedes the more cognitive risk judgments in the mediation model."

Instead of using generalized policy options to which respondents will have no prior attachment, and focusing on the issue of poverty, we examine whether framing poverty in terms of lives lost versus life saved affects responsiveness towards the issue. We measure subjects self assessment of future involvement as well as policy support after exposing them to a PSA on poverty framed in terms of either gains or losses. Participants negative affect under both frames is also analyzed."

It also compares media agendas across countries to consider whether international intermedia influence exists. Findings suggest a general pattern of the agenda-setting function of mass media in the countries examined. The study also found evidence of international intermedia influence and thus presents a new way to look at the intermedia agenda-setting relationship  moving this research from comparisons within a local area to cross-national intermedia comparisons.

This has been especially emphasized for women in the third world and Africa in particular. Indeed one could argue, as with all communication technology, that the potentials are infinite and provide an important bridge between various, increasingly transitional, communitiestransitioning individuals from local existences, into more global communities (Castells,1996). Some have noted (Marcelle, 1999; Rathgeber and Adera, 2000) that ICTs could turn African women into decision makers and actors in the information society. It has been argued that, for the first time, Africans living in remote areas could bring their perspectives, viewpoints and experience to the global marketplace of ideas and knowledge (Rathgeber, 2000). Others have argued that ICTs makes it possible for women to engage in cultural creation in the global environment and at the same time stay entrenched in their local cultures (Harcourt, 1999). But, in spite of all its emancipatory possibilities, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the ICT discourse in Africa has largely constructed African women as problemsas the otherpassive recipients and consumers of western communications products rather than active agents in the production and dissemination of ICTs. Drawing on this contradiction between the global discourse of emancipation, and the localized neo-colonial discourse of other that is present in organizations such as the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and positioning it within the work of postcolonial feminists such as Chandra Mohanty and Aihwa Ong, this paper makes connections between language, knowledge and power to articulate how women in rural Africa continue to be objects, rather than subjects, in the discourses surrounding information communication technologies."

Visual reporting about the 2006 war in Lebanon,News Framing and International Conflicts: Contexts and Impacts,"Modern military conflicts have become TV events, leading even to manipulation of visual content. Parties or countries in conflict use news control, e.g. by the employment of embedded journalists, and even the staging of pseudo-events to enlist international media to their cause. Although the nature of footage from the battlefield has been characterized by a narrow range of predictable, recurrent motifs (Griffin 2004), perception of the conflict by the international publics depends on how the conflict is visualized. This paper examines the visual reporting from the 2006 war in Lebanon, analyzing the representation of victims and combatants on the screen. Based on the available footage, reports in German, English and Arabic satellite TV news painted a rather one-sided picture of the conflict, focusing on Lebanese victims and Israeli aggressors. Hizbullah fighters, that resisted Israeli forces for more than two weeks and managed to maintain a rocket bombardment of Israel, were notably absent from TV footage. Moreover, most reports led by addressing Lebanese victims, even when mentioning Israeli victims later. Among the possible reasons for the observed structure of visual reporting, this paper addresses hypotheses of journalistic bias and political framing as well as the impact of the decisions of international TV news agencies about the allocation of their resources."

We focus on the organizing of individual and collective consciousness in local consumption and consumer relationships. More specifically, raising consciousness about consumer/social issues is a praxis in as much as it is rhetorically informed and strategically enables consumers to practice judgment in order to consume conscientiously. We believe that effective conscientious consumption emerges from collectivities of consumers that identify and are identifiable through networks of solidarity with other consumers and laborers.

Our panel contribution will introduce Ithaca HOURS, a Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) in Ithaca, New York, that has garnered international attention and has spawned other local currency programs. Our discussion addresses the relationship between HOURS members as individuals, and HOURS as a collective endeavor to develop a successful alternative to dominant economic structures"

During this time in the context of faculty senate meetings several faculty members posed questions and suggested proposals in anticipation of the crisis. The budget crisis still occurred, and afterwards, the decision of the university administration in handling the crisis were met with criticism from faculty (see Castor & Cooren, 2006). The purpose of this paper is to analyze questions and responses in faculty senate discussions related to the impending university budget crisis in order to understand how the questions and responses constructed the crisis situation and related social action.

Problem setting is a process in which, interactively, we name the things to which we will attend and frame the context in which we will attend to them (Schön, 1983, p. 40). Formulating problems is a social construction process. It is important to examine this process because how problems are formulated has implications for future action. However past research related to organizational crises and problems has tended to focus on managing the public relations aspects of a crisis or retrospective accounts of problems. Therefore, a significant research area for more development is to examine how, in the midst of a problem, organizational members make sense of their situation. Questions and responses are the focal discursive units for understanding problem construction given that questions and responses may shape future action though how they frame current circumstances.

The analysis of this paper will be developed by first providing an overview of literatures based on organizational problem formulation and questioning. Second, background information will be provided on the context of this study. The data for this project include discussions form two faculty senate meetings, plus background documents such as minutes and agendas. Third meeting discourse will be analyzed by applying Buttnys (1993) Conversation Analytic Constructionist approach. The analysis of data will focus on the forms of questions and responses and their implications for constructing organizational crisis and social action.

Current research paradigms focus on exposure to sexual content as a precursor to sexual behavior. That is, our theoretical models presume that exposure precedes behavior. It is plausible, however, that there is a reciprocal relationship between sexual content exposure and sexual behavior. Does exposure to sex in the media cause adolescents to become more sexually active, or do adolescents interested in sex expose themselves to sex in the media? Longitudinal data analysis is not sufficient to address this question since the processes might be simultaneous in nature. Thus results from non-recursive regression analyses (3 stage least squares analysis) on survey data collected from a convenience sample of adolescents ages 14-16 (n=457) indicate that the relationship between sexual content exposure and sexual behavior is simultaneous."

An Arab viewer explains, I watch CNN  nobody gets killed. I watch Al-Jazeera  its like tragedy. Few studies have explored support for the use of graphic visuals. The debate about where to draw the line and whether to show or not to show graphic imagery suggests that more attention needs to be focused on the issue. The 9/11 terrorists attack and the recent wars in Afghanistan, Lebanon and Iraq, have revived research on the use of graphic visuals in reporting military conflicts. The author will explain findings showing support for graphic visuals among Arab viewers of Al-Jazeera. Different approaches to mediating graphic scenes from the front lines and whether a universal code of ethics can be created will also be discussed."

The primary aim of this paper is to analyze the complex and diverse ways in which Japanese youths engage with media and ICT, understanding and bringing together audience activities under the concept of audience engagement. Further, the analysis of the Japanese audience can serve as a modest step towards the de-Westernization of media studies. In the process, some Japanese emic concepts are employed, adapting them in ways that reject as myth the homogeneity of the Japanese, in order to highlight culturally specific ways of constructing self and other. Methodologically, the qualitative approach adopted is intended to complement the quantitative emphasis to audience research within Japanese academia. Specifically, the present study is conducted as an ethnography of audiences, among the so-called modern Japanese families living in the media-rich Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Drawing from my ethnographic research on audience engagement in Japan, the paper addresses the cultural specificities and commonalities between Japanese and Western childhood media, while offering insights from a non-Western perspective, a move which I hope will contribute towards a de-Westernizing of media studies."

Internet Discussion Boards and Their Role in the Moral Panic of Muslim Migrant Youth in the Netherlands,Race and Ethnicity in Risk Situations,"The role of the Muslim migrant in the Netherlands has come under fire the last few years, especially after the murders of politician Pim Fortuyn and film director Theo Van Gogh, resembling what Hall et al. has called a moral panic. The classic moral panic theory highlights the role of the mainstream media and the impossibility of the deviant minority to form a counter consensus. Is this still true in our current information age, with a proliferation of micro-media such as blogs, discussion boards etc.? This paper attempts to answer this question by looking at how the main newspapers in the Netherlands report and frame the use of discussion boards by the Muslim migrant youth. Are these discussion boards seen as a Jihad recruiting ground, or a place for the Muslim youth to to find love and happiness?"

It presents the 3 main fields of observing changes in the world of journalism: modification of journalistic programs, alteration of journalistic organizations and changes of journalistic roles. The paper combines theoretical ideas with empirical research about journalism and presents data from an elaborated 3-year research project in Germany that examines the change of journalism in traditional news media (print, broadcast, online). The challenges of social change are discussed  both for journalism theory and empirical research in the field of journalism. The research methods are, amongst others: long-term (10 years) content-analysis of media content from newspapers, print-, TV-, and radio-magazines and online media; in-depth-interviews with some 50 journalist from different media; observations in the newsrooms of 15 media organizations. A prestudy of a professional journal for journalists shows several changes in different sectors of journalism.

Popular culture has long told tales of young, idealistic male journalists confronting the harsh cynicism of newsrooms overseen by tyrannical male editors. The 2006 movie The Devil Wears Prada puts a distinctively feminine twist on that story while offering a complex and contradictory depiction of journalism and gender.

The film tells of recent journalism school graduate Andy Sachs. After finding no other suitable news job in New York, she becomes an assistant to Miranda Priestly, editor of the fashion magazine Runway. Andy learns to cope with the impossible demands Priestly makes of her and with cruel comments about her weight and attire. She becomes a fashion maven and embraces the glitzy world she had initially scorned, much to her boyfriends consternation. Eventually, Andy comes to see the error of her ways. She abandons the magazine, returns to her boyfriend, and assumes a position with a respectable newspaper.

In many ways, the movie reproduces familiar themes in movies about journalism. The idealistic young journalist emerges wiser and less naïve following the confrontation with the cynical world of the big-city press; good journalism is embraced whereas bad journalism is rejected. In other ways, the movie presents a comparatively progressive portrait of the female journalist, ultimately granting her both a happy personal relationship and a satisfying job. However, the movie also subverts its message by making its fashion editor an icon of power and independence and raising the question of whether the young journalists decision to reject that world may have been a mistake."
2007-0824,"Journalism and Human Rights: Which Humans, Whose Rights?",Journalism and Human Rights,,,,Paper,"Journalism and Human Rights: Which Humans, Whose Rights?",Journalism and Human Rights,"The call to use journalism in the service of human rights constitutes a seemingly appropriate utilization of journalists access to the not-readily-accessed events of mass destruction, human violence, and atrocity that populate the public sphere. Underlying such service is the notion that journalists are able to address the violations of human rights in ways that cut across norms of selection and presentation. This paper uses news images to show some of the ways in which journalists address to human rights violations is always patterned, inevitably incomplete and often problematic. In so doing, it queries whether we have become complacent in our demands of journalism when it comes to the most fundamental violations against individuals in the 21st century."
2007-0825,Journalism Culture: A Two-Levels Proposal,Political Culture and Journalism Culture: Theoretical Approaches,,,,Paper,Journalism Culture: A Two-Levels Proposal,Political Culture and Journalism Culture: Theoretical Approaches,"After discussing the most important views on the concept of journalism culture this paper proposes another possible interpretation that is organized on two different levels. The first, and most basic level, refers to the very professional culture and its whole of procedures and routines. The second one intends to place professional journalism within the more general political and cultural framework of the society within which it develops. In particular the author stresses the existing connections between the idea of political culture and that of journalism culture. He tries to link journalism culture to social role and its perception by different social actors, including journalists, and to rational legal authority. He shows how these two concepts are able to determine and affect journalism culture that is indeed placed within some of the most important cultural features of the surrounding society."

This paper addresses one of the ways in which journalism changed as a result of the introduction of television technology: the focus on the appearance of TV journalists. This is an element of the journalists job that is unsettled within the American journalistic community and with which the community continues to grapple. The journalists appearance became central to the journalists job through the visual imagery of television, marking a departure from the attributes commonly associated with journalists more generally. Of all those practicing journalism in the television era, the struggle between the time-honored principles of print and radio journalism and these new elements introduced by television is experienced to the greatest degree by the TV news anchors themselves. The television news anchor embodies the effect of television technology on journalism through traits associated with his or her visual presence, qualities related to personalization, and other aspects of a particular kind of relay of news to audiences. Anchors are also important to consider, for when it comes to anchors, the journalistic community is schizophrenic; externally, it uses anchors for community promotion and reaps the positive benefits of power, adulation, and affirmation of authority that anchors afford. But internally, the community feels that anchors, and the appearance of anchors in particular, undermine many key journalistic values. This paper uses the anchor as a lens through which to examine the journalistic communitys struggle brought on by the wedding of journalism and television technology, as manifested in discussion about anchors appearances."
2007-0827,Journalisms in Europe: Comparing Reporting Styles and Levels of Europeanization in Eastern and Western Europe,European News and European Politics: Universalism Versus Difference,,,,Paper,Journalisms in Europe: Comparing Reporting Styles and Levels of Europeanization in Eastern and Western Europe,European News and European Politics: Universalism Versus Difference,"This paper presents a systematic comparison of online newspaper coverage comprising both Eastern and Western European countries (Austria, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom). Countries were sampled according to the classification developed by Hallin and Mancini (liberal, democratic-corporatist, polarized-pluralist countries) as well as according to membership status in the European Union (6 old members, 2 members that have joined in 2004, and 2 members joining in 2007). Analysis focuses on three dimensions: similarity in reporting styles (i.e. factualness of new reports), vertical Europeanization of news (focus on EU matters and domestication of EU issues) as well as horizontal Europeanization (intensity and patterns of mutual observation between countries). Correlational, regression, and cluster analyses are employed in studying the data. Results show that there are no systematic country differences in reporting styles, thus lending support to the homogenization thesis. Levels of both vertical and horizontal Europeanization in news can be explained by EU membership status, with different patterns emerging for the 2 dimensions of Europeanization. In mutual observation between EU member countries, Western European countries get the bulk of attention but this can be explained by their bigger size, not by a particular neglect of the East or by the duration of EU membership. In conclusion, more theory-driven explanatory research on country differences in news reporting is advocated."

Using Pierre Bourdieu's sociological theories of field analysis, it proposes a model of American media criticism that attaches judgments of journalistic professionalism to social relations, power dynamics, and rhetorical strategies. The aim of this relational model is to offer directions for future research on the intersections of journalistic codes of ethics with the external forces that condition their realization."

On a methodological level, Bourdieus field theory shows potential in addressing one of the key questions in ethnographic research: The concept of 'context'. The question is not least practical in nature. When it comes to newsroom ethnography, one of the traditional inference problems is the 'invisibility' of the structures guiding journalistic practice, for instance the political-economy of everyday news work. Working with the analytical concepts journalistic field, news habitus and newsroom capital, reflexive sociology offers a research strategy for simultaneously studying journalistic practices and the structures that enable and constrain them. This presentation will define the key concepts for using reflexive sociology as framework for ethnographic media production studies, using illustrative empirical material from a Danish television news ethnography."
2007-0830,"Journalistic Professionalism, Knowledge, and Cultural Authority: Towards a Theoretical Framework",Building Core Theories About the Culture of Journalism in an Age of Relentless Change,,,,Paper,"Journalistic Professionalism, Knowledge, and Cultural Authority: Towards a Theoretical Framework",Building Core Theories About the Culture of Journalism in an Age of Relentless Change,"As tides of structural and organizational change wash across the landscape of contemporary journalism, media theorists have only begun to grapple with dramatic changes in media practice. Are we witnessing, through the impact of the Internet and digital technologies, ""journalism's transformation from a 20th century mass-media structure to something profoundly more grassroots and democratic?"" Or, as Herbert Gans has recently argued, has little actually changed when it comes to ""deciding what's news?"" Although some early academic work has fruitfully analyzed the impact of the Internet and its various journalistic stepchildren on traditional forms of news gathering and reporting, little of this work has systematically engaged with higher-level social theory in the broader sense. In the paper that follows I attempt to outline an integrative theoretical structure within which to analyze changes that may or (may not) be taking place in the idea and practice of 21st century journalism, drawing on classic work within the sociology of the professions as well as more poststructuralist understandings of the role played by expert knowledge in the grounding of professional status. Researchers exploring the Internet's impact on journalism, I argue, would be well served by a theoretical framework that analyzes journalism as an object and field of struggle in which a variety of social and occupational groups attempt to define the abstract knowledge needed (or not needed) by journalists, and to establish jursisdiction, via work, over that knowledge."
2007-0831,Journalistic Understanding of Road Safety: From Routine Issue to Prestigious Breaking News.,The Symbolic Power of Breaking News: 'Field Theory' Case Studies on French and U.S. Journalism,,,,Paper,Journalistic Understanding of Road Safety: From Routine Issue to Prestigious Breaking News.,The Symbolic Power of Breaking News: 'Field Theory' Case Studies on French and U.S. Journalism,"Road safety news used to be considered as non interesting routine information by French television journalists. However, after the presidential policy priority given to the problem in 2002 there was an explosion of reports about road risks in the television news. Also, the issue of road safety was increasingly formatted as breaking news thus emphasizing the newsworthiness and the journalistic value of that kind of breaking news.
Adjusted to journalistic expectations, this new politically safe frame, which only claims individual responsibility, actualizes the specific capital of new journalists which rise in the editorial hierarchy thanks to road safety breaking news.
The political priory on road safety has indirect influence on the journalistic work division: Before it was mainly automobile journalists who covered road safety but after 2002 there are many examples of news journalist being taken away from prestigious columns in order to cover the issue. These journalists are not specialised and therefore potentially more vulnerable to official sources and dominant frames spread by public institutions or claimsmakers.
The inflation of breaking news on road safety has also produced a new journalistic understanding of this State issue, which contributes to cancelling the political dimension of road mortality by reducing the causal imputation to driver behaviour only, and not to broader social structural causes."
2007-0832,"Journalists, War Crimes, and International Justice",Journalism and Human Rights,,,,Paper,"Journalists, War Crimes, and International Justice",Journalism and Human Rights,"This paper sets out to examine issues surrounding the decisions by journalists whether to appear as witnesses in international war crimes trials, tribunals and truth commissions. The examination of the ethical and moral issues surrounding the reporting of war crimes signals what has become one of the outstanding problems facing journalism in the contemporary era. As the nature of war has changed, so has the nature of the journalism mandated to cover it, and the selection of war crimes trials, tribunals and truth commissions are key places in which to analyze these changes. Journalists and news organisations are divided over the merits of testifying at international war crimes tribunals. To some degree the debate about appearing before war crimes courts has split along European and US lines. A number of European journalists and documentary film makers willingly testified before the war crimes tribunal in The Hague whilst US journalists tend to see the subpoena power of the tribunals as a threat to first Amendment freedoms. Based on interviews conducted with journalists, editors, lawyers, and humanitarian aid workers the paper explores questions of journalistic objectivity and impartiality; the verification of journalists stories; the safety repercussions for journalists participating in international trials; and the implications for the erosion of confidentiality of journalists sources."

It compares the United States with Australia, Canada, and England, for the courts in these countries have ruled on whether to assert jurisdiction over foreigners who have published defamatory statements via the Internet. Since the early 1990s, American courts have considered whether they should enforce foreign libel judgments under the principles of comity without violating the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."

Framing the Blogs: Emergence of the Blogosphere in Mainstream U.S. Newspaper Coverage (1999-2005) TOP STUDENT PAPER Nr. 1,Online News and Civic Journalism,"Blogs are suggested to be a new form of grassroots journalism, which may pose a competition to traditional journalism arenas of power, as news and politics. Most Americans, nonetheless, learn about new technologies, such as blogs, from traditional media. Ironically, it is up to the press to introduce and portray the blogs phenomenon to most of the public. This study aims to explore how major US newspapers framed blogs and blogging from 1999 to 2005. Findings show that articles framed blogs typically as a positive phenomenon but, at the same time excluded them from the public arena, where traditional journalistic societal role resides. Blogging was also rarely associated with the journalistic work. By segregating blogs to the private and personal sphere, traditional media restrict public discussion on the benefits of blogs to society, as an alternative, or even completing, source for information and opinions."
2007-0835,Juxtaposing Handloom Weaving and Modernity: Making the Case for Building Theory Situated in Praxis,Refining Communication Theory,,,,Paper,Juxtaposing Handloom Weaving and Modernity: Making the Case for Building Theory Situated in Praxis,Refining Communication Theory,"This paper investigates the interaction between processes of building development theory and development practice. Arguing that theory-building must of necessity be ground up  starting with practice  not top down, starting with the outside gaze of a so-called detached Academician or Policy Maker. The paper poses questions that point to critiques of mainstream development narratives and notions of innovation through diffusion of new technologies. The authors suggest that processes have embedded assumptions which lead to inequalities in access to global and local markets and when processes are imposed from the outside with no in-depth understanding of the context, the development project is implicitly set up for failure. Parameters for assessment and evaluation of outcome should also be determined through a close understanding of the context  and this often comes through involvement with the context and not through being detached and outside. Thus we suggest that development practice should engage theory-building spaces and vice versa, in order to shape agenda setting, rather than remaining as an implementing arm for top-down development agendas. The assumption that an outside gaze is objective is based in an implicitly colonial discourse. As critical feminist scholars and activists have pointed many times over, studying through doing  i.e. being involved in the practice while building theory  produces better methodologies for action and development."

This study extends family secrets research by investigating variables related to family members desires to keep HIV-status secrets. 2 studies, 2 years apart, included adult-respondents (N = 1358) in northern Namibia where HIV is prevalent. The sense of an environment inappropriate for disclosure and a lack of efficacy to oppose it correlated with an increase in a persons desire to keep their family members HIV+ status as secret. These findings show that ideas on family secrets generalize to desires to keep a specific health secret within a region of southern Africa."

Women's Identities,,,,Work in Progress,Keeping Up and Shutting Out: Media Use Among Female Inmates,Solitude or Solidarity? Women's Identities,"This paper is a work in progress, exploring the use of media among female jail and prison in-mates. Correctional facilities constitute unique environments of media use that warrant a reassessment of conventional approaches to media audiences, including the exploration of gender. First, two areas of research will be introduced that provide a framework for this study: an overview of the issues concerning women and incarceration, as well as the scant literature on media use in prisons. This paper then presents initial findings of surveys and personal interviews about media use conducted with female inmates at two correctional facilities in the southwestern United States. The study concludes that those media that provide the most privacy and potential to take the inmate symbolically out of the environment (such as books, magazines, and the radio) are most popular among the female inmate population. Further, particular content, such as Lifetime television is embraced by many incarcerated women as a way to cope with personal issues, while others reject it for bringing them too close to those issues."

The study replicated previous results showing that participants were more aroused and remembered more risky compared to nonrisky pictures with children and adolescents. Of more interest, however, were the significant differences they found in responses as a function of negativity bias and positivity offset. Individuals high in positivity offset tended to have stronger appetitive reactions to risky products compared to those low in positivity offset and those high in negativity bias tended to have more aversive reactions to risky products compared to those low in negativity bias. Overall, the results suggest that emotional and cognitive responses to risk are modified both by age and by individual differences in motivational activation. The overall patterns of difference between risky and nonrisky pictures seen in previous studies were replicated here."
2007-0839,Killed in Action: Limitations of Postmortem Relational Privacy Jurisprudence,The Right to Know and the Right Not to Be Known,,,,Paper,Killed in Action: Limitations of Postmortem Relational Privacy Jurisprudence,The Right to Know and the Right Not to Be Known,"In 2005, the Bush Administration repealed a 15-year-old policy that limited public access to military homecoming ceremonies for service members killed in combat operations overseas. Public access to government-generated photographs of the ceremonies was also restricted. The policy was based on relational privacy jurisprudence  the idea that families of the deceased have a right to privacy and that public access to such ceremonies was an unwarranted invasion of that right.
Relational privacy is a developing area of the law with its common law roots in cases as recent as the 1980s. Repealing this policy was a clear limitation to the application of the post-mortem relational privacy argument and has implications for media law and policy and government application of FOIA exemptions for privacy."

It incorporates and revises a framework set forth by Finn et al (2000) as a mode for understanding intended website activity. Major studios use websites as one element in an overall media saturation effort, viewing websites primarily as a vehicle to maximize revenues, as is the case with ""King Kong"" and ""The Guardian."" Fan network websites, such as that of ""Star Wars"" or ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" are variations on this theme, whereby major studios encourage fan involvement with the goal of maximizing revenues. Independent filmmakers, in contrast, use websites to cultivate relationships with potential audiences, soliciting support in building word of mouth for their films. This strategy has even been extended to include other networking websites like MySpace, as indicated by the promotional campaigns of films like ""LOL"" and ""The Last Romantic."""
2007-0842,"Knowledgeable Citizens, Election Outcomes, and Good Government",Knowledge & Information Processing,,,,Paper,"Knowledgeable Citizens, Election Outcomes, and Good Government",Knowledge & Information Processing,"A common sense proposition holds that knowledgeable citizens recognize and express their interests better in their voting behavior. An important implication is that a better informed citizenry should be conducive to producing better governments. This paper proposes that the most realistic way of conceptualizing what a knowledgeable citizenry may mean in the context of this proposition is to concentrate on the extent to which people vote as if they were fully informed. This, for all practical purposes, depends on how widely political communications make accessible such useful information shortcuts that allow even citizens with low knowledge to emulate the voting behavior of a person with identical underlying preferences but much higher information level. Sophisticated methods to estimate the gap between fully informed and observed election outcomes have become available in the last decade. This paper applies Bartels (1996) simulation procedure to postelection survey data from 61 elections. The estimated size of these information effects are then related to World Bank time-series data on the quality of governance in each country. By and large, the size of information effects on election outcomes does have the theoretically expected negative and substantially large effect on the quality of governance, but only after multiple elections, and probably not on all aspects of good governance. Overall, the results suggest that the capacity of political communications to provide useful cues to voters may be a key determinant of the quality of governance in democracies."

This study focuses on how interdependent information sharing within a teams knowledge network and perceptions of knowledge interdependence impact members satisfaction with their teams overall performance. It is argued that perceived interdependence and information retrieval are important variables impacting members overall performance satisfaction. Hypotheses are tested on data from 10 intact, knowledge-based, professional work teams. Contrary to theoretical expectation, results show members who retrieve information from more teammates are more satisfied with their teams performance. Further, perceptions of knowledge interdependence do not show a direct relationship with performance satisfaction; they are positively related to topic-specific information retrieval."

Labeling is a process of naming that homogenizes inputs to organizational routines and provides a mechanism for monitoring their likelihood of success in a stochastic environment. In addition to describing the manner in which labels function, an evolutionary argument is developed explaining their emergence and potential community ecology dynamics of label populations."

Reconstructing Media Sport Coverage,Appearance and Personae: Reporters and the People They Report On,"Media coverage plays a significant role in shaping and reinforcing cultural values and images. Sport coverage has been maintaining gender differentiations by not only reporting about male athletes more often than about female athletes, but also by one-sidedly putting emphasis on attributes like athleticism and physicality when depicting sportsmen. The authors' research examines these patterns by analyzing German newspapers' coverage of sportsmen and -women competing in Biathlon or Cross-country skiing during the 2004/05 season. The results suggest that there is no inherent media bias towards one gender over the other. On the contrary, both genders are covered in a very similar way  both formal and content wise. These findings fortify the assumption that the level of professionalization of a sport affects media attention to a stronger degree than the factor of the athletes' gender."

Through a discussion of landscape theory and its implications within a larger postmodern paradigm, it will examine how imagery and narrative construct visions of politics in the United States that deviate from their (often ostensibly progressive) surface-level messages. As each trilogy is a landmark in popular and film culture, and as they attained considerable symbolic capital in both subculture and dominant culture, they are ideal entry points for a discussion of negotiated popular ideology. Moreover, as the Terminator trilogy spans twenty years from its first to its third film, and changes considerably in its politics, it provides a useful counterpoint to the massive The Matrix and Lord of the Rings productions. By discussing all three through their visual rhetoric, it is possible to navigate the often perplexing worlds of United States ideology, and the increasingly blurred lines between progressive and reactionary agendas."

Telephone interviews (N=253) averaged 41 minutes. Respondents completed the Bi-dimensional Acculturation Scale, the CES depression scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and self-reported physical health. Scores on the acculturation measure categorized respondents as bicultural (bilingual), assimilated (predominantly English speaking), or separated (predominantly Spanish speaking). A series of hierarchical general linear models with education and income as covariates were performed. Bonferroni corrected comparisons of estimated group means showed the predominantly English speaking group reported less well being than the bilingual group or the predominantly Spanish speaking group. The bilingual group reported better health than the other groups. Possible reasons for the high performance of the bicultural group are discussed.

Given that the DELTA is intended for educators working in a huge number of different countries, who work with learners from a great diversity of cultural and educational backgrounds, it might be expected that cultural factors affecting learning should be a main focus. An examination of the syllabus, however, indicates that this is not the case. This study explored the views and experiences of trainees on DELTA courses in the USA and in Vietnam. Candidates were asked to evaluate the perceived cultural appropriateness of aspects of teaching methodology to their current, former and future teaching situations. The study showed that this was a new area of consideration for most candidates. Possible implications for language teacher training are highlighted and considered."

In particular, it critically examines the San Jose Mercury News's diversity policies from the perspective the Latina/o community. It shows that, despite the Mercury News's efforts to get closer and be more sensitive to this community, many Latinas/os think the newspaper is a strong force against their interests. In order to explain this apparent contradiction, this paper argues that the Mercury News has adopted--and adapted--diversity at a superficial level. It has made it serve the needs of the professional business model of journalistic production. These needs, however, are significantly different from the needs of Latinas/os and other disempowered social groups."

Hybridity is explored as ongoing cultural change in which audience identity changes along with television production and flow, a change which largely takes place in the long run. Multilayered identities are explored both theoretically and as grounded theory reflecting the way in which audiences reflect upon their own experience and choices as viewers. Theoretically, multilayered identities are explored in terms of global cultural geography, social class, race, and gender. In-depth interviews with Latino viewers in Texas are explored to examine a similar set of multilayered identities which arise as grounded theory from the interviews themselves."

This paper examines the ways in which the texts and implementation practices of U.S. law deal with official memory (the record of decisions, events, processes, and people claimed by the state), public memory (information about state decisions, events, processes, and people available to citizens), and individual memory (personal memory of decisions, events, processes, and people that is acceptable as legal evidence when disagreements about events reach court). Official memory in the U.S. is today more vulnerable to political intervention than at any time since the National Archive was established in the 1930s. Public memory is undergoing erasure. And the quality of individual memory is being questioned on every front. While these trends have developed in response to a wide range of types of issues, events, and concerns, all have political gravitas given current political circumstances. Records unavailable for official memory purposes now, however, may become available later. It is to this goal that further policy analysis and recommendations should be addressed."

Even communication strategies that are intended to increase the cultural sensitivity of health messages, such as the use of metaphorical language, may lead to unintended outcomes if the messages are not grounded in local culture. The purpose of this study was to understand how a medically underserved audience of rural, low-income, older adult women perceive metaphorical language strategies for explaining random assignment to condition as it pertains to Phase III cancer clinical trials. This was accomplished through 11 in-depth interviews and 4 focus groups with members of the intended audience. The research findings included the perception that conventional metaphors are references to gambling, problems associated with using definitions for randomization, and an audience generated strategy for creating a culturally grounded explanations for randomization. Implications for health communication efforts among medically underserved populations are discussed."

On New Types of Political Communication in Changing Media Environments,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Ten years after the broad diffusion of the Internet, this paper examines the impact this diffusion has had on political communication of citizens by now. It can be expected in particular that sub-groups have developed in western societies  presumably among the younger population  that have strongly integrated the Internet even in their political communication. By means of cluster analysis the authors developed an empirical typology that identifies five groups of individuals with distinct political communication styles. It can be shown that one group appears on the scene  the Lazy Modernists  that relies heavily on means of online communication and is sharply separated from the other four, more traditionally communicating groups. As this group can be expected to gain more relevance in our societies in the forthcoming decades, several consequences for research and political practice are discussed."

Virtual teams offer advantages to employers, including reduced savings and larger applicant pools. However, with these benefits come new challenges. Leaders within virtual teams must confront technological issues, cultural miscommunication, and restructuring their communication to include both local and distanced staff. Additionally, strategically selecting team members, building effective relationships, fostering trust, facilitating communication, and achieving team goals are key for effective virtual teams."

However, research has not yet examined how characteristics of students as learners influence their responses to ART. The current study examined aptitude for learning, objective learning (i.e., class performance), subjective learning (i.e., self-perceived learning), and conceptualizations of the learning process as influences on students evaluation of ART. Students who had used ART over the course of a semester in one of three large lecture classes (N = 703) completed surveys assessing their learning characteristics, perceptions of ART influence on their attendance, motivation, and learning, liking for ART, and evaluations of the course and instructor. Controlling for course and instructor evaluations, aptitude and objective learning were weakly but negatively associated with evaluations of ART and subjective learning was positively associated with evaluations of ART. Further, different conceptualizations of learning have distinctive associations with ART evaluations. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for instructors use of ART."
2007-0857,Learning Political Information From the News: A Closer Look at the Role of Motivation,News Audiences,,,,Paper,Learning Political Information From the News: A Closer Look at the Role of Motivation,News Audiences,"Much has been written about the role of motivations in driving information-seeking behaviors. We investigate how motivations affect the process of learning from the news. Classical works suggest that motivations take many forms. The uses and gratifications perspective in mass communication theory explicitly recognizes that there are many different reasons for why people consume media, and scholars implicitly acknowledge that the specific reason or goal that directs media use behaviors strongly influence media effects. We propose a model that traces the influence of motivational factors on following news about general public affairs. Existing works on the role of motivation in influencing political knowledge by testing a multidimensional model of motivations are extended. We argue that motivations are organized into 2 tiers: the first tier is comprised of fundamental psychological needs, and the second tier is of media-related motivations to follow news. Next, we examine whether different types of motivation have independent effects on exposure and attention to news, as well as investigate their consequence on learning from the news. Tests conducted with nationally representative surveys revealed that motivations for following general public affairs in the news are conceptually and empirically distinct. Support was found for the 2-tiered model proposed: psychological needs drive motivations toward following general news. Evidence presented support the notion that various types of motivations have independent effects on exposure and attention to news. Finally, we found that motivations have significant indirect effects on knowledge about politics."

Using a probability sample, a telephone survey was conducted with 624 young adults between the ages of 14-28. Exploratory factor analysis identified 4 common mobile phone addiction symptoms: losing control and receiving complaints, anxiety and craving, withdrawal/escape, and productivity loss. Results show that the higher one scored on sensation seeking and leisure boredom, the higher the likelihood one was addicted to the mobile phone. Conversely, subjects who scored high on self-esteem -- who perceived themselves as being in control -- demonstrated less of a tendency to be addicted. Regression results also indicate that sensation seeking played the largest role in mobile phone addiction, while gender, self-esteem, and leisure boredom appeared to have a lesser but significant influence. In particular, those who were female and had low self-esteem were the most vulnerable."
2007-0859,"Leisure, Work, and Manliness: Masculinity-in-Decline and the Miller High Life Man",Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,"Leisure, Work, and Manliness: Masculinity-in-Decline and the Miller High Life Man",Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Recent decades have witnessed the growth of a masculinity-in-decline narrative which posits a world in which (white) masculinity is increasingly under siege by a variety of cultural forces. This narrative has been particularly prominent in depictions of the contemporary work world, once an overwhelmingly masculine province, where both the increasing presence of the female bodies of women workers and the increasing feminization of work practices (such as preferred approaches to managing employees) have been perceived in some quarters as posing a distinct threat to masculinitys centrality. Against this backdrop, in 1997 the Miller Brewing Company began to air a series of advertisements designed to resuscitate its High Life brand of beer  a brand that pioneered the overuse of masculinity as beer advertising tactic, but which had experienced a very real decline in sales since the late 1970s. The campaign, which lasted until 2005, invoked, in ironic fashion, the narrative of masculinity-in-decline through the mythical character of the High Life Man. This essay offers a critical examination of the manner in which these ads offered a solution to the crisis of masculinity by reasserting an excessive manliness in leisure to compensate for the threats to masculinity at work. In doing so, the ads both conformed and transformed the generic conventions of beer advertising that the brand helped establish in the first place, simultaneously reinscribing and critically satirizing hegemonic masculinity in the process."

French newspapers became the epicenter of this controversy, republishing the controversial Danish cartoons several months later and running a myriad of editorials and a special series on the controversy. But what appears as a simple journalistic issue really represents much more: the revival of centuries-long debates over the role of religion and multiculturalism in the context of French secular republicanism. This paper explores how Frances leading newspaper, Le Monde, re-presented French secular republican ideology and the right of free expression in the wake of the Mohammad cartoons controversy. Data come from a search of Le Mondes online archive. A qualitative textual analysis was carried out, guided by the theoretical lens. Articles were analyzed to detect recurring thematic patterns of ideological representation, deterritorialization, and journalistic paradigm maintenance. Four key themes emerged: 1) paradigmatic and ideological maintenance through re-presentation; 2) mapping out and differentiating Western and Arabo-Islamic free speech values; 3) repairing the European journalistic paradigm; and 4) spotlighting the border within the border by differentiating American and British journalism from other journalism in the West. An implication of this study is that the journalistic paradigm exists, among other things, to defend the status quo that allows the craft to exist and function: a paradigm that insulates it from threats posed by the dogmatic religion or ideology of the Other."

The process of Europeanization has a vertical and a horizontal dimension: an increased focus on the EU as well as more attention for other European countries. A content analysis of quality newspapers in five EU member states covering a period of 20 years reveals common trends across different countries but no convergence over time. Four different patterns of Europeanization can be identified. This paper pushes research in this area ahead by identifying and testing factors which explain these differences in newspaper coverage. In-depth case analysis as well as regression analysis show that the editorial mission of a newspaper and the size of a country have a significant effect on patterns of Europeanization  but not the number of Brussels correspondents and the degree of popular identification with Europe.

To sustain their involvement and foster local investment to keep everyone logged on and literate, we need to shape public policy to reflect changing technological and demographic needs across America. In a 21st century democracy, policymakers must recognize the value and importance of supporting universal service for all.

In the digital age, all people must have the opportunity to participate in their communities economic, educational, social, political and leisurely activities. The E-Rate program, by supporting connectivity through public libraries, has helped close access gaps by offering affordable advanced telecommunications services to underserved communities. This paper argues that with increased funding, policy changes, and service improvements, the library component of the universal service program can deliver on the promise of information equity for all Americans."

They argue that in industrialized societies at work as well as in everyones life course self responsibility, self management, and self-organisation are increasingly expected under the conditions of short term employment, decreasing wages, reduced social insurances and protection. Under these conditions people experience the heightened responsibilities and the moments of autonomy to which they have to respond as active subjects as a new con-straint or excessive demand. Referring to these developments Lifestyle-TV is interpreted as a model to enact into these new forms of subjectivitiations or technologies of the self to correspond to the new societal challenges.
Using theories of late Foucault and governmentality studies this paper examines the political implications of Lifestyle TV on the on hand; on the other I will confront these considerations with the results of interviews with Lifestyle-TV-viewers; this is the way the notion of resistance will be grasped theoretically and empirically."

With its unprecedented immersiveness and scope, the game invites users to appropriate their virtual environment by diverging from the principle storylines and actively exploring the fantasy-world. To identify typical patterns of appropriation, we asked a sample of more than 1.000 players to keep track of their game-experience in an online-diary, including both standardized and open questions. This methodology permitted to trace the appropriation of a currently released computer game from the first sessions on - on both qualitative and quantitative levels. Results reveal to what degree and in which dimensions the appropriation of a computer game may be an open process which bears different experiences depending on the individual players' ways of handling the game both within its play-world and in the context of the users' exterior everyday life and social relations."

We interviewed 196 participants in three Washington, DC, metro neighborhoods. Participants were African-American, Latino, African and other ethnic minorities, 52% female and 48% male. About half the participants said they get their news from television, with Fox and NBC preferred. About a fourth said they read a newspaper. Those listening to radio (18%) overwhelmingly preferred a minority-owned station. Participants leaned toward believing the news did not help them to understand crime, rising costs of living and other problems they faced each day. They criticized the overemphasis on negative news and what they believed to be racist coverage of crime, wishing instead to hear more about solutions toward problems and more in-depth explanation for problems. They prefer news sources with greater detail, as well as news reported from the perspectives of those who experienced the problems. Dispatching news makers to their neighborhoods, participants said, was key to improving local news. Half the participants said the news did not affect their level of community involvement, with the rest saying either yes, it did, or that they were uncertain."

During that era Israel's media map changed drastically with the introduction of a multitude of electronic commercial media outlets, such as Israel's first commercial television channels and 14 local commercial radio stations. The paper contributes to the existing body of collective memory research by focusing on the ways by which the radio, a relatively less-investigated medium, figures within the process of constructing collective recollections. Correspondingly, the paper also investigates the influence of the tensions between commercial vs. public broadcasting and national vs. local broadcasting on the shaping of social memory.
We operationalized our general research question via a categorization of the 16,652 popular songs broadcasted on MDHH by 16 public and commercial radio stations and an analysis of the spoken texts that contextualized the presentation of the songs. The findings lists the 15 popular Hebrew songs most frequently aired on MDHH by a large majority of stations and explores the sources of their ""authority"" as signifiers of this traumatic memory. Correspondingly, the paper probes the different repertoires of some local stations (airing non-Israeli songs) and the implications of such musical choices."
2007-0870,Local Suffering-Global Power,The Mediation of Suffering and the Cultivation of Community,,,,Paper,Local Suffering-Global Power,The Mediation of Suffering and the Cultivation of Community,"This paper is about the symbolic power of television to make western
spectators care about -or not- distant suffering. Whereas global media enable an unprecedented visibility of distant misfortune, there is controversy over the impact of this visibility on western spectators (Silverstone 2006). Some talk about compassion fatigue, claiming that the mediation of misfortune ultimately diminishes our interest and care for distant others (Tester 2001), whereas others optimistically claim that a democratization of responsibility is today more possible than ever (Thompson 1995).
Applying an Analytics of Mediation (Chouliaraki 2004; 2006) on
examples from national and trans-national television, I show that news broadcasts draw selectively on the symbolic resources of language and image in order to bring suffering on our screens and, in so doing, they create specific hierarchies of place and human life.
To redress this imbalance, I conclude, we need to critically
examine the discourses and narratives through which global information flows today manage to encourage emotional identification only with those sufferers who are like us while dehumanising the others."

It elaborates on public opinion about the ongoing issues of crime and violence in remote Australian Indigenous communities by analyzing both media portrayals and local talk. Research that examined local talk about Indigenous issues found that social groups engaged in surprisingly sophisticated ways with complex policies and debates. Talk was grounded in local social networks and structured around broad, competing and contested narratives. In their conversations, members of the public engaged with media representations of public issues, but they localized, negotiated and contested dominant frames. Participants illustrated reflexivity about elite framing and media representation of public issues, and of the role of talk itself in the construction of public opinion about those issues. The challenge for journalists who publicize Indigenous issues is to overcome news values of conflict that dominate the reporting of race, and to engage with the multiple narratives that exist in local talk. This study demonstrates that local talk is a powerful resource for understanding public opinion on Indigenous and other social issues in Australia."

The newspaper featured several stories on Iraqs weapons of mass destruction using anonymous sources. In turn, these stories helped set the U.S. news agenda in the months before the start of the Iraq War. In the wake of revelations of faulty intelligence regarding Iraqs weapons, the Times received criticism over its reporting. In particular, the overuse of anonymous sourcing by reporter Judith Miller was blamed for relaying misleading information to readers. News sourcing raises tensions between journalisms claims to being independent and, in practice, its entrenched reliance on official sources. This contrast is made more complicated by anonymous sourcing and the removal of attribution from public view. As a result, the controversial use of anonymous sources strikes at the core of the credibility of the news. The paper traces the criticisms of the New York Timess prewar coverage as well as the response to its editors note a year into the war. The newspaper apologized for its prewar coverage and blamed both misinformation from Iraqi exiles as well as a newsroom culture driven by scoops. The Times attempted to repair damage to its credibility through restating the importance of skepticism as a norm of journalism. In doing so, the newspaper attempts to align the problematic practice of anonymous sourcing with the normative role of journalism in a democracy."

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a systematic analysis of media framing studies in the worlds leading communication journals. We present a quantitative content analysis of 131 studies published in fifteen international journals. The main results indicate a vast array of different issue-specific frames and a very strong standing of qualitatively oriented research. However, there has been a slight quantitative shift in the recent years. Current problems of research in media framing include insufficient reliability reporting, the atheoretical mere description of media content, and subjectivity in frame analysis. The implications of these results for future framing research are discussed."

The influence of hurtful interactions over time has yet to be studied. The current investigation is among the first to examine longitudinal data for naturally emerging descriptions of hurtful interactions within romantic relationships. Access to longitudinal data enabled the researchers to measure the long-term and short-term impact of hurtful interactions on romantic relationships. The current study extends existing research by investigating the long- and short-term influence that hurtful interactions have on relational satisfaction and commitment to marriage. Results demonstrated that hurtful messages have a significant short-term impact on relational satisfaction and commitment to marriage. Additional analyses revealed that short-term commitment to marriage was a significant predictor of long-term commitment to marriage. Ultimately our findings suggest that hurtful interactions may not be as harmful to relationships as some tend to believe."

I track down the roots of machismo as a critical analytic category of sex in the writings of Samuel Ramos and Octavio Paz. According to them, machismo is a gender category; however, to theorize machismos roots, they rely on racial and class arguments about hybridity and colonizations. This suggests that machismo is more than a gender category and that is infused with racial and class ideas. The racialization of the term is not often referenced on contemporary uses of the term. These uses have continued eliding the connection between machismo and race, limiting the understanding of masculinity and patriarchy in Mexico."

I analyze activist discourses about gay marriage to reveal how these social actors produced the issue in an effort to transform media stories and images of gay and lesbian life. I also examine how activists critiqued news media constructions of the gay marriage issue, revealing the challenges they faced in attempting to advocate for their cause within the confines of a commercialized media system. This project is ultimately concerned with what the onslaught of media attention surrounding the same-sex marriage issue has meant for the modern gay rights movement, and for LGBT representations more generally. I critically analyze the ways in which becoming the focus of the mainstream news media can potentially reshape the movement, ultimately impacting the strategies activists use to reach their straight allies."

This study content analyzed public relations research appearing in Journal of Communication, Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly and Journal of Applied Communication Research, as well as in Public Relations Review and Journal of Public Relations Research. This first report of findings indicates that little public relations scholarship is making its way into general communication journals. Three of the journals analyzed  Public Relations Review, Journal of Public Relations Research and the Journal of Communication Management  accounted for 96% of all the articles in the study. In addition, the theory development so optimistically foreseen by Sallot et al has not occurred, with only 22% of the articles (similar to the 20% found in the earlier study) fitting into the theory-oriented construct."

Using data from surveys and interviews with users, we determine patterns in the relationship between users and their friends, how the online articulation came to be, and whether relationships tended to move from offline to online or vice versa. We show that the criteria for adding friends depends on the nature of the system as well as such subscriber attributes as their experience, and motivations. Using data from automatic downloading of profile pages, we show the way users categorize friends when they are added to the network. This paper offers an important step in better understanding how friendship links function and will give SNS researchers a platform upon which to base future analyses and data collection efforts."

It emerged in the 1990s and now has spread around the world, under the promotion of the Center for Digital Storytelling (CDS), a nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. This paper attempts to construct a theoretical framework for this facilitative visual production. It first gives a brief introduction of the state of the art in Digital Storytelling, its diverse application, and their empowerment potentials. Then the paper proposes to integrate different theoretical traditions in visual studies in order to formulate a conceptual and theoretical framework that could be used to better comprehend the social dynamics surrounding visual storytelling, facilitation, participation and empowerment. Theories and concepts in the anthropology of visual communication, narrative research, and participatory and alternative media practices are critically reviewed and integrated. It also argues for the use of Digital Storytelling techniques for action-oriented research, and discusses possible the ethic implications."

This paper reports results from a series of focus groups conducted in the Netherlands a year after the referendum. Allowing for some forgetting and subsiding priming effects, the aim was to identify the core components and patterns of the acquired understanding. Manipulating the level of cues and structure in discussion, both spontaneous association patterns and passive knowledge were assessed. The mapped results show that people mainly used media frames to structure the information. Belief content, but also salience, varied less by source than between subjects. While people learned about the main controversies and aspects from the media, they still formed their own opinions. However, different sense-making strategies suggested by media frames fostered, respectively deterred, concern over and participation in European politics."

This paper proposes a policy framework for promoting American global competitiveness by establishing new standards of information and communication access for individuals. Section 254 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which construes an evolving standard of Universal Service, serves as the basis for a new model of Universal Service responsive to innovations in telecommunications."

Identifying and avoiding these behaviors may be especially important for healthcare personnel, who regularly interact with HIV-positive clientele. This interview study examines the perceptions of stigma in healthcare contexts of 50 male American military veterans living with HIV. Participants described a variety of stigmatizing behaviors performed by healthcare personnel, ranging from ambiguous nonverbal cues to blatant discrimination. These findings extend previous research by (a) focusing on healthcare personnels actual behaviors rather than their attitudes and beliefs about HIV-positive patients, (b) including patients perceptions of both clinical and non-clinical healthcare personnel, and (c) identifying potentially stigmatizing behaviors that are unique to healthcare contexts. These findings provide healthcare personnel with a tangible list of behaviors that should either be avoided or further explained to HIV-positive patients, as they may be interpreted as stigmatizing."

Mammys origins are rooted in the cultural, historical and economic climate of the antebellum American South. As the lead domestic servant and child care provider in the white southern household, Mammy is often caricatured as a dark-skinned, fat, cantankerous, yet nurturing, older woman (White, 1984). This paper discusses the mammy icon in three main sections. Part one explores the construction of the mammy myth and its purposes in antebellum America: as a counterpart to another mythologized black female representation  Jezebel; as a representation of ideal blackness and womanhood; and as a justification for the institution of slavery which perpetuated white dominance and enslaved millions of Africans. Part one also surveys Mammys portrayal in American popular media, with special attention to the medium of film, as an extension of that purpose. In part two, I broach the issue of Mammys continued depiction, arguing that the American medias persistent portrayal of black women as the mammy icon sustains the figures original purpose and is therefore an exercise in reinforcing white privilege. Part three builds upon this previous discussion and examines a contemporary image of black womanhood as presented in a popular television media text. In this analysis, I contend that some present-day representations of black women subtly reinforce the mammy myth, by forsaking the traditional physical characteristics associated with the icon, yet embracing the emotional attributes associated with Mammy in ways that align these characters with whiteness."
2007-0886,Managing Cultural Difference in Communication Between Headquarters and Subsidiary/Partners: Practical Approaches and Lessons Learned,Creating Strategic Organizational Communication,,,,Paper,Managing Cultural Difference in Communication Between Headquarters and Subsidiary/Partners: Practical Approaches and Lessons Learned,Creating Strategic Organizational Communication,"This article addresses intercultural issues in business communication between corporate headquarters in Denmark and subsidiaries and alliance partners in Japan. Leading researchers in comparative management studies have investigated how national values and characteristics can be used to determine likely future behavior. Countering this position, other researchers see culture as a collective and relational construct that is continuously being redefined in new contextual settings. Rather than merely looking at national characteristics and values (which are admittedly important within limits), this article presents a study of intercultural communication as complex and dynamic. Based on interviews with 50 global managers in 5 companies the article presents lessons learned and exemplifications of management practice from companies that deal with ongoing cultural clashes to those who turn cultural difference to vantage points."
2007-0887,Managing Hybridity: How the Online Alternative Media Create Public Sphere in Taiwan,"New Media, New Journalism, New Journalists",,,,Paper,Managing Hybridity: How the Online Alternative Media Create Public Sphere in Taiwan,"New Media, New Journalism, New Journalists","The advent of the Internet has raised academic concern of its potential for democratic communications, an ideal diminishing in the mainstream media. The reviving discourses on the public sphere (and counterpublic sphere) have drawn attention of how the alternative media could mobilize civil participation by use of the Internet. A turn from technological determination to elaborative analysis of social context and actors has emerged, when diversity of online media is recognized. This paper focuses on Esouth Newsletterthe reputable online alternative media in Taiwan which carries marginalized voices of social movements. I argue the success of Esouth exemplifies a hybrid communication model that obscures the boundary between mass and alternative media. It borrows some practices of mainstream media, but at the same embodies the spirit of alternative media. The case asks for reflection upon the dualistic thinking of mass/alternative media. Yet it is overoptimistic and unnecessary to expect alternative media to become mainstreaming when commercialism has been eroding the cyberspace."
2007-0888,Managing Journalistic Firebombs: Scandals as Struggle Over Meaning,Journalistic Titillation: Sensationalism and Scandal,,,,Paper,Managing Journalistic Firebombs: Scandals as Struggle Over Meaning,Journalistic Titillation: Sensationalism and Scandal,"Media scandals are professionally produced declarations by the mass media with the potential to journalistic firebombs in society's struggle over meaning, which have not yet been sufficiently analyzed in journalism and communication research. We ascertain the functions of media scandals and present a new research model which enables systematically analysis of the constructive mechanisms of content, control, and critique for scandal communication. The presentation shows how in the age of mass media, scandals have developed into a dangerous weapon of public influence: an information virus with revolutionary explosive force. Key aspects of scandal communication, which so far have been neglected in the research of journalism, can be explained. Taking these perspectives into account, we create a basis for an interdisciplinary scandal research model, which, for the first time, integrates the journalistic processes of media production as well as the strategies of issue management in the media public sphere."

2007-0890,Mapping Global Space and Terror: Arab Americans' and Others' Engagement with Action-Adventure Film,Framing Terrorism and Democracy,,,,Paper,Mapping Global Space and Terror: Arab Americans' and Others' Engagement with Action-Adventure Film,Framing Terrorism and Democracy,"This work explores how Arab American and other U.S.-based communities map global space, fear and danger through their engagement with action-adventure film. While there is extensive literature demonstrating the limited characterization of Arab communities, of Islam, and of the Middle East, in popular as well as news narratives, we know much less about the consequences of these media portrayals. The differences in mapping, based on focus group and survey research, were striking. In discussions of action-adventure settings, Arab American groups and informants were much more likely than their counterparts to specify particular places over more generalized regions, and to be highly critical rather than justify these constructions. These groups' sense of danger in the world at large, dictating concern with travel outside of the known and familiar territory of citizenship, seemed contingent upon cultural identification as well as direct experience. The connection between identification, whether as an American citizen primarily or as an Arab constituent, and fear in the world is critical in understanding how cultural mapping predicates experiences and interpretations."

Nanotechnology is an issue of growing importance for commercial, environmental and governmental bodies who have made increasing use of cyberspace to promote their agenda. The paper will identify the key pro and anti- sites, as well as non-aligned players through an extensive web crawl. Patterns of inter-linkage among the groups mobilised on the issue will then be profiled in terms of the extent of inter-linkage or homophily and/or competitiveness within the two sides of the debate, and whether geographic clustering of sites can be detected? The findings will be used to draw conclusions about the strength of the forces mobilising around the issue and the extent to which they are focusing on the international or national policy making sphere."
2007-0892,"Mapping the Globalization Frame Contest: Social Actors, Mass Media, and Public Opinion",Agenda Setting & Framing,,,,Paper,"Mapping the Globalization Frame Contest: Social Actors, Mass Media, and Public Opinion",Agenda Setting & Framing,"This study examines the frame contest surrounding the issue of globalization that began in the late 1990s as a means to explicate framing processes of social actors and the media and their impact on public opinion. The globalization frame contest offers a rich example of a highly visible and contentious struggle over meaning between social and political actors on a vicarious or abstract issue upon which most Americans were heavily dependent on the media for information. Though an analysis of newspaper content from 1991 to 2004 demonstrates that the dominant frame of globalization within public discourse was transformed within the frame contest, the net public opinion outcome of the contest was a continued permissive consensus toward globalization based upon a new dominant frame of globalization. The studys approach and findings have implications for the development of framing theory within the context of frame contest case studies."

Interactivity in the form of natural mapping has been advocated as a possible contributor to presence experiences, yet few studies to date have investigated this potential, particularly as it applies to video games, which are expected to make extensive use of naturally mapped controllers in the future. This paper formulates a preliminary typology of natural mapping and subsequently addresses how 2 types of natural mapping impact the experience of a video game, with the expectation that more natual mapping leads to increased spatial presence affecting game enjoyment. A total of 78 subjects took part in an experimental investigation manipulating the type of controller used to play a PC driving video game (steering wheel, gamepad, joystick, or keyboard). Following play, subjects completed measures of perceived controller naturalness (included to provide a manipulation check and continuous measure of naturalness), spatial presence, and game enjoyment. Results of the study were generally consistent with expectations, and the implications of the findings are discussed."

Further, it compares the structure of NCA with that of the International Communication Association (ICA), based on the divisions common to both organizations. The result suggests that similar dimensions that differentiate subdisciplines found in previous research -- mass to interpersonal, humanities to social science (Barnett & Danowski, 1992; Lee & Barnett, 2005) -- are applicable to NCA. The result of a comparison between ICA and NCA suggests that there were some differences in structure in both organizations. More scholars in NCA are involved in philosophical Communication Studies and individual-level studies than in ICA. The semantic network analysis discovered that American Studies was the most central division followed by Critical and Cultural Studies. Finally, using members of professional associations as representative samples to map the structure of Communication Studies is validated in this study."

The purpose of this textual analysis is to add to the discourse of heart disease and women by offering new perspectives of what the Heart Truth messages mean, in part by understanding which information is omitted in the messages. So that women can have an offering of triangulated information about the topic of heart disease and how it applies to them, this study hopes to provide alternative perspectives about what the materials offered by the campaign may mean about our culture; about what considerations or elements may have been obscured in the production of the campaign and its messages; and how certain groups of women may have been identified by the producers of women. Literature about social studies of science, communication campaigns, and cultural studies is reviewed, results and analyses are provided, and conclusions about the theoretical implications to feminist technoscientific understandings of health communication campaigns are included."
2007-0896,Marketing the Other for Study Abroad: A Postcolonial Analysis,Minority Matters: Issues of Race in Work and Education,,,,Paper,Marketing the Other for Study Abroad: A Postcolonial Analysis,Minority Matters: Issues of Race in Work and Education,"Over the past decade, representation of racial and cultural Others in tourism media texts has become an important scholarly concern. Researchers working in this area view tourism processes as part of a broad discursive framework, which is inscribed with relationships of power and dominance. These relationships are manifested in and maintained through tourism texts, which are characterized by established representations of destinations that reflect broader social ideologies about race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc., privileging dominant groups at the expense of others. Thus far, however, analyses of tourism media representations have focused predominantly on mass tourism promotional materials produced either by for-profit agencies or by government organizations charged with encouraging local economic development through increased tourism revenues. Lacking has been an assessment of promotional materials produced by non-profit tourism brokers, as exemplified by the phenomenon of university study abroad tourism. This study interrogates the promotional literature of a popular American study abroad program, Semester at Sea (SAS), in order to determine whether its depictions of destinations and people differ from those found in mainstream mass tourism media texts. Grounded in post-colonial theory, and employing a three-pronged method of content, semiotic, and discourse analysis, it argues that while SAS embraces a mission of promoting cross-cultural understanding and global citizenship, the program nevertheless continues to (re)produce hegemonic depictions of non-westerners, asserting a western superiority ideology by polarizing the West and the Rest into binaries of modern/traditional, technologically advanced/backward, and master/servant, and decomplexifying the globalization process by presenting the non-West as exotic, culturally pristine, and filled with happy natives."

This paper begins with an examination of khaki media, those media most enthusiastic and supportive of the war on terror. Yet in addition to examining the role of masculinity in the media work of more khaki personalities such as Bill OReilly and Rush Limbaugh, this paper will also examine the work of a key media personality known to be opposed to the Bush administration, Jon Stewart of The Daily Show. As feminist research has shown us, the step-by-step process of militarization in which society comes to depend on militaristic ideas as primary means of solving problems occurs in myriad ways and often involves ostensibly oppositional forces as well as those most clearly calling for war. The Daily Show has become extremely popular among the lucrative young male demographic in the U.S. and it is therefore worthwhile to better understand how this show and how it constructs its unique brand of masculinity. This paper uses a feminist and postcolonial framework to analyze The Daily Show and assess its role in maintaining or challenging the process of militarization, given the common perception of the show as oppositional to the status quo."

The Interplay of Political Schemata and the Media Agenda in Political Information Processing,Agenda Setting,"The objective of our study is to consider both the schema-theory and the agenda-setting approach in research on political information processing. In the context of the television debates during the German Bundestag election 2002 we therefore analyzed the perception of 25 young adults using a multimethod design: Before the debates took place the participants schemata on political issues were surveyed by a standardized questionnaire. After having watched the debates participants were asked to write down the debates issues they remember. Additionally, we conducted a content analysis of both debates. Results indicate that recipients pay more attention to political issues which are already part of their schema. Hence, they remember those issues better than others. We conclude from this that future research should particularly focus on the interplay of the recipients schema and the media agenda. Our results underline that a further inclusion of schema theory in the agenda-setting model is necessary to better comprehend the process of political information processing."

This study explores the relationship between corrective action and organization learning. Specifically, the corrective actions taken by the City of Minot and Ward County officials in response to the emergency communication breakdowns during the 2002 Canadian Pacific train derailment and anhydrous ammonia spill are analyzed. The study concludes that corrective action when employed as organizational learning can expedite image restoration and better prepare organizations for future crises."
2007-0900,Meaning,formation and Meaning: A Dialogue,,,,Paper,Meaning,Information and Meaning: A Dialogue,"The concept of meaning is key to several traditions in the history of ideas  rhetoric, hermeneutics, phenomenology, and semiotics  all of which have been important sources of communication theory. Each tradition has sought, in distinctive ways, to account for the interrelations between the material vehicles of meaning, individual interpretation, and cultural tradition. In the field of communication, these traditions have combined with empirical social science, not least anthropology and sociology, to examine meaning production as a socially situated process. While such studies have frequently given priority to qualitative methodologies, meaning may be conceptualized and operationalized in both quantitative and qualitative, stochastic as well as intentional terms. The paper presents a four-fold typology of meaning, comprising deterministic, indeterministic, stochastic, and generative variants. Examples from previous research suggest that this conceptual framework may help to specify the complementarity of different approaches to information and meaning."

Here facial electromyography (EMG) has proved to be particularly useful. While practical problems of recording EMG have been addressed in the last two decades with the availability of mature and cost-effective solutions, as well as common standards and procedures, it is time to readdress the issue of reliability of facial responses as indicators of affective states. I will review some critical evidence relating the moderating influence of social context on facial affective responses and present some original research on the potential underlying psychological processes. Specifically 2 competing theoretical approaches, Paul Ekmans neurocultural theory of emotion, which includes the concept of display rules, and Alan Fridlunds behavioral ecology theory will be contrasted. For many years social effects on facial activity have been addressed in applied contexts, such as the assessment of affective reactions to media, by recording participants in social isolation. This is thought to counter the effect of cultural display rules. However, Fridlund and others could demonstrate that effects of implicit sociality moderate facial activity even when people are physically alone. However, neither of the 2 dominating views on the relationship of emotions and expressive behavior can procedurally explain effects of implicit sociality. The present research is anchored in a social cognition framework and empirically investigates automatic links between underlying concepts and the effect of such links on overt behavior."

Using a health competence framework (based on a synthesis of health literacy and social capital perspectives), the paper examines the relationship between an individuals level of health competence and six types of program exposure measures ranging from general (media habits) to specific (self-reported learning from recalled CHL messages). Data derived from a population-based 2004-2005 panel survey of 2073 married women aged 15-49, 1891 husbands, and 1716 never married youth aged 15-24 show different patterns of exposure by gender, age, marital status and level of health competence as well as interaction effects of health competence and exposure on the number of positive health behaviors practiced."

What is so far missing is a long-term empirical analysis of actual media coverage of the peace process on the publics attitudes toward peace. This study attempts to provide such an analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the attitudes toward peace among Israelis. It shows that actual levels of aggregate support for the Oslo agreement are highly predicted by media framing, even after controlling for the actual status of the process. Yet, as predicted by prospect theory, the destructive effects of negative media coverage on the public support for peace are considerably stronger than the positive effects of supportive information. Responses to media framing are generally rational, although some automatic responses were detected as a consequence of the activation of associative networks."

The critic often concerns the lack of in-depth analyses and the construction of dichotomies like Islam and the West guiding people to live and act according to imagined divisions that appear as absolute. The starting point of this paper is however different since it explicitly seeks to locate discourses aimed at balancing negative and biased reporting. In search for challenging stereotypes and signs of improved journalistic awareness, a controversial tendency was noted. The tendency concerns media texts endorsing values of anti-racism and equality but still containing strong features of control thus contributing to a media output that never threatens nor challenges consensus supporting journalism. For understanding this tendency and for clarifying the medias role in identity construction processes, it is argued that one has to explore the nature of the multi-ethnic public sphere and the interface between the notions of visibility, voice and the representation of difference. The paper proposed is predominantly of theoretical character but findings from case studies (both quantitative and qualitative), conducted on newspapers in two North European countries, function as a contribution to the arguments put forward."

The daily radio program Democracy Now is in some ways symbolic of the growing popularity of this genre. Fueled by movements like media reform, global justice and anti-war, as well as broad displeasure with corporate media consolidation (McChesney, 2004), Democracy Now has grown its distribution to over 400 public and community media outlets around the country. In this study, Democracy Now is placed in a typology of independent media, and is used as a model for proposing changes in the application of sourcing, news agenda setting and indexing theories to a class of independent media that display a centralized organizational structure and an institutional content focus. Through an analysis of social movement websites, I have found that by pegging their news agenda to political and economic elites, and then indexing the range of debate to critical journalists and social movement actors, Democracy Now may provide a symbolic resource (Eyerman & Jamison, 1991; Melucci, 1996) that facilitates the formation and maintenance of traditional, government focused North American social movements (McAdam, Tarrow, & Tilly, 2001)."

This paper describes how these frames reveal the episodic construction of U.S. credibility through what Zhongdang Pan and Gerald Kosicki have called ""strategic framing."" Through an analysis of media arguments made around the Haditha Massacre incident in Iraq and the Lebanon War in 2006, this paper explores how framing strategies reveal specific argument moves that sustain perceptions of United States credibility. The narrative construction of credibility is described as a ""strategic"" framing objective. This analysis seeks to further elaborate the notion of media frames in the context of Arab editorial content, while highlighting the international dimension of media-based argument. This paper illuminates how these media strategies entrench intercultural divides and complicate U.S. attempts at international communication programs and dialogue-based public diplomacy initiatives."

relation between media use and political engagement among young American
adults, ages 18-25. Joining a growing body of qualitative research on media
and public connection, the paper argues that claims about the demise of
participation in the public sphere tend to simplify the nature of engagement
and media consumption. In addition, they tend to undertheorize the nature
of the public sphere. Applying an interpretive cultural anthropology lens,
this study takes the meaning of being engaged or disengaged as an
empirically investigatable question, whose answer in large part takes shape
through the words, categories, and practices of the people being studied.
The research employs methods of ethnographic participant-observation,
interviews, and focus groups with a cross-section of young adults in
Atlanta.

For the most part the FCC has opted for an anti-trust framework, and has positioned its public interest mandate inside the new anti-trust orientation. The anti-trust framework puts great weight on the presumed substitutability of media products and how difficult it is to discern the product market or the geographic market in media. This paper will suggest that the anti-trust framework adopted by the FCC contains an inherent bias of the national over the local with respect to media ownership policy. In a commercial media system with many more media outlets but fewer owners, the FCCs assumption of media abundance further undermines the old localism standard  the social benefit and necessity of local media coverage of local issues."

Today more than ever, girls sexuality is at the center of a storm. Sex is a battleground in contemporary society, as anyone keeping track of news headlines is well aware. In the first decade of a new millennium, questions of girls sexuality are being hotly contested in worldwide public arenas. As our understandings of gender and sexuality grow more complex, and new technologies emerge that are reshaping the context of sexual behavior and activity, the open debates about what is right, normal or acceptable in the once-clandestine realm of minors sexuality grow more intense. In light of this, what is the role of the media in the social construction of girls sexuality?

Certain corporate behaviour that is deemed acceptable at one point in time may be viewed as unacceptable at a later stage. Thus, it is important to grasp discourses about CSR and how they change, and the media is the foremost arena where these discourses and new demands are articulated. On the one hand, critical journalists might be eager to expose misbehaviour and companies that do not follow up on their grand CSR promises or act contrary to their ethics declarations. On the other hand, CSR initiatives might also receive and merit positive media coverage according to other news values. This paper investigates how central Norwegian media outlets covered some selected CSR initiatives during 2006. Rhetorical theory is used to frame the analysis. The results from such an analysis can be used to inform future CSR initiatives, anticipate and address rightful and/or wrongful criticism."

Other researchers state that news is all about storytelling with media having a vital social function within society. In this paper we take the media as storytellers as our starting point and compare their news coverage with Greek Tragedies. In doing so, we construct a theoretical framework of the role of the media during scandals. Using a content analysis of the news coverage about this scandal we subsequently applied the model. We found that the model provides a good point of departure when analyzing the role of the media during scandals. Although more research is needed, the model proved to be very useful as tool to come to a typology of media roles during different types of scandals."

Taking this question as a starting point I want to argue based on empirical research that one aspect of the mediatization of religion is its branding: The forms of our present media cultures also structure the production and representation of religion around specific sacred brands (the pope, for example) that make religious messages pointedly communicable in fragmented media landscapes. Such a branding of religion at the side of media production and representation is related to the individualised belief at the level of media appropriation: Clear brands and symbols offer an orientation for a personal religious bricolage. While these arguments are developed in the paper focusing on the Catholic Church as an example it is argued that processes of branding religion are a general tendency of religious change in media cultures."

2007-0916,Media Dynamics: How Many Mediatic Turns!?,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,,,,Paper,Media Dynamics: How Many Mediatic Turns!?,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,"Media change shows a mixed or hyper-dynamics. At different levels from micro to macro, within different domains of production, distribution/diffusion and reception, and - not at least - with different media we observe a mix of
processes running at different speeds, depending on changes of numerous variables from politics to technology and from economy to culture, with different impact on the individual, society and business. Media change at the large scale, thus, results from linear processes, oszillations and cycles, turbulences, resonances, structural and
organisational changes, dissipations and fluctuations, from evolutions and revolutions taking place at the same time within the heterogenious, heteromorphic and heterosemiotic field of media processes. The paper will examine the conditions and mechanisms of media change to theoretically and empirically clarify the ""nature"" those changes which might be taken as ""mediatic turns""."
2007-0917,Media Education Under the Auspices of the Mediatic Turn,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,,,,Paper,Media Education Under the Auspices of the Mediatic Turn,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,"Although no coherent and generally accepted theory of media education is in sight, a few remarkable characteristics can be figured out. For example, it is noticeable that quite frequently patterns of thought and argumentation present the relationship between reality and media reality in such a way as if the media could be added to actual reality or not. This calls for more basic reflection in media pedagogy by reverting to elements from media theory and media philosophy. The discourse of the 'mediatic turn' provides occasions for the clarification of some basics of media pedagogy and media education. What does it mean when we do not consider media an optional dimension which can be added to the determination of education, socialisation, communication, society and culture or not? I will sound out the relevance of the 'mediatic turn' for media education with respect to questions of media competence, understandings of critique, and the relation of education and media education."
2007-0918,Media Effects on Vote for Governing Parties: The Role of Media Bias and Fluidity of the Political Context Among European Countries,Voters & Voting,,,,Paper,Media Effects on Vote for Governing Parties: The Role of Media Bias and Fluidity of the Political Context Among European Countries,Voters & Voting,"Although the contingent nature of media effects has been a staple of media research, and recent research often makes even a direct reference to it, a systematic account of the conditions that could explain the observed variance in political media effects has not been developed. This research aims at exactly this gap in the literature. The micro logic of the Zaller model is extended to the macro level and used in comparing countries and media systems leading to an explicit theorizing and modelling of the interactions between the micro and macro levels of 2 principal factors thought to influence the likelihood of media effects: (1) The characteristics of attitudes, which delimit the marge de maneuvre that the mass media may have in influencing political opinions, attitudes and behaviour; and (2) The characteristics of the media messages (diversity vs. one sidedness), which determine the degree to which there are observable media effects. These factors vary both at the micro and at the macro level. The interaction between the two levels makes certain people in certain contexts particularly prone to reliance on mass media in forming their opinions. The theory is tested through secondary analysis of European Social Survey (ESS) data using multi-level modelling. Even the saturated model supports some of the claims of the theory, such as that media effects are more likely being boosted under conditions of high volatility and for those with weak partisanship. Intriguing results regarding the direction of impact of media bias are also noteworthy."

Despite the very different societal and cultural context of the three age cohorts involved in this qualitative study, it can be argued that media and the increasing global news flow, has, in fact, created very similar generational experiences in the nine countries involved. Based on Karl Mannheims concept of entelechy of generations, results of the project reveal generational specific ways of media related world construction through (1) notions of distance and proximity and (2) analogue and digital world knowledge."

The concept of framing is introduced to: (1) bridge the existing gap between content analyses and effect studies in the research area of alcohol and the mass media, and to (2) make subtle differentiations in types of alcohol portrayals at the production side and in different effects at the reception side. A qualitative, inductive frame analysis of both seasons 1 and 2 of The OC, revealed 2 dominant frames: the Obligatory outlet frame, based on the idea that people must live their life to the fullest; and the Escapism frame, based on the cultural phenomenon of people escaping reality when problems arise. The Learn to celebrate without the sauce frame, which contests the idea the drinking alcohol is the norm, is almost absent."

Yet, such efforts are held hostage by the increasingly conservative intellectual property policies promoted by lawyers at our own institutions. A literacy scholar writing about literature has some sense of how much they can quote in a printed work of criticism. A media literacy teacher will often be told that all forms of quotation involve copyright infringement. What the law says may differ from what rights a media company asserts or what a university attorney will defend. Speaking from personal experience, I will discuss how this particular interpretation of copyright law is constraining or deforming the development of media literacy materials."

Gans ideal of a multiperspectival press  one that represents the broadest possible range of views -- offers a compelling alternative. Understanding how and why some media outlets, or national media systems, are more multiperspectival or multivocal than others presents an exciting new research agenda. This paper presents comparative case study findings that the French press is more multivocal than the U.S. press. This difference can be attributed at least in part to what Barnhurst and Nerone have termed the form of news. For example, for any given news story, French media outlets group related articles into story ensembles as opposed to the typical catch-all single article in the U.S. press; in addition, the French press tends to mix diverse news genres (commentaries, editorials, breaking news, interviews, etc.) normally kept separate in the U.S. context."

Findings include a high print-media focus on risk generators even though they are used less frequently than employees and their families as sources of information, with little use of sources or focus on risk advocates, informers, researchers and arbiters. Advocated plot lines in metro and national print-media coverage focused on an irresponsible industry, as opposed to local focus on a powerless community."

Media coverage and treatment of news has a very significant importance on public perception with regard to the corporate responsible behaviour of companies. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the level of visibility of CSR activities of companies in the newspapers, and what tone is assigned to this news. We present the results of the research done on the CSR news of companies belonging to the Spanish Stock Exchange in the most important newspapers (El País, La Vanguardia, El Mundo and ABC) in Spain. The results suggest that CSR activities of companies practically do not appear in the media, but information published on this issue has a high positive tone of voice."

I draw on qualitative data from a larger action-research project with 17 teens to explore how media practices and media talk are implicated in the (re)construction of gendered identities and subjectivities. Although I frame the discussion by Judith Butlers (1990) notion of gender as performativity, I consider the intersection of gender with nation and ethnicity and reflect on the ways in which the teens negotiate the gender norms of different societies to construct a culturally hybrid gendered identity.

Initially, media richness for various media was thought to be static across users. The level of media richness of a medium was thought to dictate a degree of desirability for the use of such a medium in communication situations depending upon the equivocality of those situations. Later research demonstrated that media richness is not a static feature but more of a perception of a user. Both early and later research have strengths that arent shared. Given that throughout the research of media richness, the focus has always been on making a proper media decision based on the needs of a situation, the relational interpersonal communication competence framework offers a means by which the strengths of the early and later research of media richness may be combined. By means of an online questionnaire, interpersonal competence was shown to have a relationship with both early and later media richness research. Suggestions for future research involving media richness, interpersonal competence, and media selection are included."
2007-0932,"Media Systems in Transition: Poland, Russia, China",Top Papers in International and Development Communication,,,,Paper,"Media Systems in Transition: Poland, Russia, China",Top Papers in International and Development Communication,"This paper offers an alternative to the dominant theory of transition, which was developed partly in relation to the Latin American experience. In its place, the article resumes the theory of elite continuity developed to explain changes in the central European post-communist countries in the 1990s. The article tests whether this approach can (a) be extended in time to explain the political realities of the mass media after a decade of social change and (b) whether it can be extended in space to explain the political realities of the mass media in other societies in which the nature of transition has been different. While we can in the Polish case make an argument for a relatively successful transition to democracy, Russia is often seen to have regressed from the immediate post-communist period towards a more authoritarian order, and China, while have experienced rapid and successful marketization, remains a communist dictatorship. The article examines the relationship of the mass media to political life in these 3 countries and finds a surprising number of similarities. The theory of elite continuity, for which there is now more substantial empirical evidence, explains these processes much better than do available alternatives. In one important respect, the stress upon the necessity of a political revolution to break the hold of the Communist Party, the theory that was developed to explain the central European cases requires modification, since the Chinese experience demonstrates that it is possible for the elite to recompose itself without any substantial political transformation."

Also known affectionately as the Crocodile Hunter, Irwin burst upon the international scene in 1992. During the next 14 years he mesmerized millions of television viewers through his programs, films and television specials broadcast on Animal Planet. Through a web-based survey, more than 1800 media consumers from the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada shared their responses to Steve Irwins death. Results show that Irwin was considered to be a hero and an influential role model for wildlife conservation. As hypothesized, those most involved with Irwin were more likely to increase their support of wildlife conservation and give financial donations to Wildlife Warriors, Irwins conservation. Implications of these findings on the international influence of popular celebrities are discussed."

The attention funnel is an AR technique conceived as a general purpose, omnidirectional 3D cursor that can be used in mobile settings to: (1) direct attention, (2) allow users to point at and select 3D objects, and (3) allow users to manipulate virtual objects by moving the hand in various ways. The two experiments reported here were designed to examine one of the features of the attention funnel interface - the ability to direct attention allowing for speeded search for objects in near space. The primary comparison was speeded search performance across conditions where search was guided by the attention funnel and search guided by a simpler, more limited, but effective interface  a 3D arrow. Both the attention funnel and 3D arrow provided marked improvements in search time compared to an un-aided control condition that mimics the confusion of target searches today. Likely due to its simplicity, the 3D arrow provided a small, but consistent, advantage in search speed compared to the attention funnel."

It also argues that Iranian media have embodied contradictory tendencies in their functions as institutions of civil society, as an extension of the state, and as the voice of the opposition. In the absence of sanctioned political parties opposing the prevailing power structure, media have played a significant political role. Studying Iranian media and their relationship to the state and to the entities outside the state allows us to recalibrate our understanding of the relationships between media, state, and society by providing components for comparative media analyses in international communication."

This research asks how processes of mediation shape these self-representations in public sector projects in the cultural sphere. Three overlapping but distinct processes of mediation were examined: institutional, textual (including technological) and cultural. The empirical analysis explored the production processes in two cases: BBC Wales Capture Wales and The Museum of Londons Londons Voices. The case studies were multi-method, including in-depth interviews and observations with participants and producers, and the textual analysis of selected self-representations. The empirical analysis suggested that processes of mediation in Londons Voices and Capture Wales are constituted through a series of tensions, both challenging and productive, in four key areas: Purposes; Quality; Ordinary people and Community"". In the final section of the paper these tensions are explored using work on participatory media, mediation, and theories of governmentality."

This paper examines the creation of amateur cultural productions among families. Focusing upon detailed case studies of digital media projects, including a father and son collaborating to create a podcast and a family endeavor to develop a young girls music career through the recording, remixing and promotion, this paper examines how such collaborative projects may create a space for parents and kids to communicate. Exploring the extent to which these collaborations may encourage families to transcend traditional hierarchies, the material entices us to explore the degree to which egalitarianism is an inherent property of amateur cultural productions.

The research extends previous work in organizational justice to a community setting with local scientists evaluated according to four social-psychological dimensions of justice  distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational. The results show that science news attention had positive relationship with the perceived distributive, procedural, and interpersonal justice of local scientists. Exposure to local newspapers was positively associated with procedural and interpersonal justice. The conclusions argue that justice constructs can help media researchers better understand societys relationship with authorities."

In only four of 21 recent cases did federal circuit courts hold that journalists could qualify for asylum under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act. Thus the majority of journalists whose claims were examined had to return to the countries in which they had been persecuted and, often, subjected to government-sanctioned violence. Courts generally have struggled to define what constitutes a particular social group for purposes of U.S. immigration law, and it is proposed that Congress and the U.S. executive branch should clarify in statute and regulation that persecuted journalists are entitled to U.S. asylum."

Through these strategies, the fathers try to do what they want and need to do personally and professionally, while also maintaining involvement, interdependence, and connectedness with their family members and local or professional communities. Thus, the themes operate as work-family management strategies but also as discourses underlying shifting dialectic tensions of autonomy-interconnection, masculinity-femininity, and reality-fantasies that enable them to account for the particularities in their mundane work-family management."

The present investigation addresses these issues by focusing on disclosures about HIV. Using a multiple goals perspective, 24 disclosure messages (representing 6 different types) were created. Participants (N = 548) were asked to imagine one of their siblings revealing an HIV-positive diagnosis, using one of the 24 messages. Participants reactions to the disclosures differed substantially across the various message types. The discussion focuses on theoretical explanations for the variations in responses, the importance of examining disclosure recipients, implications for multiple goals perspectives, and the utility of the present findings for practical interventions concerning HIV disclosures."

But not all emotions are equally gratifying for all recipients. Some love suspense, others prefer fun and merriment, still others seek negative emotions like sadness, or fear and shock. The concept of meta-emotion has provided a useful framework for studying media users' emotional preferences. Whereas existing research has mostly considered meta-emotions as trait variables, this paper focuses on the state aspect of meta-emotion  i.e. on people's occurrent sense of liking or disliking emotions during media use. Development of a state measure of liking/disliking emotions is reported. Results supported discriminant validity of state meta-emotion and hedonic valence as well as convergent validity of state meta-emotion with media enjoyment. The paper concludes with an outlook reporting a qualitative interview study on emotion-related gratifications that might account for positive meta-emotions."

The study proposes that the tropes persuasive outcomes derive from an emergent structural match between linguistic and conceptual metaphor. To test this proposition, 3 hypotheses related to metaphors effect in the domain of alcohol consumption were tested by manipulating novel and conventional linguistic metaphor and measuring dominant conceptual metaphor in a field setting with patrons of bars and other alcohol-serving establishments as research participants. Results provided moderate support for the predictions."

In this study, 167 journal articles, book chapters, and books were examined for the ways the publications discussed features such as theoretical frameworks, conceptual and operational definitions, research methods, conclusions, and suggestions for future research. It compares the findings to previous metaresearches of development communication research conducted in the 1958-to-1986 and 1987-to-1996 time periods. The results indicate that (1) some features of development communication research have remained consistent over time (e.g., most researchers conclude that development communication has a positive effect on individuals and social structures); (2) some features of development communication research appear to be cyclical (e.g., Lerners model of media and modernization informed many development communication studies in 1958-1986 and 1997-2005, but none in 1987-1996); and (3) there were some important changes over time (e.g., gender issues have received increasing attention).

We sought to gain access to what children laugh about on TV. The variety of methods applied include  different types of interviews, group discussions, observations, questionnaires, and an innovative method called the Fun-O-Meter that allows children to rate TV programs moment by moment.
This critical overview will discuss what is measured with the different methodical approaches. Is it possible to research what is funny in TV for children at all? Different methods lead to interesting perspectives on humor communication, but each one is limited. Some are helpful especially for intercultural comparison; others seem to be vulnerable of producing artifacts or just stressing stereotypes. The issue is even more complicated if the aim is to enhance quality humor in childrens television by means of instructing producers from all over the world."

This paper investigates how this identityand especially its manifestation in QEfacilitates three important processes: media corporation-advertiser synergy; legitimating heterosexual masculine consumerism around products not traditionally coded straight-male, such as cosmetics and spa treatments; and queering television. Media accounts of metrosexuals take pains to emphasize their heterosexuality while encouraging their sartorial and cosmetic savvy, constituting them as poster children for urban affluence and consumerism (particularly in the realms of personal appearance and home decor). That metrosexual heterosexuality is continually emphasized while bringing into play traditional feminine qualities illustrates that ossified notions of femininity and masculinity work to constitute metrosexuality in todays hyper-commercial media environment."

Based on second-level agenda setting and framing theories, the authors performed a quantitative analysis of 161 articles and a qualitative analysis of 36 articles in U.S. newspapers from August 2005 through April 15, 2006. Findings indicated that Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador received more coverage (59.6%) than Felipe Calderon (29.1%) or Roberto Madrazo (27.8%). Candidate attributes were highlighted more than Mexican domestic or Mexico-U.S. issues. The dominant procedural frame was the election horse race. The main substantive frame was the election as an extension of U.S.-Mexico economic relations and an extension of Latin American leftist/populist movements. The expatriate voting law was characterized as unsuccessful because of apathetic voters, the Mexican governments faulty implementation, and a corrupt system."
2007-0950,Michael Moore's Muckraking: The Reinvention of TV Newsmagazines in the Age of Spin and Entertainment,Where News & Politics Meets Entertainment,,,,Paper,Michael Moore's Muckraking: The Reinvention of TV Newsmagazines in the Age of Spin and Entertainment,Where News & Politics Meets Entertainment,"This paper examines Michael Moores satirical newsmagazine shows on network and cable television from the mid-to-late 1990sTV Nation and The Awful Truth. The analysis highlights the ways in which Moore mimicked the generic conventions of the newsmagazine format to offer biting political commentary on political and social issues rarely discussed in such an unruly manner. Moores techniques draw attention to the controlling nature of political and corporate language. By making the silent speak, he displays the areas of democratic discourse that are typically off-limits. By turning scripted engagements on their head, he disturbs the familiar and the predictable. Moores approach, then, elevates messy debate over the controlled publicity that has taken its place in the public sphere. This paper details the production aspects associated with offering such groundbreaking political humor on advertiser-supported television, and then analyzes the various patterns of reporting that comprised the show, including the inter-textual features that gave the programming its entertaining yet powerful critical perspective. The paper concludes by examining the importance of Moores contribution to the nascent sub-genre of political entertainment television and that genres overt and implicit criticism of news media as ineffective agents for monitoring and critiquing power in America."
2007-0951,Microlevel Agenda-Setting Effects of News Sites,Broadening the Scope of Agenda Setting Theory,,,,Paper,Microlevel Agenda-Setting Effects of News Sites,Broadening the Scope of Agenda Setting Theory,"This study analyzed agenda-setting effects among major news sites by focusing on microscopic changes in their individual news agendas updated every 10 minutes in a single day. The New York Times on the Web, The New York Times news site, had stronger influence on the individual agenda of CNN.com than CNN.com did on the newspaper site. This finding implies the applicability of the influence of major newspapers on television networks to the online news environment. There was reciprocal influence between The New York Times on the Web and The Wall Street Journal online. Similar bidirectional influence was further found in the relationship between Reuters.com and CNN.com, and that between Reuters.com and The Wall Street Journal online."
2007-0952,Micropractices of Knowing During Employment Interviews: Situated Interplay Between the File-Self and the Real-Self,Knowledge and Knowing in Organizations,,,,Paper,Micropractices of Knowing During Employment Interviews: Situated Interplay Between the File-Self and the Real-Self,Knowledge and Knowing in Organizations,"We examine a distinction between a persons real-self and file-self within organizations. The first has a body that moves and talks, but can only be in one location at a time; the second exists on paper that can be copied and distributed, but is mute until read, impotent until regarded. This is a study of videotaped employment interviews, when a job applicants real-self and file-self are brought together in the same room. During these events, recruiters use files as more than containers of information: They use files to align with the applicant, to move the conversation forward, to manage emotional energy, to ask challenging questions, and more. We lift the lid on real behavior to show how a recruiters subtle behaviors (vocal and visible) can bring an applicants real-self and file-self jointly into play. We show how knowledge workor knowingwithin organizations involves micro-practices that invoke relation states and information states among people and things. Our unique contribution to research on employment interviews is made possible by our ethnomethodological and multimodal approach to the study of videotaped interactions."
2007-0953,Middle Eastern Perspectives and Communication Rights: The Expanding Boundaries of Gendered Communication as a Political Space,Creating Communication Rights: Perspectives on the Emergence of a Global Social Movement,,,,Paper,Middle Eastern Perspectives and Communication Rights: The Expanding Boundaries of Gendered Communication as a Political Space,Creating Communication Rights: Perspectives on the Emergence of a Global Social Movement,"Participation and freedom of expression have always been considered highly political issues, but have been addressed mostly from a Western point of view that reflected a liberal conception of the nexus between democratic practice and communication. Yet the political dimension of actions, initiatives and issue framing around communication and information should not be bounded to what is traditionally considered political communication, meaning electoral communication and changes in political processes due to the ever growing influence of media tools, channels and logics. The political meaning of everyday practices in the use of the means of communication and in approaches to information sharing is also an important phenomenon. By reviewing Middle Eastern perception and reframing of Western political rhetoric this paper offers a culturally-specific reading of the need to rethink the nexus between communication practices and democratic concepts and development. The paper also examines if and how experiences that pertain to practices of communication critique in regional contexts can contribute to global efforts to articulate and promote information justice and communication rights."
2007-0954,"Mimicry, Facial Similarity, and Persuasion in a Collaborative Virtual Environment",The Practice of Virtual Teams,,,,Paper,"Mimicry, Facial Similarity, and Persuasion in a Collaborative Virtual Environment",The Practice of Virtual Teams,"Previous research has shown that the positive reception of persuasive messages can be increased by similarity in gesture (i.e. mimicry) as well as similarity of facial features. Both of these notions have been separately tested in experimental settings using embodied artificial intelligence agents in immersive virtual reality. Unlike previous studies, the present study concurrently examined these concepts in order to gauge the effect of consistency of multiple similarity parameters on social influence. In this 2 x 2 study, an embodied agent in an immersive virtual reality simulation either mimicked a participants head movements at a 4-s delay or utilized prerecorded movements of another participant as it verbally presented an argument. Further, for half of the participants, the face of the agent was morphed, presenting a blend composed of 60% of an unfamiliar Caucasian and 40% of the face of the participant. The other half of the participants was presented with an unfamiliar face; the agents face was morphed with an unfamiliar participants face. The agents that both mimicked and were morphed (i.e., exhibited consistently similar features) with the participant were more persuasive than other agents, despite participants inability to explicitly detect the mimicry or morphing. These data support previous research by showing that automatic, indiscriminate mimicking (i.e., a computer algorithm blindly applied to all movements) and face morphing can be used to gain social influence, as well as research that demonstrates how important it is to maintain consistency among features in animated characters."

We first of all discuss in some detail the methodology of the Time Use Survey (§ 2). A description is then provided of the diffusion of the pc and Internet in the Netherlands (§ 3) and of the time use of these new media (§ 4). In the next paragraph (§ 5) the relationship between the use of new and old media (printed media, radio and television) is discussed. Subsequently the attention is focused on the use of media as a source of information and differences between educational groups with respect to the use of these sources (§ 6)."
2007-0956,Minority Influence in Distributed Groups: A Comparison of Four Theories of Minority Influence,The Practice of Virtual Teams,,,,Paper,Minority Influence in Distributed Groups: A Comparison of Four Theories of Minority Influence,The Practice of Virtual Teams,"This study examined social influence within computer-mediated groups, and how members' geographic dispersion and argument consistency affect individual and group decisions. Competing predictions were derived from several theories which were applicable but untested in the domain of online interaction: double minority effects, the black sheep effect, congruity theory applied to groups, and the minority leniency contract framework. On-line groups were created that had 4 collocated members, or 4 geographically-distributed members, or 2 collocated and 2 isolated members. Groups were provided a biased distribution, or hidden profile of information, and individuals submitted decision preferences prior to discussion resulting in 24 groups with a minority opinion holder geographically isolated or in proximity with one or more other members. The patterns of minority members influence on majority members decisions lent greatest support to the black sheep effect, congruity, and minority leniency approaches, depending on the respective location of the minority opinion holders and the consistency with which they argued their positions."

Drawing on concepts of hegemony and racism, a textual analysis was used to examine 136 articles mentioning King and 44 articles mentioning Malcolm X. Coverage of each man was compared with the other for evidence of framing. The study found four recurring themes surrounding the coverage of these two men: the diminishment of Malcolm X as a leader, a mistrust and skepticism of Malcolm X and the Black Muslims, a deep fear of racial violence, and the stigmatization of Malcolm X. Through this framing, Malcolm X was labeled as a deviant while Martin Luther King, Jr., was embraced as a righteous leader. These characterizations reinforced hegemonic power structures while also supporting ideological notions of accepted racial norms in the United States."

Participation in this type of community facilitates the development of an emergent form of media literacy steeped in amateur culture and the do-it-yourself (DIY) ethic. Particularly for children and teens, fan production is a unique opportunity to develop the skills and dispositions essential to understanding and navigating a complex and dynamic media environment. Focusing on the cultivation of media literacy through one particular type of production-podcasting-this paper investigates how consumption and production practices operate within the Harry Potter fandom and what young people learn through fan production. In addition, the paper raises questions about the costs and/or barriers to access youth face as participants in amateur culture.

Effective missioning, or selling what the organization does, is an important first step in building identification with and commitment to ones nonprofit organization. Formal mission statements are an integral component of organizations overall missioning strategies. Communicating these mission statements meaningfully to the next generation of constituents requires both successful Internet implementation as well as incorporation of prominent rhetorical frames. This study provides baseline data on the online availability of 100 New York City nonprofit organizations mission statements. Additionally, a content analysis of 83 New York City nonprofit organizations mission statements yielded three common rhetorical frames related to the purposes and goals of the nonprofit sector. This research provides a foundation from which to assess the successfulness of nonprofit organizations overall missioning efforts."

In this essay I will discuss a website for mixed-race users that outs mixed-race stars who are commonly thought to be white. Mixedfolks.com is a community of fans and users who claim their right to participate in how stars ought to be represented racially, and in so doing work to form their own identities as mixed-race individuals. Users who didnt know that comedian Rob Schneider is half Filipino, that actresses Jennifer Beals, Halle Berry, and Mariah Carey are half African American, and that Mercedes Ruehl, Madeleine Stowe, and Lynda Carter are part Latina are put straight on the sites homepage. These people are all claimed as mixedfolks, whether they claim themselves in that way or not. The site attempts to resolve the problem of missing role models for mixed-race folks or Web users by identifying listing actors, musicians, and other mixed-race celebrities who are often assumed to be white by many viewers and connecting them to their hidden racial backgrounds."

This paper considers how people negotiate the symbolic meanings of mobile communication technology in an intercultural context. That is, when the social space is not defined by the cultural norms of a single nation, but rather defined by an arena of intercultural encounters, how do people negotiate the symbolic meanings of mobile communication technology? Drawing on data from focus group interviews of college students from various nations who attend an international college, this paper examines the way young people negotiate an intercultural social space via mobile communication technology as they perceive, define, and express the self."

Coupled with the fact that as Roach (2005) reports, two-thirds of American college students swap or download copyrighted files including software, music and movies, the pervasive use of mobile technologies has created an interesting dynamic which demands further exploration. College students have traditionally been active consumers of new technologies; however, MP3 and iPod technologies are constructed through their innate portability, to allow use both in private and public environments thus creating a blurring of public and private space. Further, this increase in use has resulted in the construction of norms. Drawing on focus group interviews of college students, this paper explores how college students incorporate potentially isolating technologies into their everyday lives. That is, this study examines how college students overcome these isolating technologies so as to use them as community-building mechanisms and a means to their personal goals."

It is important to explore the diffusion, adoption, use, and effects of mobile TV - DMB during its early stage. The main purpose of this study is to explore how and why people adopt and use mobile TV  DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) in the context of their everyday lives, who the early adopters are, and what the effects of mobile TV are. The study aims to better understand why mobile TV is emerging and penetrating into peoples daily lives and society, what is expected from the use of mobile TV, and what the potential impacts of mobile TV  DMB are on traditional media consumption. The study also focuses on identifying the factors that customers consider important in their decision to adopt mobile TV. It explores how the use of mobile TV adapts to existing patterns of media use."
2007-0965,Modeling the Impact of the Internet on Exposure to Political Disagreement,Discussion & Disagreement,,,,Paper,Modeling the Impact of the Internet on Exposure to Political Disagreement,Discussion & Disagreement,"A substantial body of scholarship has been dedicated to modeling the impact of particular social forums and personal characteristics on the frequency with which individuals encounter disagreement during political discussion. There are at least 2 notable gaps in this literature, however. First, most of it displays an exclusive focus on traditional face-to-face forums of discussion, such as the workplace or volunteer associations, rather than online forums of discussion, such as chat rooms and website bulletin boards. Second, there is a general lack of clarity about how structural-level constraints on heterogeneity, such as those produced by geography, impact exposure to political disagreement at the individual level. This article therefore elaborates on existing theories of exposure to political disagreement by developing a more sophisticated model that encompasses the potential influences of individual level characteristics and behaviors, frequency of political discussion both online and offline, and relevant structural level constraints."

Specifically, the variables of perceived resolvability, serial argument goals, conflict tactics, rumination, and motivation to reduce ruminative thoughts are examined across romantic and family relationships. The proposed paths emerged generally as predicted and each of the models tested fit the data. Different path directions emerged according to which serial argument goal was most important and the type of conflict tactic that was used. These series of serial argument models allow for a preliminary theoretical depiction of the process of a serial argument episode enacted by close relational partners."
2007-0967,Modulating Synchronicity in Computer-Mediated Communication,vations in Communication Theory,,,,Paper,Modulating Synchronicity in Computer-Mediated Communication,Innovations in Communication Theory,"Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) researchers often cite a dichotomy that distinguishes synchronous and asynchronous media. We examine the historical development of this bifurcated classification, as well as present evidence about the manner CMC media is actually used in the field. We speculate about the evolutionary and biological basis for this behavior. We suggest that synchronicity should not be treated as a dichotomy, but rather as a continuum ranging from the highly synchronous, to the highly asynchronous. In addition, we propose that the traditional treatment of synchronicity as an attribute of the medium should be reevaluated. We should treat synchronicity as an attribute of the conversation, not of the medium. These claims have implications on theories in which medium synchronicity plays an important role, and the Media Richness Theory is examined as a test case. Moreover, given that synchronicity is a continuous parameter modulated through decisions of communicators, we examine the way these decisions on synchronicity are taken, propose a theory of synchronicity modulation, and discuss the synchronicity trade-off principle."

Data were collected from male (N = 158) and female (N = 289) college students at a large public university in Southern California. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships for males and females. Both models showed excellent fit. More specifically, sons' satisfaction with their bodies was found to be influenced by mothers' level of body satisfaction and fathers' criticism, as well as by their Body Mass Index (BMI), a health-industry standard of weight adjusted for height. Fathers' criticism emerged as the strongest predictor of body satisfaction for females, followed by BMI Fathers' criticism, furthermore, seems to have a strong impact on how much mothers criticize their daughters in regard to weight and appearance issues. Implications of the findings are discussed."

Measures to contain this phenomenon were so far rather restrictive. However, there is still a considerable number of illegal systems and users are able to decide quite freely between legal and illegal downloads because illegal downloads are still difficult to sanction. Recent economic approaches account for users´ improved bargaining position. They are based on the idea of revenue splitting between professional sellers and peers. In order to test such an innovative business model, we carried out an experiment with 100 undergraduate students forming five small peer-to-peer networks. The networks were confronted with different economic conditions. The results indicate that even experienced file sharers hold favorable attitudes towards revenue splitting. They seem to be willing to adjust their behavior to different economic conditions."

The presented approach refers to social psychological theories of moral disengagement (Bandura, 2002) and moral exclusion (Opotow, 1990) and argues that perception processes cued by the video game (e.g. acting out of good moral intentions, perpetrating against creatures instead of humans) shape virtual violent behavior as acceptable. Two 2x2-experiments with 80 subjects were conducted that applied manipulated versions of two popular ego-shooters. Moral concern, emotional distress, and enjoyment were assessed as outcomes. Results show that narrative cues like fighting for a just purpose foster moral disengagement and breed enjoyment, while display cues (e.g., human or creature-like opponents) showed no or opposite effects. The inclusion of traits and other covariates leads to multi-causal explanations.

A Content Analysis of Informal Movie Reviews Online,Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Morality and Movies: What are People Thinking? A Content Analysis of Informal Movie Reviews Online,Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,"It has long been assumed that movies can have an influence on moral development and moral thought. The content analysis presented here examines whether and how people who post informal reviews online think about moral issues related to the films, and how that fits with theories about moral development and the role of moral thoughts in entertainment. The results indicate that, in this context, conscious thoughts about moral issues are scarce, although they increase significantly when a movie is morally ambiguous. Most of the comments about moral issues reflect on the possible moral effects on others rather than on the self. This result casts some doubt on the assumption that films can be a tool for moral self-development. Other results show that moral comments about elements beyond the plot and characters (creators of the film, general audience and the world at large) are almost as frequent as those about the storyline, and that people use the level of moral complexity of a film to evaluate its overall quality. It would appear that the role of moral thoughts is more varied than previous theoretical models indicate. Future research in the area should perhaps incorporate considerations about moral ambiguity of a movie, moral thoughts beyond plot issues, and different roles that moral thoughts play in audiences interpretations of movies."

This qualitative textual analysis examines how More, a magazine targeted to women over 40, framed health, aging, and femininity. The central frame that emerged is difference: More readers were depicted as different from previous generations of older women, different from their younger counterparts, and different from men. More readers were advised that medical advancements made them the first generation that could look forward to aging as a time of personal growth, rather than a time of physical decline. However, More sent mixed messages about growing older, suggesting that aging is something to be delayed and avoided."

People seek information as far as they believe that knowing more about an issue is worthwhile. They search for different information, in different media, depending on what knowledge they desire. This paper outlines 4 kinds of information needs, which are identified from the interactions between several survey measures of information seeking behaviour. Thus, it is possible to connect peoples knowledge and knowledge goals, via distinguishable information needs, to their media preferences. Testing these relationships using survey data on European political information (Eurobarometer 52.0), the core propositions are supported. Crucially, perceived sufficiency of knowledge, compared to subjective knowledge goals, guides information demands. The amount of previous knowledge determines what kind of information is sought, which in turn relates to media preferences. With higher knowledge, people increasingly stress knowledge-acquisition over orientation, and background information over news reporting."

The within-subjects laboratory experiment was grounded in the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP). Theoretically, it advances the LC4MP by further examining the influence of motivationally relevant content on processing. Generally, the results demonstrate that positive content is associated with physiological indicators of appetitive activation  or approach. With respect to processing, coactive content was more thoroughly encoded, as indicated by subjects superior audio recognition memory for these messages. Also, greater cognitive effort resulting in slower heart rates over time was observed for messages that were coactive. Methodologically, the study demonstrated the potential suitability of a new physiological measure of appetitive activation  postauricular response (PAR). Specifically, a trend toward larger PARs was observed for more appetitive content."

A follow-up study (N=531) was conducted to examine bloggings real life consequences, measured by users perceived loneliness, belonging, and psychological well-being. The results of Study 2 confirm the usefulness of the theoretical model in Study 1. We also present evidence for perceived social support from personal blog usage.

But what makes media users more likely to select such content at some times and less likely at others? Building upon the foundation of Uses and Gratifications Theory and Terror Management Theory, I argue that a number of specific needs may drive the selection of sexual media content, including the need to quell existential anxiety. Experimental results supporting this proposition are reported."

The results of a survey of 374 Israeli undergraduate students show that empathy is an important component in identification with female characters, whereas the imagination component is important in identification with male characters, regardless of the viewer's sex. The findings are discussed in relation to the differences and the similarities between interpersonal interactions, and relations with television characters."

Most research in the field concentrates on textual elements. Particularly in emotional processing of media content, there are well-founded considerations that visuals do have essential effects. In several studies we examined the emotional processing of TV-news. Investigation was done combining on the one hand timeline data of TV-reports (describing visual/formal presentation as well as content/textual aspects of TV-reports) and on the other hand measures of facial reactions (as observable indicators of unobservable emotional processes). Results indicate that the temporal structures as well as visual and content variables of TV reports initiate emotional processes. But contrary to presumptions, if violent events are portrayed in news without visualization (text only-mode) viewers react with more negative facial expressions then to episodes where violence is shown as moving picture (visual only-mode). Surprisingly, even more facial reactions are recorded when violent acts are presented in a ""text only"" mode than in a ""text accompanied by visuals"" mode of production. In sum, our results indicate that the interplay between textual and visual aspects in moving pictures affects our emotions and by this (deeply) moves the news audience."
2007-0980,Moving Targets: Introducing Mobility Into Universal Service Obligations,"Media, Technology, and Development",,,,Paper,Moving Targets: Introducing Mobility Into Universal Service Obligations,"Media, Technology, and Development","Structural changes in the economies of developing countries are leading to increased mobility of work and family life, and so an accommodating set of universal service obligations implies new goals that extend beyond wireline telephone penetration and access. Wireless telephony penetration frequently exceeds wireline penetration in developing countries, and digital wireless platforms can incorporate Internet technology. This paper evaluates the history of telecom development in Mexico that has led to wireless telephony becoming the new consumption norm. The study takes the e-Mexico project as a case study of diversified Universal Service obligations beyond wireline telephony. It considers potential obstacles to incorporating mobile phone and Internet (Wireless Web) services into Mexicos diversified universal service policy, including economic barriers to political mobilization over issues of telecom policy."
2007-0981,Moving Towards a Creative Society,Theme Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Moving Towards a Creative Society,Theme Interactive Paper Session,"The Chinese government proposed to upgrade its manufacturing-driven economy to a creative and innovation-base economy by developing cultural industry. The essence of the cultural industry reforms is to open up Chinas cultural market and facilitate the development of a cultural economy, with the governments tight grip of content remains. But the reforms allow content providers a more relaxed environment to produce creative content. With the growing power of the audience and the speedy technological development in media, the relations between content providers and the government have turned a new page. The balance is being tipped in favor of the content providers, with the aid of the collective power of the audience. Although the top-down party controlled model of state-run media stays unchanged, commercial interests and audience demands are the driving forces to push for a more diverse and creative Chinese society. In this paper, I propose to examine the factors affecting the content-generating process in China. I will use Super Girl, the Chinese edition of English reality show Pop Idol, as an example to explain the fundamental problems of the reform, and the role the audience plays in the battleground where commercial interests are trying to fight against the government."

Eight in-house public relations practitioners of multinationals in Beijing and Shanghai were interviewed. The findings indicate that (1) Different perceptions on public relations exist in China. (2) The possible factors that influence multinationals public relations practice include organizational culture, type, and size; competitors public relations efforts; foreign relations; government relations; socialistic market economy; consumerism; guanxi; and Chinese media. (3) Relationship building, pre-planning, active communication, and selective use of media can probably lead to better public relations practice in China. (4) The present study identifies 4 developmental trends of public relations: (a) a close linkage between socialistic market economy and public relations, (b) a rise of strategic public relations, (c) a cooperative relationship between media and public relations, and (d) a partnership between in-house public relation and agencies."

As an elaboration and further development of that perspective, it argues that daily conversations provide the symbolic forums where multiple cultural ideologies are heard, debated, and negotiated. It also argues that culture is multivocal in that it is a unity of different and many times contradictory voices, which are played out in everyday talk. One daily conversation is analyzed that bears out these arguments. Implications of the study for research and theory on culture and communication are also discussed."

Studies also show that youth spend a significant amount of time with these media. Furthermore, listening to music lyrics and viewing music videos has been linked to a number of sexual beliefs and behaviors, such as early initiation of sexual activity. From a content analytic perspective, the advantages and disadvantages of analyzing lyrics with and without video have not been explored. This paper hypothesizes that music videos have more sexual content than music lyrics due to their visual nature. Specifically, it was hypothesized that compared to music lyrics music videos will have more portrayals of intimate touching, sexually suggestive appearance, passionate kissing, and nudity. The results from a content analysis of 50 music videos and 50 songs with lyrics support these hypotheses with one exception; there are no differences with respect to the portrayal of nudity. The implications of these findings for content analysis sampling are discussed."
2007-0988,Muslim Identity in the British Press: A Comparison of the Rushdie Affair and Cartoon Controversies,Media Depictions and Identity,,,,Paper,Muslim Identity in the British Press: A Comparison of the Rushdie Affair and Cartoon Controversies,Media Depictions and Identity,"Tensions between the western and Muslim worlds surfaced yet again with a recent controversy over the European press publication of provocative editorial cartoons about Islam and Prophet Mohammed. The rage expressed by Muslims and the wests subsequent defence of secularity and freedom of expression is reminiscent of a similar conflict almost 20 years ago, concerning Satanic Versus, a fictional novel authored by Salman Rushdie. Both incidents constitute a tension between freedom of expression and religious (or cultural) tolerance; the wests dismissal of these incidents as inevitable conflicts between liberalism and religious conservatism, repeatedly evokes Huntingons clash of civilisations argument. This study attempts to trace the wests understanding of the Muslim world over the last 2 decades by comparing the media coverage of the Rushdie affair with the cartoon controversy. Drawing upon orientalism and the clash of civilisations argument this study examines media texts and discourse to ask how Muslim identity is constructed during both these incidents; and how media coverage reflects the tension between freedom of expression and religious tolerance. Furthermore this study is interested in examining whether the clash of civilisations and orientalism are only stages in an attempt to truly build dialog with the Muslim world, or if they are a means of widening this existing divide."
2007-0989,Muslim Religious Lifestyle Branding in the U.S.,Branding Experience: Explorations in the Marketization of Cultures and Identities,,,,Paper,Muslim Religious Lifestyle Branding in the U.S.,Branding Experience: Explorations in the Marketization of Cultures and Identities,"This paper examines the rise and popularity of Muslim popular music groups that aim to reinforce a positive U.S. Muslim identity for young people. Like the heavily commercialized U.S. Christian lifestyles industry that has pumped out age-specific Bibles, pop music, t-shirts, and bric-a-brac for more than a century, popular Muslim music groups borrow commercial forms for identity work. Employing the concept of religious lifestyle branding (Clark, 2007), this paper builds upon earlier research to explore some unintended consequences of these efforts of identity-reinforcement. It demonstrates that by participating in the process of marketization, well-meaning groups have had to contend with having their efforts marshaled for the branding efforts of others: in this case, those of the Bush administration.

It will be argued that these works (which are rarely, if ever, read in conjunction) elicit underlying themes of one another, including similarities found both in their subjects and their reception. It will be shown that James Joyce is central to this connection. The writing of nonbooks by Derrida and McLuhan, it will be argued, deconstruct communication form in a manner similar to Joyce, highlighting and applying to Derrida and McLuhan what Samuel Beckett once said of Joyce: His writing is not about something; it is that something itself."

Using MySpace, SMS, and IM, they rallied their peers. Although larger protests had occurred earlier, these teens wanted their voices to be uniquely heard. In September 2006, 700,000 + youth joined a Facebook group to protest a new feature. By vocalizing their dissent in this medium, they forced the company to make changes.

These events showcase the ways that youth are leveraging social media to build networks and magnify their voice. Both examples highlight how youth engage politically in publics that matter to them and to which they have access. Using social network tools, they leverage connections to spread messages virally, creating solidarity through friends and friends-of-friends. In this paper, I analyze different political practices by youth using social network sites. I also discuss how adults' failure to recognize such political acts discourages young people's engagement.

2007-0992,Naive Media Schema or Perceived Personal Differences: An Experiment on Media Framing and Third-Person Perceptions,The Third-Person Effect and Behavior: Research and Reviews,,,,Paper,Naive Media Schema or Perceived Personal Differences: An Experiment on Media Framing and Third-Person Perceptions,The Third-Person Effect and Behavior: Research and Reviews,"Using an experimental design embedded within a web-based survey, this study tests the effects of differential framing (gains versus loss) on expectations of policy support and individual behavioral outcomes both for self and others, in the context of an antipoverty campaign. Our results support an expected reverse third-person perception for desirable messages. Across conditions subjects reported that exposure to a PSA on poverty they would be more likely than others to support public policy on poverty and engage in behaviors that address the issue of poverty, such as donating money to anti-poverty campaigns. Results suggest that a naive magic-bullet theory for assessing media effects on others seems implausible as the underlying mechanism for third-person effects. If mere exposure was enough to elicit effects on others we should have found that others were more affected than the self. However, this was not the case. Furthermore, a logical elaboration of this theory would suggest that certain frames would be particularly deleterious for others, relative to self. However, this was not the case in this data. If anything media frames affected the perceptions of self future policy support, but did not affect the perception of how much others would support the policy or how they would behave. Implications of these findings are discussed as well as suggestions for future research."

The results show that in the immediate aftermath of the London bombings, most of the newspapers reported by speculating about the attack using largely ambiguous quotes to report on the suspects: specifically al-Qaeda. British intelligence officials later admit that the suspects are homegrown. The phenomenon of media priming is thus proven among the journalists when they reported the attacks as breaking news. This study should shed light on how journalists make decisions when covering events where full information is not immediately available. Further, this study discusses the political and cultural differences that can attribute to the differences in coverage between the 4 countries, and offers ideas of journalism education that may help to better prepare journalists for covering such traumatic events."
2007-0994,"Narrating the 1960s via ""The '60s"": Television's Representation of the Past Between History and Memory",Constructing and Reconstructing the '60s,,,,Paper,"Narrating the 1960s via ""The '60s"": Television's Representation of the Past Between History and Memory",Constructing and Reconstructing the '60s,"This paper aims to position the question of how television narrates the past within the context of the debate over the differences, or rather overlaps between history and memory. The approach to this task unfolds via two complementing trajectories. The first, discusses several fundamental approaches towards the study of the interrelations between history and memory while focusing on Pierre Nora's concept of the ""realms of memory."" The paper argues that the much-noted effectiveness of televised representations of the past evolves from their use of storytelling strategies that bestow upon such productions the qualities of both memory and history.
The second trajectory explores the realm of memory concept through its implementation in one paradigmatic example: the miniseries The '60s, which was aired on NBC in 1999. The paper contends that The '60s - and by extension, other historical television movies - are created and consumed as constructed realms of memory that are shaped and amplified by the conventions of popular culture. Consequently, the paper probes the ways by which The '60s shaped a narrative that is both authoritative and emotionally potent via some of the fundamental concepts offered by Hayden White in his analysis of historical accounts: the construction of The '60s' narrative through a process of selection and omission; the means through which the storytellers of the narrative established their own authority; and the morals or messages that emerge from the narrative."
2007-0995,Narrative and Ethnography as Existential Phenomenological Approaches to Organizational Sensemaking,Discourse and Organizational Narratives,,,,Work in Progress,Narrative and Ethnography as Existential Phenomenological Approaches to Organizational Sensemaking,Discourse and Organizational Narratives,"Researchers across disciplinary boundaries find Weicks concept of sensemaking fundamentally important for understanding both individual and organizational activity. Sensemaking is the process by which message equivocality is reduced temporally through the communicative accomplishment of the double-interact. Unfortunately the methods of investigation into sensemaking activity often represent these processes as static, rather than as fluid. I analyze sensemaking through the lens of existential phenomenology, a philosophical basis which recognizes the individual as embedded in everyday activity. As such, sensemaking needs to be examined methodologically through narrative and auto/ethnographic research, which improve existential understandings of individual and organizational processes temporally."

The first 3 hypotheses predicted that viewers with lower cognitive ability, lower need for cognition, and less experience with challenging films would understand a film of lower cognitive challenge more than they would a film of greater cognitive challenge. The second 3 hypotheses predicted that viewers of higher cognitive ability, higher need for cognition, and greater experience with challenging films would enjoy a film of greater cognitive challenge more than they would a film of lesser cognitive challenge; and that viewers with lower cognitive ability, lower need for cognition, and less experience with challenging films would enjoy a film of lower cognitive challenge more than a film of greater cognitive challenge. The feature film Memento was reedited to produce 3 experimental treatment versions with varying levels of cognitive challenge. In a 2 x 4 experimental design, these 3 versions plus the original were shown to 4 experimental groups of undergraduates. A treatment check showed that the groups who saw the versions with the most and least predicted cognitive challenge experienced significantly different levels of cognitive challenge as measured by a 3-item ad hoc scale. Analysis of variance showed no main effects of treatment group on comprehension or enjoyment. Analysis of variance also showed no interaction effects between cognitive ability, need for cognition, or experience with challenging films. A stepwise regression showed that only liking for the protagonist was a significant predictor of enjoyment. This suggests that feelings for the characters may outweigh narrative comprehension in producing viewer enjoyment."
2007-0997,Narrative Story Structures and Personalization: Approaches to Television News Storytelling,formation Systems: Tell Me a Story...Processing of Narrative in Media Content,,,,Paper,Narrative Story Structures and Personalization: Approaches to Television News Storytelling,Information Systems: Tell Me a Story...Processing of Narrative in Media Content,"Although people claim to receive most of their information on current events from television, past research has shown that recall of this information is poor. This study investigated the effects of writing a news story in chronological order, as opposed to standard broadcast structure which presents information in order of importance. This study also looked at personalizationfocusing the events of the story on how one particular individual experienced these events. Using the event-indexing model of literary comprehension, it was posited that stories written in chronological order and have a personal angle will improve memory for information in news stories. The results showed statistical significance in the opposite direction than predicted. Stories written in broadcast structurewriting the main point of the story first then developing the story out of chronological orderproduced better memory for information than stories written in the chronological narrative. Additionally, recall for stories without a personal angle was better than recall for stories with this element of personalization. Because the event-indexing model has mostly been tested on literary texts, future research on the event-indexing model should investigate different indices or defaults for news texts. Past research has indicated that literary texts and expository texts are processed differently, although this research has not found a theoretical explanation for these differences. Using theories of mental models, it is important to investigate these differences in order to better understand how individuals learn about the world."

The research identifies commonalities and differences across the three case studies with respect to ideological discourse and associated identity work. More specifically, the study elucidates how different groups employ transnational and national identities to define 9/11s victims and perpetrators. One ideological faction uses American national identity as a tool to blame the United States for 9/11 and to exclude Americans from spheres of moral concern. In response, opposing ideological camps discount national identity as a salient identity marker and employ transnational identity frames to define 9/11s victims. The ways in which such identities are processed by members of these different national groups are examined with an eye to understanding the perspectives of individuals on the periphery and at the core of the world system. In identifying these trends, the work sheds new light on older questions addressing ideological conflict surrounding nationalism and transnationalism. In so doing, the study enriches our knowledge of online discourses regarding national and transnational identities as meaning-making tools."

Scholarship in the field of communication often presupposes that same-sex and mixed group interaction are scripted according to monolithic Western notions of gendered communication. This study discusses the implications of this assertion whereby men and women in various cultures, especially non-Western cultures refute the legitimacy of monolithic gender roles in dialogic communication. Communicative behaviors underlying gender appropriation derived from culture is fluid, and current theorizing about gendered communication is limited. These limitations are not conducive to complex social realities where issues of status confound intracultural communication and intercultural communication. An ontological, epistemological and methodological approach is asserted that seeks to clarify nuances that exist within and across cultures in gendered communication."

While the US government pushes for a further liberalization of audio-visual services under the umbrella of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), other countries are more reserved. They see the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a threat to their media culture. Public service broadcasting, quotas for local content and support programs for the audio-visual industry are claimed to be at stake. This paper first distinguishes three phases of global media governance and argues that the current phase, characterized by a strong influence of the WTO, puts strong pressure on societal regulation of broadcasting. Second, the status quo of this regulation aimed at fostering social, cultural and political ends is touched upon. Next, the agreements administered by the WTO and their current influence on media regulation are dealt with before focusing on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The latter experiences a comeback in global media governance and is expected to deliver an alternative perspective on the media. Fifth, this paper is addressing the future development of global media governance and its potential effects on broadcasting regulation. It will be concluded that the impact of the GATS for the media might be far-reaching: Liberalizing audio-visual services would prevent several measures of broadcasting regulation. Additionally, the UNESCOs efforts to promote and protect cultural diversity probably cannot stop this development."

This paper examines social movement Internet use by surveying how national social movement organizations utilize this communication resource at one of its most visible points of access, the World Wide Web. Drawing on alternative media studies, the paper develops a typology that identifies the communication functions most central to social movements and surveys the Web sites of social movement organizations (SMOs) to determine the degree to which their Web-based activities and attributes perform these functions. The survey results suggest that the majority of national SMOs are not utilizing the Web to its full potential and posits a number of reasons why this might be the case, including organizational objectives, organizational resources, and the structure of the larger Web-based networks of which SMOs are a part."
2007-1002,Nations as Brands: Examples from Postcommunist Europe,Branding Experience: Explorations in the Marketization of Cultures and Identities,,,,Paper,Nations as Brands: Examples from Postcommunist Europe,Branding Experience: Explorations in the Marketization of Cultures and Identities,"More than 15 years after the 1989 velvet revolutions, former communist countries continue to suffer from national identity crises brought about by volatile internal politics, uneven economic reforms, and crumbling collective values. This condition is further complicated by transnational economic and geo-political realignments. In response, many postcommunist nations have employed international brand consultants to advise them on how to re-invent their national images. The rapid adoption of the nation branding discourse raises questions about the impact of market ideologies on the meaning of nationhood in postcommunist Europe. This paper problematizes the equivalence of nation and brand that is implied by the nation branding proposition and examines its theoretical and social implications. Using examples from the nation branding efforts of several postcommunist countries, the analysis examines the ways in which nation branding rearticulates or reinscribes local and global relations of social power after the end of the Cold War."
2007-1003,"Necessary Knowledge for Communications Policy: Information Asymmetries and Commercial Data Access and Usage in the Policymaking Process, TOP THREE PAPER","Chronicling the Past: Memory, Maps, Marconi, and Money",,,,Paper,"Necessary Knowledge for Communications Policy: Information Asymmetries and Commercial Data Access and Usage in the Policymaking Process, TOP THREE PAPER","Chronicling the Past: Memory, Maps, Marconi, and Money","Communications policymaking increasingly relies upon large-scale databases manufactured and marketed by commercial organizations. These data providers supplement the limited data gathering capacity of government bodies and thereby bring a greater quantity of relevant data to bear on policy issues than would otherwise be possible. These data are utilized extensively by stakeholders with an interest in policy outcomes to conduct and submit studies that policymakers rely upon in their deliberations.

One byproduct of this situation is that, to the increasing extent that the data relied upon in policymaking, policy analysis, and policy advocacy are provided by commercial organizations, substantial inequalities in access to these data arise. Specifically, certain actors in the policymaking process, such as academic researchers and public interest organizations, lack the resources of communications firms and industry associations to access the data that are vital to conducting thorough, reliable, and persuasive policy research. Policymakers themselves often find their research objectives inhibited by the enormous expense associated with relevant large-scale commercial datasets, and thus find themselves increasingly reliant upon the analyses conducted by those stakeholder groups with the resources necessary to gain access to such data. As a result of these information asymmetries, policy decision-making is likely to suffer, as the research inputs inevitably fail to reflect the full range of considerations across the full range of interested stakeholders. This paper illustrates these issues via a case study of the FCCs 2003 media ownership proceeding and offers suggestions for how existing disparities in access to policy-relevant data might be addressed."

In order to examine needs, and motivations concerning such sites, a uses and gratifications framework is implemented. The purpose of this study is to understand how and why people make use of CMC via online networking sites. Twenty-five social networking website users were interviewed in order to examine participants needs, and motications. Motivations include entertainment, information, and social utility. Needs are broken down into categories including cognitive, affective, personal, social, and escapist. These needs and motivations are revealed through user behavior, which concentrated on messaging, comments, pictures, friend networks, personal profiles, and others profiles. Part of the appeal of social networking sites is the ability of the software to meet multiple needs on multiple levels. This ability brings back users for repeat participation and explains the stickiness of the software."

The intervention was designed for young men who have sex with men (MSM) and takes a socially optimized learning approach, using a virtual social environment to simulate the interpersonal, emotional, and contextual cues of a sexual scenario. Higher levels of intervention-induced negative affect (particularly fear) were associated with a greater reduction in subsequent risk-taking for MSM who were exposed to an interactive version of the intervention in which they actively made decisions in the context of risk. No such associations were evident for men who passively viewed a noninteractive version. Moreover, the association was restricted to younger MSM, suggesting that developmental factors play a critical role in the interventions ability to link affect with subsequent behavior. Unlike traditional approaches, our intervention may result in the automatic encoding of affective cautionary signals."

Discourses are taken from 2 publications of transcripts containing reminiscences and lessons learned, produced to share with wider audiences in Northern Ireland. A variety of differences in intersecting group identities are negotiated by speakers including membership in the intercommunity group, community based identifications, generation, gender, political position, and religion. These multiple identifications are negotiated as speakers coconstruct their varied relationships with members of their own communities, with members of the intercommunity group, and relate and respond to contextual factors including histories, institutions such as housing authorities, developers, security forces, and the church. Implications of this framework for conflict researchers and practitioners are addressed."

This article focuses on the much disputed story of the capture and rescue of Pfc. Jessica Lynch in Iraq, and examines the ways in which the New York Times negotiated its authority vis-à-vis other cultural texts that lay claim to the story, particularly NBCs made-for-television movie Saving Jessica Lynch, and the biographical novel, I am a Soldier, Too. The analysis suggests that the Times dialectically oscillated between treating other cultural players as the others of journalism and as legitimate participants in a shared project of cultural production; between constructing itself as a participant in the contest over the real story and an observer of this contest; and between offering drafts and final records of the story. At a broader level, the article demonstrates the need to see the elite press as neither the other of popular culture nor its equal counterpart, and argues for a possible analogy between the ostensibly contradictory epistemologies of cultural studies and journalism."

The hidden meaning structure of the Zainichi Korean discourses, as well as those presented by their dominant counterparts, is reconstructed from historical-political perspectives. The undergirding themes of the discourses and specific languages used by the participants to frame their social realities were explored from the two Japanese authors standpoint. Two overarching themes concerning the past and the future of Zainichi Koreans emerged from the analysis: the historical interpretation of Japans colonization of Korea and the future of Zainichi Koreans in the Japanese society. The analysis revealed that Zainichi Koreans and Japanese endorse different realities and negotiate them through selectively crafted languages. Historically and politically contingent nature of Zainichi Korean discourses is discussed and the difficulty of maintaining dialogue between the dominant/privileged and the marginalized/underprivileged is also pointed out."

Instead of men facing crisis because of feminism and womens expanded access to public spaces and professional lifeas common throughout the 1980soriginal cable dramas debuting in the early 2000s such as The Sopranos, The Shield, Playmakers, Nip/Tuck, and Rescue Me introduced a set of male television characters, a particular narrative form, and a distinctive discourse about the experience of male crisis that was different from their predecessors and repeated in a manner that suggested a significant cultural resonance. Some of the distinction of these shows can be traced to their institutional status as original cable series and the particular environment of industry competition of the era, but these shows also indicate much about social anxieties regarding gender roles and the status of feminism in an era of storytelling that comes after the backlash, and as such, present a crucial site for feminist television criticism. This paper examines the stories about men and their crises offered by these series and how they suggest the decreasing relevance of hegemonic masculinity as critical category previously common in examinations of men and masculinity on television. The paper particularly explores FX series The Shield and Rescue Me."
2007-1010,Neo-Liberalism and Media Policy: The Problem of the Public,terrogating Media Neo-Liberalisms,,,,Paper,Neo-Liberalism and Media Policy: The Problem of the Public,Interrogating Media Neo-Liberalisms,"This paper examines the extent to which neo-liberalism is an appropriate and meaningful lens through to which to make sense of contemporary media policies that govern both market and non-market institutions. Neo-liberalisms emphasis on the market as a key mechanism through which to secure individual freedom and encourage personal responsibility has led to a re-conceptualization of the role of the public as subject and object of contemporary media policy. Based on an a series of interviews with leading policymakers in the US and the UK and an analysis of recent policy debates in those two states, the paper aims to articulate the place of the public in the development and implementation of media policy ideas. In doing so, it attempts to highlight some of the tensions and contradictions between the theory of neo-liberalism and the material practices carried out in its name."
2007-1011,Neoliberal Models of Race on Americas Next Top Model,Reading Race and Racial Identity Through Global and Local Cultural Markers,,,,Paper,Neoliberal Models of Race on Americas Next Top Model,Reading Race and Racial Identity Through Global and Local Cultural Markers,"While some studies of television content have found an increase in the number of women and people of color represented over time and on certain networks, those representations must be thoroughly analyzed and scrutinized. In my close textual analysis of season six of Americas Next Top Model, I found that superficial racial diversity offers the illusion that racial inequalities have already been resolved and advances a dangerous depoliticization of race.

The ways in which the shows judges devalue one African American contestants Southern accent, which they insist is inappropriate and unmarketable, is indicative of the shows overall commitment to producing models who display and uphold normative upper class whiteness. On ANTM, racial issues only appear as entertaining interpersonal conflict and the show further offers a white hegemonic colorblind position by labeling the beauty of the white models all-American and representing the racial identity of models of color as a source of exotic beauty and as a highly marketable trait.

The erasure of the politics of race and its relegation to the domain of interpersonal drama on the show is also tied to a project of normalizing and legitimating neoliberalism through cultural tropes and narratives. Successful ANTM contestants are ideal neoliberal citizens: they prove the facility of overcoming class and race disadvantages; they take responsibility for themselves; and they work hard and happily endure hardship."
2007-1012,Neos Liberal Movement: The Action Film as a Handmaiden to Globalism,dentity Spaces in Communicative Spheres,,,,Paper,Neos Liberal Movement: The Action Film as a Handmaiden to Globalism,Identity Spaces in Communicative Spheres,"This paper argues that one of the characteristics of globally marketed action film in recent years is a distinctly new aesthetics of movement. It draws on Deleuzes semiotics of cinema, which treats the significance of the movement-image and action-image, to argue that this new movement has profound ideological implications because it disseminates a fantasy of free and unregulated movement that is commensurate with neo-liberal political discourse. This movement is overtly virtual, using hidden-wire sequences and CGI post-production that allow characters to move in ways that defy natural and national laws. Not only has this movement become a ubiquitous part of the action film, but has begun to work its way into all forms of mass media. The paper analyzes this movement in relation to the Charlies Angels and The Matrix franchises, showing how action, by way of revealing the underlying forces which control the relation of objects within cinematic space, is similar to the way in which ideology works as the unconscious regime which enables a subject to act within social space. Further, it argues that these films have come to render this movement invisible or normal, thereby supporting the fantasy of free movement that global empire depends upon. It shows how the fantasy of deregulated movement in action films and in neo-liberal discourse on globalization both conceal the importance of capital as a precondition. Finally, it argues that the films end up serving existing power structures by virtue of making the heroic individual the only way towards transcendence."
2007-1013,"Networked Mobility in Urban China: Hukou, Working-Class ICTs, and the Case of Sun Zhigang",Freedom and Control on the Internet of East Asia,,,,Paper,"Networked Mobility in Urban China: Hukou, Working-Class ICTs, and the Case of Sun Zhigang",Freedom and Control on the Internet of East Asia,"How do migrants in urban China build networks, using traditional means and working-class ICTs (information and communication technologies)? What contribute to their potentials for transformation and their pitfalls of alienation in urban places? We propose the concept of networked mobility to explore these questions. First, the corrosion of hukou household registration system provides the institutional pre-condition for self-organization among migrants. Second, the spread of working-class ICTs such as cybercafé and inexpensive mobile phones offers a new material basis for migrants to strengthen and extend social networks. The conjuncture of these two processes gives rise to patterns of networked mobility, through which information-based migration and place-based networking emerge beyond their traditional scale, scope, and speed. The process may empower migrants or reproduce hukou-based inequality. We draw from existing evidence and the case of Sun Zhigang to examine networked mobility, its role in community building among migrants, and its life and death consequences. In so doing, we attempt to bring coherence to two sets of critical phenomena  one institutional, the other technological  which are often treated in isolation. The article ends by discussing the implications of networked mobility for understanding socio-spatial dynamics among migrants in urban China and for future research."
2007-1014,Network Evolution in Organizational Communities,Networks and Typologies,,,,Paper,Network Evolution in Organizational Communities,Networks and Typologies,"Organizational communities are typically defined as populations of organizations that that are tied together by networks of relations in overlapping resource niches. Traditionally, evolutionary theorists and researchers have examined organizational populations that comprise organizational communities focusing on their properties rather than the networks that link them. However, a full understanding of the evolution of organizational communities requires insight into both organizations and their networks. Consequently, this paper presents initial efforts to apply evolutionary theory to organizational and community networks. It focuses on evolutionary principles, including variation, selection, and retention, that lead to the formation, growth, maintenance, and eventual demise of network linkages. This perspective allows us to see that community survival and success are as dependent on their organizational linkages as they are on the organizations they connect."

Incumbent telecommunications companies, which control the major Internet transmission backbones, want an unfettered option of diversifying Internet services even at the risk of balkanizing and tiering service. Advocates for network neutrality have grave concerns that such flexibility will provider carriers the ability to extort additional compensation and to engage in anticompetitive tactics.

This paper will consider the lawfulness of telephone company management strategies to tier, brand and diversify the Internet, including the elimination of a one size fits all best efforts routing system. Differential pricing based on quality of service and other factors makes sense to Bellhead corporate officers who hope to capture rents that otherwise would accrue to content providers. On the other hand Nethead strategies for promoting best efforts Internet routing has achieved widespread access and has contributed to successful adoption of this new social and commercial medium.

The article also will examine the clash of Bellhead and Nethead cultures with an eye toward identifying the stakes involved when Internet access pricing and interconnection primarily follows a telecommunications infrastructure cost recovery scheme in lieu of different commercial relationships favored by most Internet ventures. The paper identifies both lawful and unlawful discrimination. It concludes that most Bellhead cost recovery models are lawful even though they will reduce for most consumers the real or perceived value proposition offered by an unmetered monthly Internet access subscription."
2007-1017,"New Asian Cultural Proximity, Korean Modernity in Between, and Reception of Korean TV Drama in the East Asia",Eclectic Topics in Intercultural Communication,,,,Paper,"New Asian Cultural Proximity, Korean Modernity in Between, and Reception of Korean TV Drama in the East Asia",Eclectic Topics in Intercultural Communication,"Popularity of Korean pop culture in East Asia since late 1990s is a theoretical anomaly both from the cultural imperialism and cultural proximity thesis. This study suggests that structural transformation in the East Asia has bred newly emerging sense of cultural proximity in the form of Asian modernity. For Koreas intermediate location in regional economic and cultural system, its popular culture has a larger shared area of experience people from different countries in the regions can identify with. Through the text analysis of selective Korean TV dramas and news coverage of the rise of Korean popular culture, this study suggests Korean dramas are differently received by the three counties, Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam, depending on their structural location in the globalization and industrialization process in the region. Thus the audience identify with different sense of Asian modernity presented in Korean TV dramas which is retrospective (Japan), prospective (Vietnam), and contemporaneous (Taiwan) respectively."

If referring to non-profit TSMOs only, it is suggested to use the acronym SMINGO (social movement international non-governmental organization) instead, to allow for the possibility that state and corporate agents become active participants in TSMOs. Six questions that might be of particular importance for researchers are discussed: (1) What are TSMO networks? (2) What are the characteristics and long-term outcomes of innovative SMINGO alliances? (3) How do the collective action frames of SMINGOs change over time? (4) How do SMINGOs negotiate the local and the global? (5) How do SMINGOs use new communication technologies for mobilization? (6) What role does frame alignment play in TSMO networks? As a demonstration of how one could begin to answer the sixth question, a network study is proposed that employs a mixed-method approach to the study of frame alignment in the U.S. response to sex trafficking. Seven hypotheses are presented that explore the relationship between collective action frames and emerging network structures."
2007-1019,New Directions: Girl-Centered Communication Studies for the 21st Century,Reflecting on Girls' Studies: Current Trends and Future Directions,,,,Paper,New Directions: Girl-Centered Communication Studies for the 21st Century,Reflecting on Girls' Studies: Current Trends and Future Directions,"This presentation will facilitate discussion on new directions for girl-centered communication studies by drawing attention to trends in contemporary girls media culture. Much girl-centered media scholarship to date has focused on Western girls engagements with female-oriented commercial media texts, particularly magazines. Yet, a considerable number of contemporary girls in developed countries, especially middle-class, urban dwellers, are actively involved in media-based practices from which members of their sex have long been excluded. For example, many girls are engaged in media production, creating zines, films, and websites that are consumed far beyond their local communities. In turn, a significant number of girls are active email, instant message, and cell phone communicators. Readily adapting old communication practices, while also creating new ones, via the newest trends in technology, these girls are constructing a media culture that is significantly different from those of previous generations, and thus deserves greater attention from communication scholars.

Mary Celeste Kearney is Assistant Professor of Radio-Television-Film at the University of Texas at Austin. Her research to date has focused on girls media production, girls culture, and girls representations in U.S. film and television. Her first monograph, Girls Make Media, was published recently by Routledge. She is currently working on several other projects related to girls media culture, including an industrial analysis of the development of teen-girl media, Making Their Debut: Teenage Girls and the Teen-Girl Entertainment Market, 1938-1966. She is also founding director of Cinemakids, a program for inspiring young filmmakers."

The lack of traditional forms of mass political activity and the weakness of stable democratic myths rooted in the past as well as the modern ways of political communication constitute the preconditions for successful functioning of this system. It is based on the principal of simulation of democratic politics and includes executives control over the most influential mass-media (first and foremost TV channels) and political parties and civil organizations deliberately creating for this purpose by professional salaried political consultants.

Analyses compared proportions of mentions of cancer sites with proportional contribution to cancer incidence and mortality based on available epidemiological estimates. Analyses also examined relative attention provided to prevention, detection, treatment, causes and outcomes of various cancers. Results indicated that coverage reflected incidence rates more closely than they did mortality rates, but in both cases coverage underrepresented the contribution of lung cancer to morbidity and mortality and overrepresented the contribution of breast cancer. Of greater public health concern was the limited coverage of prevention and detection even for highly preventable or relatively easily detected cancers. Implications of findings are discussed."

This study attempts reports how cancer risks are communicated in mainstream and ethnic/minority newspapers. Our data comes from a large scale content analysis of cancer news coverage from 2003 [N = 5327 stories in major newspapers (MAJN) and 565 stories in ethnic/minority newspapers (EMN)] Approximately 40% of mainstream and 52% of ethnic/minority newspapers provided numeric presentations of cancer morbidity risks. Across both newspaper sets, when numeric formats were utilized to describe cancer risks, only 19% of stories contextualized the magnitude of risk by presenting both absolute and relative risk in the same article. Across both news sources, lifestyle and demographic risks were the risk types most often mentioned in cancer news stories. Specifically, age, tobacco, race/ethnicity, and diet (as well as genetics) were the most frequently discussed cancer morbidity risks. When specific risks were discussed, risk communication most often took the form of explicit verbal descriptions, rather than a reliance on numeric formats or implicit links between cancer and the risk factor. Approximately 75% of stories discussing cancer morbidity risks contained some type of efficacy information."

entertainment: singers, television programs, stars, sports, and/or movies, for instance. But what of news junkies and those whose modes of engagement with the news are as fannish as a Buffy fan? What are we to make of those who fawn over a specific newscaster, or who spend hours upon hours each week watching, reading, and writing about the news? How might they too be fans, and what are the implications of calling them fans? This paper seeks to answer such questions by studying online news fan talk. However, and far from merely chastising citizens for fannish involvement with the news, drawing from theories of the sentimental citizen (Marcus), I will examine ways in which fandom may energize consumption of the news and of politics,and ways in which the news might learn from fandom."
2007-1026,News Media and Peace Building in Asymmetrical Conflicts: The Flow of News Between Jordan and Israel,War & Peace,,,,Paper,News Media and Peace Building in Asymmetrical Conflicts: The Flow of News Between Jordan and Israel,War & Peace,"This study explores the role of the news media in asymmetrical conflict after countries have signed a peace agreement. While most research has focused on the inherently negative role the press plays in attempts to bring peace, this study attempts to look at this issue using a more dynamic perspective. The theoretical argument focuses on how political factors affect the quantity and quality of the news flow and some of the way in which leaders can sometimes overcome the obstacles they face in promoting encouraging news about peace. The model considers 2 political factors that have a major impact on media performance: the relative level of political power of the 2 sides and the varying amount of hostility. To illustrate the importance of these factors we focus on the flow of news between Jordan and Israel between 1999 and 2002. The major findings from content analyses of news articles (N=859) appearing in both countries show that while Jordanians are exposed to massive amounts of mostly negative information about Israel, the Israeli public reads almost nothing about Jordan. Despite all this, it was also found that the initiation of diplomatic relations between the former enemies allowed for the creation of important ""news slots"" that were previously unavailable. This development created space for less threatening types of news and also allowed leaders from both Jordan and Israel to initiate some positive stories about peace, even during some of the darkest periods."

Participants were 2194 adolescent boys and girls who completed a questionnaire on television viewing, risk perception and the intention to speed and drive after consuming alcohol. As hypothesized, more news viewing was associated with a higher perceived risk of drunk driving and speeding. More music video viewing, on the other hand, was negatively associated with the assessment of the dangers of speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol. Contrary to our hypotheses, action movie viewing did not make a significant contribution to our models. Both news and music video viewing were indirectly, via risk perception, related to the intention to drive risky. The more dangerous a particular behavior was perceived to be, the less likely respondents intended to exhibit this behavior in the future."

Stratified media outlets across the country were used to obtain a representative sample of daily newspapers based on their designated market areas, resulting in 395 IPV-related articles. Results show that newspaper framing of IPV tends to be heavily skewed toward episodic framing, and that there are significant differences between content analysis data and epidemiological estimates, particularly in the area of homicide coverage and substance use, which may skew public perceptions of risk. Implications for public perceptions and social policy are discussed."

The analyses, based on a two-week constructed random sample of television programming in 2003 for 226 randomly selected, plus 27 cross-owned television stations, show that cross-owned stations did not broadcast more local news than non-cross owned stations that also provided local news. In addition, cross-ownership had no significant relationship with either the presence or the quantity of local public affairs programming on commercial television."

This study partially proves that generic frames are detectable not only in cross-sectional news coverage, but also in a single television shows over a period of time, which confirms the universal existence of certain news frames. This study also suggests that all of these generic frames are not necessarily detectable simultaneously. They do not distribute evenly either, even in an individual television show. Their visibility varied significantly not only across time, but also across topics. The discussion in this study on the relationship between the visibility of dominant news frames and the extramedia influences in China creatively shed light on the extent to which investigative journalism is able to mirror the ongoing social change in China, which is assumed helpful to better understanding the journalistic practice against the unique Chinese media ecology under a continuous change."

Implication for Communication and Coordination in Cross-Cultural Virtual Teams,The Practice of Virtual Teams,"Open channels of communication have been deemed a prerequisite for fostering a healthy organizational culture, especially in todays turbulent marketplace, where shifting alliances and shrinking product/service life cycles have necessitated tight coordination and quick responses from geographically dispersed collaborative teams. Such teams enable the integration and standardization of an organizations global strategies and resources, while providing effective client interface and local responsiveness where necessary. We use the term virtual team to describe the range of work mode in which a group of individuals of a single or multiple organization/s uses ICTs to accomplish common tasks and objectives. This paper will focus on virtual teams and on the significant factors that impact the communication and coordination of these distributed work groups that operate largely through electronically mediated means. The paper will also address implications, in terms of communication and coordination, of cultural diversity within teams."

This paper theoretically expands upon a primarily case-study approach in the NGO network literature that samples a few organizations partnering for specific projects in three ways. First, we assert that three mechanisms by which social movements can effectively exert influence- mobilization, seizing political opportunities, and framing issues- may be fruitfully generalized to other types of NGOs as factors necessary for success. Second, we identify some common motivations for partnering that are not project-specific, which can be used to identify network linkages and ultimately to create network configurations. Finally, we suggest some common patterns that may appear in the configuration of the resulting networks. This expansion is designed to permit examination of larger patterns of alliance networking among a broad base of organizations within the NGO sector."

In this paper, we will present and analyze a variety of data from the survey, demonstrating that, although no single remix cultural practice has yet achieved mainstream levels of prevalence, the collective impact of these various practices, unified by the new ethic of configurability, have achieved mainstream proportions. We will also explore some of the write-in responses volunteered by our more than 1,700 respondents, demonstrating that the legal, moral and ontological dimensions of these new practices continue to remain vague at best, even among their most enthusiastic practitioners."
2007-1037,"No Emotion, No Sympathy: The Visual Construction of a Murder Trial in the Press",Taking Visual Representation in the News Seriously,,,,Paper,"No Emotion, No Sympathy: The Visual Construction of a Murder Trial in the Press",Taking Visual Representation in the News Seriously,"This paper examines the visual press coverage of a notorious murder trial in 3 center-right British newspapers. In August 2002, 2 young girls were abducted and murdered. The school caretaker Ian Huntley was convicted of murdering the girls and his girlfriend Maxine Carr was convicted of the lesser crime of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. She remains a national hate figure and was granted indefinite anonymity by the High Court for her own protection. This paper focuses on the visual representation of Carr, in an attempt to understand why public loathing towards her remains so intense considering she was found guilty of a relatively minor crime. A content analysis and qualitative visual analysis were undertaken on the trial coverage published in the Times, the Daily Mail, and the Sun. The content analysis demonstrated that images of Carr appeared more frequently than images of Huntley, and were often larger and reproduced in color. The qualitative visual analysis explored the placement and juxtaposition of the images with each other and with the headline text. We found disturbing evidence of newspaper formatting which could only encourage readers to draw misleading conclusions about Carrs role in the crime. The visual coverage in the press told a very different story than the one which formed the basis for her sentence. We argue the influence of newspaper page layout and image montages are too frequently overlooked by journalism scholars, but it should not be underestimated, particularly in terms of the reporting of high-profile crimes."

Although the two sources were found to be equally substantive, are they equally informative? Using a motivated cognition theoretical approach, this study examines whether viewers may actually process and remember substantive information better when it is presented on The Daily Show than when it is presented on more serious sources of political information. Specifically, the study predicts that viewers will be more aroused and appetitively engaged and thus will allocate more processing resources and encode more information while viewing presidential election campaign stories on The Daily Show than while viewing campaign stories on the network newscasts."

next generation of the World Wide Web. Academic research shows polarized findings concerning
webloggings social role as an alternative way of news reporting. Several studies suggest that the
entire blogsphere has been normalized by mainstream media and loses its identity as a critic and a
challenger. This study investigates five top non-journalist weblogs and finds that they still remain
substantial editorial independence, deliberately keep distance to mainstream media, and often
criticize them. Although this study successfully challenges the earlier notion, the limitations are
discussed, eliciting new research directions for future blog studies."
2007-1040,Nonverbal Cues in Mobile Phone Text Messages: The Effects of Chronemics and Proxemics,"High-Density Session: Computers and People, Social Networking Sites, and",,,,Paper,Nonverbal Cues in Mobile Phone Text Messages: The Effects of Chronemics and Proxemics,"High-Density Session: Computers and People, Social Networking Sites, and","SMS communication as a mobile form of computer-mediated communication (CMC) is first and foremost text-based or verbal communication. As previous research revealed, text-based computer-mediated communication does not lack non-verbal cues. E-mail messages and mobile phone text messages (SMS messages) for instance include automatic time stamps displaying the point in time when the message was sent out. The sending time of a digital message can be interpreted as a non-verbal cue in the chronemics (interpersonal management of time) code system. In an experimental study on the chronemics of e-mail messages, Walther and Tidwell (1995) demonstrated that people perceive the same message content quite differently in terms of intimacy/liking and dominance/submissiveness depending on the time stamp (e.g. a private message is perceived as more intimate if sent out at night as opposed to daytime). Following up on the chronemics paradigm of Walther and Tidwell (1995) this paper presents the design and results of an experimental study on SMS chronemics. A further experiment also looked at the proxemics (interpersonal management of space) code system. The automatic localization of mobile phone users is already possible via the cellular network or satellite positioning systems. Therefore not only automatic time stamps but also location stamps can be added to the sent-out messages. It is argued, that people perceive SMS content differently according to the physical distance or proximity of the SMS sender. The chapter not only describes the experimental paradigms and new results but also summarizes the current state of research on CMC chronemics and proxemics."
2007-1041,Nordic Newspapers on the EU: European Political Communication After Non and Nee,European News and European Politics: Universalism Versus Difference,,,,ractive Paper (Poster),Nordic Newspapers on the EU: European Political Communication After Non and Nee,European News and European Politics: Universalism Versus Difference,"Two previous studies, inspired by Grounded Theory, based on data from four Nordic newspapers in 1993 and 1996, generated 3 theoretical categories that turned out to be central to the research area European political communication: participation, legitimacy, and mondialization/ universalism. The present study used data from the same Nordic newspapers in 2005, shortly after the referenda on the proposed new EU constitution in France and the Netherlands to test the validity of these categories, applying similar methods. There was a general fit, in the sense that the categories seemed to work well also with data from this period. However, some of the empirical material seemed to demand a new category, which was labeled identity. Finally, the categories were rearranged into 2 levels, where participation was the core category, based on the Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft figure of thought, and the 3 other categories were defined as supporting categories in the analysis of Nordic media coverage of the European Union. The Nordic newspapers contributed in differing degrees to a European political communication, e g in debating European issues more or less intensively. One macrosocial factor accounting for these differences may be the observed difference in political culture."
2007-1042,"No Strangers to Fiction: The Journalistic Novel as ""New"" Variation Upon an ""Old"" Literary Tradition",What Makes the Way Journalism Tells Stories Special?,,,,Paper,"No Strangers to Fiction: The Journalistic Novel as ""New"" Variation Upon an ""Old"" Literary Tradition",What Makes the Way Journalism Tells Stories Special?,"Many of what can be called ""journalistic"" novels  fictional or semifictional prose works built around real people and real life events -- have been written by ex-journalists who went on to become famous literary figures. This paper examines the way these novelists utilized journalistic methodologies as the basis for developing realistic plots and journalistic research to provide the material for a literature that draws upon actual events as the inspiration for dramatic narrative. In assessing the importance of the pseudo-factual novel within the literary tradition, this study goes beyond the examination of what has been called literary journalism and the nonfiction novel and analyzes the role of fiction built upon a journalistic foundation. In doing this, this paper hopes to expand the understanding of journalisms contribution to the literary tradition and lead to a broader picture of the influence of journalistic methods upon the literary canon."
2007-1043,Notes on Islamic Popular Culture,"Media as Contested Spaces of Religious/Spiritual Evolution: Rituals, Spectacles, Commodities, and Markets",,,,Paper,Notes on Islamic Popular Culture,"Media as Contested Spaces of Religious/Spiritual Evolution: Rituals, Spectacles, Commodities, and Markets","This paper addresses the emerging phenomenon of Islamic popular culture. The media explosion that has swept the Arab and Islamic worlds since the early 1990s has triggered heated controversies about Western influence, gender roles, public piety, and political participation. In this context, the most intense debates have been concerned with the social and cultural impact of music videos and reality television. As hybrid cultural forms blending Western formats with Arabic content, these genres are said to violate prevailing notions of halal (permissible) and haram (prohibited) and to subvert values that some clerics ruled to be essential to the Muslim way of life. Perhaps in response, the past few years have seen the development of what I have termed Islamic pop, which appropriates formal characteristics of music videos and reality television shows to produce Islamized versions. Based on fieldwork and textual analysis, this paper focuses on theoretical issues of authenticity, modernity and public piety."
2007-1044,"Not ""Getting-On"": Older Nonusers Meanings for Computers",Digital Inequality,,,,Paper,"Not ""Getting-On"": Older Nonusers Meanings for Computers",Digital Inequality,"This study is based on focus groups with elderly non-users of computers recruited from senior citizens organizations in the North Island of New Zealand. Eighty-three participants participated in the focus groups. Findings suggest participants meanings for the computer were identifiable in relation to four major themes: (a) the useful tool, (b) the inter-generational connector, (c) the not-personally-necessary-device, and (d) the socially disruptive machine. In addition, partial explanations for participants meanings for computers were identifiable in relation to two other themes: (a) good servants, but poor masters; and (b) needs, not wants. Participants meanings for computers, as represented in the themes, were developed in relation to a repertoire of interpretive resources acquired over a lifetime. Drawing on this set of resources, participants critically evaluated the technology in terms of their own lives and in relation to their perceptions of technologys place in society."
2007-1045,Not Your Father's Internet: The Generation Gap in Online Politics,Digital Media and Youth Civic Engagement,,,,Paper,Not Your Father's Internet: The Generation Gap in Online Politics,Digital Media and Youth Civic Engagement,"Youth have historically been at the forefront of trends in new information technology, remaining near the top of internet usage statistics and distinguishing themselves as early-adopters of features like instant-messaging and peer-to-peer networking. Despite a slight spike in youth turnout during the last presidential election, youth have also typically been understood as trendsetters in the area of declining social capital, positioned at the forefront of falling rates of civic engagement and political participation. With the dramatic growth in online political communication, many hope that new media might hold the potential to help reverse declines in civic engagement among American youth. Based on our content analyses and focus groups conducted between 2000 and 2004, however, we believe there are strong reasons to remain skeptical of any simple technical fix for the problems of youth engagement. Specifically, our data suggest a yawning gap in web sensibilities between youth and traditional political actors."

Subsequently, the saliency of obesity as a health dilemma has increased proportionally within the American medical community and within the American mass media. The purpose of this research study is two-fold: to explore how the term obesity is framed in 3 general news magazines and to determine how that framing compares to the way society has framed the term. This qualitative study employs a constant comparative frame analysis to identify dominant frames within these news magazines between 1990 and 2005. Results indicate that, while there is some similarity, the predominant frames found in social discourse do not wholly parallel with media frames."

This study examined the potential influence of structural bias on worker assimilation framed by Van Maanen and Scheins (1979) model indicating that workers assimilate by crossing inclusionary, functional, and hierarchical boundaries. Interviews conducted with 23 workers compared assimilation experiences of Caucasian males to minorities and women. Among the findings were that women and minorities reported obstacles to crossing inclusionary boundaries related to workgroup adaptation. Nonnative English speakers said crossing functional and inclusionary boundaries was impeded when Americans paid little attention to their ideas. Women and minority workers said that Caucasian men were the only likely leaders in their organizations, an indication of difficulties to cross hierarchical boundaries. Caucasian males did not report experiencing these challenges and mostly were unaware of these obstacles for minorities and women."
2007-1048,Occupying the Floor in Political Press Conferences: A Study on Interaction and Territorial Power,Creating Opposition and Pursuing its Possibilities,,,,Paper,Occupying the Floor in Political Press Conferences: A Study on Interaction and Territorial Power,Creating Opposition and Pursuing its Possibilities,"The overall aim of this paper is to investigate how the access to the floor is decided and regulated in political press conferences. The study is based on a combination of conversation analysis of institutional interaction and a territorial model of power. The opportunity to occupy the floor in competition with others is analyzed with a focus on the organization of talk-in-interaction, various interactional mechanisms and techniques for the allocation of turns. The material consists of transcriptions from press conferences in four different contexts. Five themes are analyzed: (1) The configuration of actors and relations, (2) Institutional arrangements and the preallocation of turns, (3) Techniques for allocating, giving and taking turns, (4) Overlapping talk in the competition of question turns, (5) Interruptions. The results show the significance of developing research on political interviews so that it includes both question and answer designs, and territorial aspects of interaction. Focusing on adversarialness in question design can give a picture of a critically investigative journalism and journalist-controlled press conferences. Through analyses of the allocation of turns and interruptions we can see that the same press conferences are politician-controlled, dominated by politicians who have exclusive access to specific turns and who can react to hostile questions with confrontational interruptions."
2007-1049,Of Each and All: Vietnam Memorialization and Pastoral Power,"Conflict, War, and Visuals (High Density Session)",,,,Paper,Of Each and All: Vietnam Memorialization and Pastoral Power,"Conflict, War, and Visuals (High Density Session)","The Vietnam War still maintains immense cultural significance within American collective memory. Previous studies of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial have largely focused on either individual meaning produced by the memorial or the significance of the structure in recuperating a singular national identity. Rather than seeing these readings as antagonistic, this study suggests that a single rationality confirms that both perspectives are partially correct. Using the Galveston County Vietnam Memorial to establish a basis for comparison, this study suggests that both participate in a larger cultural formation based on what Michel Foucault identifies as pastoral power. This type of formation advances a form of reasoned governance based on the care of each and all in the population. The paper concludes by suggesting that scholars ought to investigate how the arrangement of memorials enables certain possibilities for individual and collective memory to emerge as reasonable within a particular cultural context."

In this twenty-minute training documentary, a police captain explains the need to document our sex perverts as a sting operation, complete with a careful description of how the filming was performed, graphic depictions of sex and even more disturbing descriptions of the resulting long incarcerations of the filmed subjects are shown and described. In the last forty years, this film has circulated as training by the state, as socialite pornography, as a film archivist oddity and as a bizarre queer cult classic. The multiple meanings and uses of this documentation of a particular cultural form of sexual exchange (sex in public bathrooms) in itself provides a history of how documenting queerness has morphed since the 1960s."
2007-1051,Older People's Television Viewing as Part of Selection and Compensation Strategies,tructional & Developmental Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Older People's Television Viewing as Part of Selection and Compensation Strategies,Instructional & Developmental Communication Interactive Paper Session,"The aim of this qualitative study is to advance theoretical notions on how television viewing is part of older peoples selection and compensation strategies. These strategies show how people adapt to gains and losses (P.B. Baltes & M.B. Baltes, 1990), and these concepts contribute to the understanding of how media use changes in response to development across the life span. Older widows (N=22; 66 to 90 years old) were interviewed and their accounts of how they adjust their television viewing in reaction to development in old age were analyzed. Television viewing is part of selection strategies in 2 ways. First, respondents use television to meet new goals that have become more important because of development during old age. Second, respondents give television a new function in response to a change in the availability or desirability of other domains. Television is part of a compensation strategy when, in reaction to a loss, people use television to take over a function that was previously fulfilled by something else."
2007-1052,On HIV Disclosure: A Literature Review,Health Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,On HIV Disclosure: A Literature Review,Health Communication Interactive Paper Session,"There is a strong body of research on HIV disclosure centered between 2 areas, (1) disclosure to family and friends, and (2) disclosure to casual and main partners. Topics within this first area include correlates of HIV serostatus admission by adult children to their parents and other family members, the actual disclosure conversations, reactions during the admission process, and long-term implications of serostatus disclosure. As for the second area of research, topics tend to also include correlates of serostatus admission to casual and main partners, and casual and main partners reactions to the information. The following paper digests all of these subjects, and also highlights the paradoxes intrinsic to HIV disclosurethat fundamental communication theories (e.g., social penetration theory) suggest serostatus admission, albeit necessary for public safety, can ultimately be a communication violation."

culture changes the territory on which we engage with journalism.
Borrowing from a range of prisms for thinking about journalism -- as a
craft, a profession, an institution, a set of practices, a group of
people, a mindset -- thinking about journalism as culture offers a
variegated and porous way to think about journalism through multiple
lenses. In so doing, it reflects effectively the dynamic nature of
journalistic practice in its contemporary forms and hopefully brings us
closer to answering the question of why journalism ultimately matters."

An Exploration of Online Political News Coverage and Hostile Media Phenomenon,Making and Using Online News: Reports on the Accelerating Global News Cycle,,,,ractive Paper (Poster),Online and Ticked Off? An Exploration of Online Political News Coverage and Hostile Media Phenomenon,Making and Using Online News: Reports on the Accelerating Global News Cycle,"In this paper, I explore whether the hostile media phenomenon  the belief that media are not just biased, but biased against ones own opinion  applies to online media content. While Internet content has been the subject of considerable attention in terms of perceived bias, credibility, and accuracy, no study has looked at the applicability of the hostile media phenomenon to this new online medium. Looking at news coverage of the 2004 presidential election, I investigate whether the hostile media phenomenon applies to online news coverage, how it compares with other kinds of coverage, and what mediating and moderating factors might explain the relationships. The data for this study come from a survey of a nationwide sample of 1,506 adults conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press from Dec. 19, 2003 to Jan. 4, 2004. Hierarchical regressions were conducted to determine the extent to which different types of news sources  television, newspapers, and the Internet  predict perceptions of general media bias and the perceived hostile media effect after controlling for demographics, political orientations, and media use. Findings suggest that different media channels elicit different perceptions of both media bias and hostile media bias. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that media bias and hostile media bias behave differently in different media. These differences are important to understand and explore in light of the growth of new media like the World Wide Web and old medias response to it."
2007-1055,Online Communities: Understanding Organizational Processes,Online Communities and Organizations: New Theoretical Directions,,,,Paper,Online Communities: Understanding Organizational Processes,Online Communities and Organizations: New Theoretical Directions,"Within the realm of online communities research, the lack of an overarching framework that is relatively independent of specific technological manifestations has made systematic comparisons difficult across communities and has impeded the development and application of theory within this domain. Data are accumulating but lack theoretical infrastructure that can serve as a basis for synthesis and integration.
Why is a theoretical infrastructure critical? In addition to its potential to support synthesis and integration, theory offers guidance as to where to direct future empirical work, motivating systematic research programs rather than fragmented individual studies. Theory also offers a basis for generating a priori hypotheses and for focusing on generalizable conclusions. The present work aims to present a number of interacting dimensions for making distinctions among communities that are interrelated and embedded in a larger theoretical framework."

This paper traces the evolution of the Lage Raho Munnabhai (LRM) wiki page from its inception in June 2006. This paper discusses the multiple roles of five archetypal collaborators in sustaining the wiki page. The paper argues that these archetypal contributors/collaboration form the basis of a self-governing control units, Communication Control Unit (CCU), and proliferate in the asynchronous, online communication environments made possible by server technology, such as, wiki. While studying the phenomenon of CCU, this paper analyzes the strengths and drawbacks of CCU and their evolving roles in the content and control of online communication."

Drawing on a representative national sample of over 1000 Americans who report having participated in chat rooms or discussion forums in the past year, we examine the types of online discussion spaces that create opportunities for cross-cutting political discussion. Our findings suggest that the potential for true deliberation occurs primarily in chat rooms where politics comes up only incidentally, but is not the central purpose of the online space. We discuss the implications of our findings for the contributions of the internet toward a public sphere."
2007-1059,Online Journalism and the Other: Creating New Spaces for Human Rights Issues in India,Journalism and Human Rights,,,,Paper,Online Journalism and the Other: Creating New Spaces for Human Rights Issues in India,Journalism and Human Rights,"Enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) is the basis premise that all people matter, a moral commitment to overcoming the culture of othering permeating everyday life around the globe. This premise, when considered in relation to the priorities and protocols of Western journalism, throws into sharp relief the ways in which certain us and them dichotomies inflected in news reports recurrently counterpoise the structural interests of people like us against the suffering of strangers. Increasingly it is the case, however, that online news reporting is being heralded for its potential to help break down these dichotomies. At stake is its perceived capacity to create discursive spaces for empathetic engagement  of bearing witness  at a distance, especially where human rights violations are concerned. This paper offers an evaluative assessment of this potential, both in theoretical terms and with respect to its practical realisation vis-a-vis specific initiatives underway in India. Specifically, the emergent forms and practices of citizen journalism in India will be examined, devoting particular attention to the online reporting of human rights issues in conflict-ridden areas (such as the insurgencies in north-east sector of the country) typically neglected by older, more traditional news media. A case study of several citizen-based news sites, such as North-East News Agency (www.nenanews.com), forms the evidential basis of this papers analysis."

Technical fixes are never completely effective and too many users do not feel that is their responsibility to take protective measures themselves. Building on Protection Motivation Theory, we examine the factors that affect safe online behaviors and propose and test new variables that encourage Internet users to enact protective behavior through online interventions.

Today, news can be seen 24/7 on specialized public and commercial TV channels, in a growing amount of newspapers, and of course via the Internet. Thus the nature of news reporting has changed dramatically. This has been the case especially since the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center in New York and the second Gulf war. Television news reporting has increasingly been using footage created by lay people or from cameras mounted on military vehicles. In addition, many people use the Internet to upload their own footage and specialized web logs are increasingly being used as news sources and as outlets to comment on the news. This presentation will discuss what such changes might mean to news consumers in terms of their perceived"

Several attempts have been made to identify the psychological and/ or cognitive underpinnings of TPP. Most of the studies simply speculated about the relationship between TPP and other perceptual phenomena like (1) optimistic bias, (2) hostile media phenomenon, (3) self-enhancement, (4) impersonal impact, and (5) pluralistic ignorance. Only a few studies have tried to examine the empirical relation between these factors. A survey among 453 respondents was conducted. The questionnaire contained measures for each of the phenomena mentioned above. The data reveal that there are no such correlations between TPP and other perceptual phenomena. Reasons for the obvious uniqueness of TPP are discussed."

Student respondents (N=517) were requested to estimate the prevalence of criminality, single parent families and sexual activity among teens in the society. The given estimates were compared to real world figures and to TV world values that were obtained from a content analysis of one week of prime-time network programming (66 hours from three different channels). The results confirm to cultivation predictions by pointing at differences between heavy viewers and light viewers, so that heavy viewers give extremer estimates, but the findings also indicate that the impact of the question format is greater than the effect of cultivation, and that the amount of viewing and the question format interact so that cultivation is more visible in open-ended questionnaires."
2007-1065,Oprah Winfrey's Media Expansion and the Everyday Lives of Women,Getting Real: Gendered TV Politics,,,,Paper,Oprah Winfrey's Media Expansion and the Everyday Lives of Women,Getting Real: Gendered TV Politics,"Oprah Winfrey’s various enterprises constitute a polysemy, generating both conservative and progressive meanings depending on their context and audiences. As an entity, however, the whole Winfrey enterprise ultimately becomes a conservative phenomenon or “text,” working to inscribe and enforce the idea of the American Dream. Because this conservative text continues to target a primarily female audience, and because Winfrey continues to be associated with the claim to empower women, we need to uncover the implications of this conservative reading for feminist discourse. This is more keenly pressing since Winfrey is seemingly in a position to speak for American women, both through her own various media outlets as well as through those acknowledged and respected sources such as Newsweek who marked her as Woman of the New Century. The stakes therefore become more intense when the claim to empower women is seen as a claim on the voice of women. This paper examines questions about the role of Harpo media products in the everyday lives of women, and how The Oprah Winfrey Show in particular continues to hail its audience. In addition, it considers how our understanding of the Winfrey phenomenon might be further illuminated through audience studies. I analyze one particular Oprah Message Board to consider Winfrey’s expansion into new media and its position intersecting the Winfrey message of self-empowerment, i.e., self-reliance, with reading, with authorial intent, and with real and measurable audiences. This message board exemplifies the potential these and other Internet boards hold for audience and reception studies."

This paper investigates how the success of oracular prophecy is built upon languages tendency to fail. To achieve this end prophecy is examined as a performative speech act. Discovered is that, due to part its future anterior structure, the prophecy as performative navigates its way through languages slippage to emerge triumphant. Austin and Derridas work on the performative are revisited while Lacan is utilized to discuss the future anterior. Prophecy is suggested to be a performative par excellence in that it relies neither upon context nor intention, and evades temporal specificity."
2007-1067,Orchestrating the Debate on the EU Constitution: The Representation of Social Actors in Polish and French Quality Press,Audience Perspectives on the European Public Sphere,,,,Paper,Orchestrating the Debate on the EU Constitution: The Representation of Social Actors in Polish and French Quality Press,Audience Perspectives on the European Public Sphere,"National media focused on general political information are considered to be a central vehicle for the articulation of a wide range of actors claims on European issues. This paper assesses the conditions of such articulations from a media-sociological and discourse analytical perspective. It compares the highly polarized debates on the EU Constitution in two Polish and two French major quality press outlets, scrutinizing frames, sources and actor representations. The paper finds that news production mechanisms and discursive practices disadvantage bottom-up contributions and favor nation-centered perspectives. Polish and French media present the EU Constitutional process as a matter concerning only national politicians, experts and intellectuals. Societal actors are marginalized. Instead, they use alternative formats, such as commentary functions in newspapers online editions. The findings illuminate a lack of inclusiveness of the traditional quality press and point to the limits of the creation of a European public sphere."
2007-1068,Organizational Form and Structure of the Global Justice Movement,Networks and Typologies,,,,Paper,Organizational Form and Structure of the Global Justice Movement,Networks and Typologies,"The globalization process accelerated since the twentieth century has appeared as a powerful flow accompanying the information and communication revolution. Globalization has become one of the most important factors whose effects have permeated into every part of contemporary human life. Moreover, various forms of social inequality in the global context which have been exacerbated by the neo-liberal globalization process in this period have triggered the rise of the global justice movement. As witnessed in the successful mobilization of Seattle in 1999 and afterward protests, the social justice movements have been performed in an agile and effective manner. They are, in fact, highly globalized in terms of their organizations and ways of performance. They acknowledged the power of global networking technology and positively adopted it to their mobilization process. Despites some limitations, new aspects are characterized in their performances coupled with their organizational form, various identities, and unique network culture. The research examines the structure and culture of the global justice movements organization which is related to their unique performances. The distributed network organization and its decentralized and horizontal structure affect the organizational culture. Forms and culture of the social justice movement also enable the active digital networking mobilization and multiplicity in their identities and ideologies. This study concludes that the social justice movement has suggested a meaningful example for future direction of the organizational form and structure."

Existing research has primarily focused on the use of single media. Perspectives on media combinations have been limited and de-contextualized attending mainly to characteristics of such use, leaving out practices emerging in the organizational context in the intersection between the individual and the collective. Grounded Theory was used to analyse multiple datasets consisting of documents, observations, ad-hoc and semi-structured interviews, during a 6-month period in a department of a Fortune 500 company. The findings resulted in 3 interrelated and contextual bounded practices evolving from media combinations, namely (1) media cycling practices, containing 10 sub-types; (2) fluid-interdependent media practices, identified by both multiple clusters of people as a result of task complexity, and practical and cognitive challenges structuring the use of multiple and shared databases; (3) Puzzle zone practices, in which clusters of people in formalized meetings or informal settings try to solve challenges through aligning multiple bits and pieces of information according to goals and strategies. These practices identify challenges related to an operational working environment characterized by a constant flow of information and multiple interdependencies."

If it is acknowledged that communicating is inherently relational, and relating is inherently communicative, and that the coevolution of organizing and networking is achieved through communicative means, then all actions in networks have to be examined as of potentially communicative value to others. As an initial attempt to gauge the implications of such a conceptualization, this paper focuses on network actors as employing cognitive frames to make sense of observed networking behavior that is relevant to them. Issues discussed in reference to the relating as communicating postulate include social actors as contextualizing ties, structural constraints on subjective sense-making, network opacity, routinized interpolation, cross-level coevolution, and temporal aspects. Theoretical as well as methodological implications of such a communication-centered approach to the study of multidimensional networks as outlined in Monge and Contractors (2003) multitheoretical, multilevel (MTML) framework are discussed."

Public interest, the most widely referred policy principle behind public broadcasting, remains difficult to define. While previous studies on the public interest principle have focused on the normative, legal, or macro-political interactive processes between and among policy actors, this paper focuses on the internal politics within the sub-units or departments of a public broadcasting corporation. Based on a survey of employees across 10 departments, this study extracted 2 frames with which to interpret the public interest: public interest as a duty and public interest as a service. The relationship of these 2 frames with the organization members attitude toward the privatization of the public broadcasting system was then determined. The results show that organizational politics is more related to structural differences than to individual differences. This implies that the broadcasting industry is a dynamic coalition of heterogeneous groups and that organizational politics should be considered when formulating or implementing the public interest policy."

Crisis management is also a field that the relationship management paradigm can be applied to (Coombs, 2000). Coombs (2000) asserted that the public would analyze the same crisis situation differently according to their organization-public relationship. Kim (2004) stated that various organizational relationships affect crisis management and vice versa. Despite the importance and attention given to the organization-public relationship in crisis communication, there has been little examination of the practical effect of the public and organizations relationship in crises situations. Despite the importance of, and the research attention devoted to, organization-public relationship in crisis communication, there has been little empirical study that examines the practical effect of organizational public relationships in a crisis situation. The purpose of the study is twofold: to examine the impact of the organization-public relationship on perception toward a crisis and crisis communication; and, to empirically investigate the relation between perceptions toward the crisis and crisis communication. This paper begins with a brief review of organization-public relationship and then assesses the previous literature about crisis communication. Next, the research questions and hypothesis are introduced and the research design will be presented. Finally, the results will be reported and discussed."

We adopt a focus on embedded tensions to explore the dynamics involved with building alliances across aspects of (race, class, religion, and nation) difference. In accordance, we see TFNs as an illustrative case of organizing tensions found within globalized social change efforts. A preliminary survey of existing TFNs identifies three organizing tensions related to issues of funding, difference, and control. We describe the content of each reoccurring tension, providing illustrative examples of how various TFNs seek to manage them. A final section discusses how these tensions provide additional insight into the enactment of collective action within transnational spaces."

Borrowing from anthropological, historical, and literary sources, this critical research has explored televisions contemporary narrative traditions as ""ways of knowing"" and forms of public thought that systematically distort and magnify aspects of the commonsense world. In proposing a critical vocabulary more attuned to the nature of mass mediated texts, Cawelti (1976) calls for a canon more sensitive to persistent themes, serial narration, celebrity performance and enduring influence in the best popular products. Presumably, informed by such a canon, critics can 1) identify features of ""popular"" texts that gain purchase in the marketplace 2) assess the influence these texts have on other popular texts and 3) describe how these texts are assimilated into ongoing cultural practices. This critical analysis examines the introductory monologues of NBC's long-running The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson (270 monologues have been logged) to assess the use of comic commentary and social-typing (Celebrity-Signifiers) in scanning and interpreting the shifting norms and values in contemporary American experience. The reach and function of this unique collective discourse is arguably one of the more significant phenomena in American popular culture and will be evaluated from an historical and theoretical perspective."

Initial national findings reveal that concepts of 'press freedom' and 'freedom of speech' are re-interpreted in the press so that in every case they are framed within, and consequently reflect, a very particular vision of national identity. Even when differences between particular newspapers, often with very different political perspectives and audience profiles, are taken into account there is still an overarching
'national narrative'. We will be looking at the examples of three countries: The United Kingdom, France and Israel and examining the way in which the debates in each of these countries were framed. We will be looking at the way in which newspapers defined ""others"" both internal and external, and at how these definitions helped to build a very particular vision of the ""national character"" which was then used either to excuse or explain decisions relating to the cartoons."

Therefore, an interaction between educational or cultural variables and the effect can not be excluded. To examine if exemplification effects are independent from age and education or social and cultural traits, three field experiments were conducted, using quota samples to reach a maximum of variance for the personal traits of the participants. Experiment 1 (629 subjects) is a one-factor-design showing a stable effect independent from education. Experiment 2 (383 subjects) is a 2x2 design confirming that even preconceptions and existing knowledge do not prevent exemplification effects. Experiment 3 (434 subjects) is a 2x2 experiment testing the same stimulus material in Siberia (Russia) and Germany showing cross-cultural exemplification effects. Implications of these results for exemplification theory are discussed."

Manipulated variables were crossed with inhalant usage status (nonuser, nonusing intender, and user). Analysis disclosed significant effects on message evaluation of target and status (p<.01), and significant interactions of status with each of the manipulated variables. Users were resistant to threatened physical harms, but this variable did not differentially affect nonusers or intenders. Users and intenders evaluated the message more positively when targeted indirectly (p<.05). Intenders were more susceptible to peer sources, whereas users preferred adults. Message evaluation was significantly associated with inhalant usage intentions (r=-.22). This association held even after the contributions of sex, sensation seeking, acculturation, prior use, familism, and assumed peer usage were accounted for in a multiple regression analysis (overall R2 = .24)."

For many, such coverage has become a symbol of an unethical and unrestrained press; for others, it is a symptom of an increasingly competitive marketplace. In many countries, the public, governments, lawmakers and others have called for more regulations, additional laws and/or judicial intervention to rein in what they consider to be excessive privacy intrusion by the media. Efforts to define the relationship between the press and privacy rights have ranged from anti-paparazzi legislation passed in California to far-reaching decisions by the European Court of Human Rights that news photographers cannot take pictures of royal families on public streets. In Hong Kong, where rambunctious media and their puppy packs of paparazzi compete ever more fiercely in a minimally restrictive legal environment, escalating community concern may bring about radical changes in the law."
2007-1082,Paradigm Repackaging: Professional Mouthpiece,Between Commerce and Coercion: Emerging Paradigms in Chinese Journalism,,,,Paper,Paradigm Repackaging: Professional Mouthpiece,Between Commerce and Coercion: Emerging Paradigms in Chinese Journalism,"This study rethinks the journalistic paradigm shift in Chinese media. Rather than being challenged by professionalism, the dominant paradigm of journalism as mouthpiece is repackaged with techniques of professionalism to achieve greater effects under the changing circumstance of economic reform. Based on a field study in a news program in CCTV (China Central Television) and discourse analysis on its news products, this study concludes that journalists are highly aware of their mouthpiece role but also adept at professional skills in their news reporting. The findings conclude 3 parts: First, the discourse analysis on new productions could help generate a mouthpiece style at work, which allows journalists to be critical on news events and meanwhile play safe in party line; second, journalists in newsrooms have been exposed to an ideological training from their superior; third, the sense of professionalism and self-fulfillment mainly grow in a forbidden zone attributed to conflicts among different interest groups other than the state control."

Respondents also reported their perceived similarity and social attraction to the character, and the extent to which they had tried to change aspects of themselves to be more like the character (change/influence). Across the whole sample, parasocial interaction, but not identification, was a significant predictor of reported change/influence. When the 3 character types were compared, greater similarity and identification were reported for liked and neutral characters than for disliked characters. Parasocial interaction and social attraction were higher for liked than for neutral characters, which in turn were higher than disliked characters. With regard to predictors of change/influence, only education and perceived similarity were significant for all 3 characters types, with less education and greater similarity associated with more efforts to become like the character. Parasocial interaction was a significant predictor for liked characters only, whereas gender, social attraction, and identification were not significant for any of the 3 character types."

HBO's efforts to brand itself in opposition to the rest of television contradict some of the basic operating principles upon which the pay network relies in order to remain profitable. HBO executives have seemingly bought into the pay station's own rhetoric and have created a work culture that, at times, appears at odds with HBO's own long range profitability and sustainability."
2007-1085,Parental Mediation: Age and Family Structure as Predictors of Mediation Styles,Parental Mediation of Childrens Television Exposure,,,,Paper,Parental Mediation: Age and Family Structure as Predictors of Mediation Styles,Parental Mediation of Childrens Television Exposure,"The current investigation examines how family structure and child development stages influence parental mediation styles of television viewing. Research pertaining to parental mediation suggests that there are three general styles of mediation for television: active, restrictive, and coviewing (Nathanson, 1991, 2002; Valkenburg, Krcmar, Peeters, & Marseille, 1999). Olsons (1993) circumplex model posits that family functioning is based on two primary dimensions, adaptability and cohesion. These two dimensions are linked to decision making, rules, and communication patterns within the family. Therefore, based on a familys level of adaptability and cohesion, it can be suggested that parents might choose certain mediation styles to use with their children. Additionally, as a child develops morally and cognitively, a parent might be more likely to use different styles of mediation versus others. Research questions address the impact of family structure and development stage of children in regards to parents choice of mediation styles. The questionnaire included measures on family structure, television mediation, childrens moral and cognitive development, and demographic variables. Results and discussion follow."

However, theories of social cognition and motivation would predict that support for media literacy interventions may vary as a function of certain individual differences. In order to examine this assumption this paper compares 111 parents degree of support for instructional, restrictive and pressure strategies across three types of content (sexual, violent and advertising). Individual preference for certain protective strategies over others is dependent on media content and presents a challenge for media literacy interventions and parental mediations. Theoretical implications the third-person effect are also discussed."
2007-1087,Parents Risk Perception and the Uniformity of Parental Mediation of Television Content,Parental Mediation of Childrens Television Exposure,,,,Paper,Parents Risk Perception and the Uniformity of Parental Mediation of Television Content,Parental Mediation of Childrens Television Exposure,"Supervising childrens television viewing habits becomes increasingly challenging as children divide up their time between multiple households. This study examines the extent of parental mediation of television content but primarily focuses on its context. It will do so by investigating the consistency in and enforcement of mediation efforts and by relating these to parents' concerns about the effects of media content on their children. Minimal research addresses the uniformity with which each parent applies mediation efforts when children live in multiple households. Using a random-digit-dial survey, this comparative study will examine risk perception, parental mediation, and parents evaluation of success in reducing effects of various television content among parents of children residing in single and multiple households. Results of this study will inform the current body of literature by characterizing the unique nature of these challenges and detailing the extent to which parents reinforce television rules relative to their successes."

In a survey among 360 parent-child dyads (children aged 8-12 years), we (a) investigate how parent-child agreement varies by child age, child sex, and family communication style, and (b) examine the role of child-reported mediation in the relation between parent-reported mediation and advertising-induced materialism (i.e., the mediation outcome). Overall, parent and child reports were moderately correlated yet showed similar strength in predicting the mediation outcome. However, parent-child agreement was considerably higher among older children, girls, and high communication-oriented families. In addition, structural equation modeling analysis showed that parent-reported mediation was (1) related to child-reported mediation, which (2) negatively affected advertising-induced materialism. Our findings suggest that child-reports are an indicator of childrens selective perception of parental mediation activities, and are a key variable in predicting the mediation outcome."

A framing analysis of programs specifically made for children discuss when African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American characters appeared and how they were depicted. Because television has been called a childs early window, an analysis of the characterizations adds insight into how children perceive race in the real world. This study also looks at where racially diverse characters appear in the television schedule to determine if children have access to these portrayals."

The unusual fairness of his skin allowed him to enlist as a white private during the conflict. After the war, Silk did not undo the confusion. He decided to be a white man, even if this meant to definitely break with his family. Neither his wife, nor his children know or suspect anything about their fathers past. He also developed a brilliant career at the academia as a white man. Ironically, Silk is accused of discriminating against African-American students 50 years later. This paper analyzes de role of public opinion in the inquisitorial process against the professor accused of racism. Public opinion creates a pressure to homogenize thinking and to establish moral standards that identify a society and allow its members to identify themselves with it."

The nature of the study was a simulated physician-patient interaction. Participants were 40 Canadians and 40 Chinese who formed 40 dyads in four experimental conditions: Canadian physician/Canadian patient, Chinese physician/Chinese patient, Chinese physician/Canadian patient, and Canadian physician/Chinese patient. All conversations were videotaped and microanalyzed. The data generated three intriguing findings. 1) There were significant positive correlations between backchannel responses and listener recall scores in the two intracultural groups, indicating that backchannel responses facilitated content communication. 2) There were significant negative correlations between backchannel responses and listener recall scores in the two intercultural groups, indicating that backchannel responses might have served as misleading feedback and caused mis-communication. 3) The Chinese/Chinese condition had the highest backchannel responses; the Canadian/Canadian condition had the lowest with the two intercultural groups in between. This finding provides support for the Communication Accommodation theory. Implications for verbal and nonverbal communication training in intercultural interactions were discussed."

In 2004, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has called on governments to encourage the development of broadband, emphasizing its importance for economic, social and cultural development it will bring.
South Korea already has 2/3 of its households subscribing to broadband service. The ratio of broadband users in Korea is three times higher than that of Japan or the United States. This was possible because the Korean government assisted the penetration of broadband by policy, as well as a strong support from the private sector. Among a number of factors that contributed, this article focuses on one factor that has arguably stroke the match to start this broadband revolution in Korea: a new form of business called PC-bang."

My aim is to trace how a common national normality was redefined/performed through the celebrification and humanization of political figures in the popular media, and how celebrity discourse has reshaped the understanding of the ""national ordinary"" and contributed to the individualization of political trust. The paper suggests that the stories on national politicians and their domestic life in women's magazines, were one of the key discurses/institutions through which the audiences have come to imagine themselves as members of reethnicized national community. The photo-interviews of photo-essays of representative families and the entanglement of family and nation are to be understood as part of the hegemonic struggle to define not just national community but also hegemonic masculinity, femininity, the notion of family and domestic normality."

Berrin Beasley

Pepper Dennis is a modern woman: Smart. Chic. Sexy. And (gasp!) single. She's Chicago TV's leading local news journalist, but despite the serious stories she breaksexposing a crooked politician or dangerous college hazing ritualsthe show's emphasis is on Pepper's continuing single status. In a nod to modern feminism, no one at the office questions a woman's ability to get the job done, just whether she can get it done and get married at the same time. In the fictional Chicago of ""Pepper Dennis"", it is no longer strictly a man's world, at least on the surface. A closer look at the formerly WB's now canceled show reveals that the portrayal of women as journalists is still a traditionally gendered representation that focuses more on women's bodies and love lives than on their professional accomplishments.

Constant conflict arises in the 13 episodes of this 2005-06 season series from the pressure Pepper's family puts on Pepper to choose marriage over career, a concern NOT expressed about any of the male reporters, anchors or production crew. And the show's premise, that Pepper is an ambitious reporter with her sights set on anchoring Chicago's top-rated evening news cast (a job that ultimately goes to a man) is really designed to showcase star Rebecca Romijn's famous 6-foot model's figure. In the season's first episode Pepper throws ethics to the wind by going undercover, as a scantily clad hooker (with plenty of close ups of Romijn's breasts while a giddy male camera operator tries to hook up her mic) to bust a prostitution ring operating as a respectable gentleman's club.

And while producers attempt to establish Pepper's credibility as a serious journalist by showing her cherishing a picture of herself with Walter Cronkite taken when she was girl, Pepper engages in the kind of ""Gotcha"" journalism that Cronkite would have abhorred. Taken all together, ""Pepper Dennis"" portrays its female journalist as a woman who wants it all, a career, a marriage, and a family, and fails miserably to successfully achieve any of it. The lesson here for aspiring female journalists: Women can't have it allfilm at eleven."

Disclaimers are alleged to function as a way to preserve both the current situation/conversation and the relationship including the identity of the individual using the disclaimer. This study focused on disclaimers and participants perceived appropriateness of disclaiming statements made by same sex friends. Statements including disclaimers made by a same sex friend were not perceived by participants as significantly more appropriate than statements without disclaimers. Additionally, interdependence did not significantly magnify the effect of disclaimers on judgments of appropriateness. None of the 5 types of disclaimers were perceived by participants as significantly more appropriate than others. Post hoc analyses revealed significant main effects for citizenship in the credentialing, sin licensing, and cognitive disclaimers scenarios, and significant main effects for independence in the hedging, credentialing, cognitive disclaimers, and appeals for suspension of judgment scenarios."

Who Sees What, When, How?",Measuring Reactions to Visuals,"In this paper three levels of visual communication analysis are combined: visual perception, meaning attribution and emotional reaction to press photography. Methodologically the paper uses an interdisciplinary approach, combining experimental media psychology (eyetracking, psychophysiological measurements) with visual content analysis (iconology). The experiments included perception measurement through eyetracking, interpretation measurement, (using a qualitative questionnaire which had to be filled in by the participants after the perception task,) and finally emotional reaction measurement, (using EMG and other psychophysiological methods to find out about emotional reactions to the selected press photographs). The purpose of the underlying research design is to measure the full visual communication process  from image perception (eyetracking  who sees what, when?), to attributing meaning to the images (iconology  what is the consciously given meaning of the images for different people? Is there an influence on what is perceived and how it is interpreted according to gender and/or to cultural background?) to measuring the emotional reactions to press photography (psychophysiological measurements while watching the images  what is the reaction to seeing the images? How does the meaning attribution relate to emotional reactions?).
The paper focuses on the methodological aspects of how to measure the perception, interpretation and emotional reaction to visual information presented in the format of still image press photography. It concludes with insights on how to generate convincing hypotheses, how to test for methodological compatibility, and how to synchronize the findings, ending with a preliminary answer to the question who sees what, when, how in press photography."

This paper establishes game addiction as a media process addiction with 4 unique factors: social ramifications of play, excessive play, uncontrollable play, and displacement. Addiction is found to be correlated with individuals perceptions of online games, as well as personality traits identified using the NEO-FFI scale. Implications for these results are discussed, as well as applications and recommendations for future research."

The focus groups employed continuous-response measures and instant-feedback technology to help guide discussion. Adolescents liked the technology employed. The results revealed that liking of messages did not ensure perceived effectiveness and that perceived effectiveness did not necessarily correspond to perceptions considered to be markers of actual effectiveness according to theories of information processing. The results suggest that researchers evaluating the impact of campaign messages need to incorporate theory-based measures of information processing and message interpretation processes rather than relying on broad measures of liking, effectiveness and believability."
2007-1103,Perceptions of Face and Realism in Interpersonal Conflict Scenarios,formation Systems Interactive High-Density: Systematic Examination of Communication Phenomenom,,,,Paper,Perceptions of Face and Realism in Interpersonal Conflict Scenarios,Information Systems Interactive High-Density: Systematic Examination of Communication Phenomenom,"Although most of the research on face has been concerned with building theory about intercultural conflict and discussing how it can be managed effectively in different social contexts, this concept may also be useful in understanding social judgments about characters in narratives. To date, no previous studies have addressed if and how face concerns and corresponding facework strategies are perceived in stories about conflict. Recent research on the psychology of narrative suggests that typical, familiar media stories are judged as more real than atypical, unfamiliar media stories. There is also evidence to suggest that narratives can capture cultural differences related to social identity. The present study manipulated the typicality of face concerns in conflict scenarios to examine Western perceptions of culturally congruent and incongruent face concerns in narratives. The results indicate that: 1) culturally congruent and incongruent face concerns can be differentiated by participants from a Western culture; and 2) by manipulating face concerns in conflict scenarios, we can also manipulate realism judgments about these scenarios. These findings are an initial step in understanding how cultural norms influence social judgments about face and perceptions of reality in interpersonal conflict scenarios. Further, this study contributes to a growing catalog of social judgments that influence realism in stories."

Based on the third-person effect hypothesis, the study predicts that respondents with higher levels of self-perceived individualism will be more likely to believe that the U.S. media affects others more than themselves. As expected, most respondents believed that the U.S media have negative effects on people in Malaysia and that others are more heavily influenced than the respondents themselves. This tendency was especially pronounced among those who consumed more U.S. videos and CNN. Individuals with higher levels of collectivism were less likely to exhibit third-person effects but more likely to support censorship of the U.S. media in Malaysia."

A survey revealed that participants with a collectivistic orientation tended to be more tolerant of mobile phone use in multi-focused settings, i.e., settings where individuals tend to do their own thing. In addition, individualism significantly predicted intolerance for use of the technology in fully-focused settings, i.e., those typically involving a collective level of engagement. The discussion offers theoretical insights and potential cross-cultural implications."

This is problematic because if one divorce has occurred, it is more likely that other divorces will follow (Amato, 1999; Anderson, Greene, Hetherington, & Clingempeel, 1999). Also, blended family research generally ignores the adult childs perspective concerning divorce. The current study examines how adult children of divorce perceive their own romantic relationships as a result of their parents divorce(s). The findings reveal that single-divorce participants (simple blended family) and multiple-divorce participants (complex blended family) perceive their romantic relationships in similar ways, however multiple-divorce participants are more likely to claim that they are hard on their romantic partners."

Beginning with Descartes' struggle with vision as epistemology, I extend his assumptions to contemporary discussions of performance and the Other in order to examine the role of the Zainichi Korean, an Other identified by no visual or performative cues."
2007-1108,"Performing Citizenship, Consuming Audiences: Reflections on Bridging Audience Studies, Cultural Citizenship, and Latina/o Studies",Emerging Directions in Latina/o Communication Studies,,,,Work in Progress,"Performing Citizenship, Consuming Audiences: Reflections on Bridging Audience Studies, Cultural Citizenship, and Latina/o Studies",Emerging Directions in Latina/o Communication Studies,"Audience studies and citizenship studies are often thought about as separate fields of inquiry located within different disciplines. Audience studies, usually situated within the interdisciplines of communications and cultural studies, focus on how media/popular culture audiences use and make-meaning of texts. Citizenship studies are most often situated within the social science disciplines of political science, sociology, and more recently anthropology with a focus on cultural citizenship. However, with the exception of the burgeoning work of Joke Hermes (2005), Toby Miller (1993, 1998), Vicki Mayer (2003) and Arlene Davila (2000, 2001), few scholars have attempted to examine the intersections between culture, audience, and citizenship. In this essay, I discuss the overlaps between these two bodies of literature and the ways in which a methodological focus on audience media ethnography can inform theories of cultural citizenship and vice versa. In particular, I explore what this kind of approach might mean for studying Latina/o audiences in particular. In doing so, I hope to provide a framework for a more broader, systemic understanding of the crossroads of culture, cultural products and practices, and cultural citizenship."

First, fathers positioned their identities within work-family rhythms across the lifespan through discourses sensitive to spatio-temporal considerations. Second, in doing their identity work, their marital or relational status with their childrens mother influenced their perceptions and enactment of agency in work-family negotiations. Finally, all performed their good father identities within considerations of their particular life circumstances, especially socioeconomic status. Despite these differences, when taken together these themes revealed that men construct fatherhoods around problem solving, role fulfillment assessments, and use of varied resources for fatherhood."

By identifying the unique ways in which the discourses of the four shows construct perceptions of national unity, solidarity, identity, and space, as well as abstract conceptions of individuality, social mobility, civic participation, and democracy, I attempt to examine the struggles, ruptures, and tensions that accompany processes of globalization and localization in concrete cultural practice. The analysis demonstrates that the construction of local national identity is extremely ambiguous, and often involves the simultaneous articulation of contrary elements both global and local, universalizing and particularizing. The roles of the various actors taking part in the strategic customization of shows to cater to what are perceived as local tastes are discussed."

2007-1112,Personal Involvement and Perception of Press Credibility,Examining Media Credibility,,,,Paper,Personal Involvement and Perception of Press Credibility,Examining Media Credibility,"Credibility of the press depends on public perception as well as its own performance. One of the factors that affect public perception of press credibility is personal involvement, which can be measured by membership of a particular group or personal stand on an issue. Using Singapore as an example, this study examined the impact of personal involvement on public perception of press credibility. Through a survey of 973 Singaporean adults, this study attempted to find out that if membership of ethnic and religious groups as well as personal stand on two public issues can affect individuals assessment of relevant news coverage. In addition, it examined how personal involvement influences peoples perceptions of press credibility in a broader sense by including accuracy and believability as other integral dimensions of the concept of credibility beyond fairness, which was often the sole criterion used in previous research. The results show that personal involvement does not necessarily always lead to the hostile media effect as found in earlier studies in the Western context. The differences are more likely to be the results of contextual factors rather than personal attributes of the audience."

Perceived characteristics of opinion leaders were also assessed to examine Brosius and Weimanns (1996) 2-step flow of agenda-setting. Analyses revealed that the TRA can be applied to accessing news media about a particular issue with the most important predictor of intent to access news media being normative beliefs. Implications for future research were discussed."

In the transition from the age of a collection of static Web pages into an era of social networking or peer-to-peer exchange communities, the mainstream discourses suggested that Web 2.0 further promoted decentralization and individual rights of expression. Under neoliberalism, individuals and natural resources were exploited by corporate power in order to maintain the legitimized claims of economic growth. The liberal view held that individual rights should be protected. The mainstream liberal discourses that the Internet is open for all and treats all equal. This report argues that the members of the social communities online became new form of labour power for today's corporate interests."

Taking advantage of the Internet, sales emails can now be presented in or supported by different kinds of new media such as digital graphics, animations, photos, videos, hypertexts, online games, etc. In sync with the globalization of business and the advancement of technology, understanding sales emails as a kind of persuasive communication supported by the Internet and new media is becoming increasingly important. The overall objective of this paper is to discuss an integrated analytical framework for studying sales emails. First, this paper addresses the importance of linking academic research with professional practices by studying a sales discourse with respect to a triangulation of e-marketers (the makers), sales emails (the objects), and consumers (the viewers). Second, it discusses the role of text, context, and interface in sales email study on the one hand, and the interplay of belief, interaction, and language in persuasive communication on the other."

We identified a unique segment of cigarette consumers, Phantom Smokers who do not view themselves as smokers, but still report smoking cigarettes. Using a sample of approximately 1,500 college students, this study empirically examines the concept of phantom smokers and captures their profile. About 16% of the respondents appeared to be phantom smokers and reported that they are not smokers even if they purchase cigarettes for themselves to smoke. The respondents in the phantom smoker group showed distinctiveness in the middle between smokers and nonsmokers along the continuum of attitudes toward smokers and smoking consequences. In addition, the phantom smoker group reported a smaller percentage of social circle who smoke than the respondents in the smoker group did but more than the respondents in the smoker group did. Finally, the practical implications of this new typology for antismoking message development are discussed."

The overarching goal of work on sojourner adaptation and intercultural communication competence is to help sojourners succeed in experiencing desirable outcomes and to help them avoid failure and the experience of undesirable outcomes."
2007-1118,Philosophical Writing and Reading After the Mediatic Turn,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,,,,Paper,Philosophical Writing and Reading After the Mediatic Turn,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,"In the last decade 'media philosophy' (Medienphilosophie) has entered the philosophical arena. According to its leading proponents this development not only, and not even in the first place, refers to the exploration of yet another ontological domain, but rather designates a fundamental transformation of philosophy itself, which is characterized by a turn towards (the descent and history of) the mediatic foundations of philosophy. I will elucidate the connected concept mediatic turn with reference to the Nachlass of Nietzsche on Wittgenstein. Their appeal to non-linguistic media such as music, film, pictures and diagrams, and even more so their continuous re-ordering of their database of aphorisms and fragments, disclose a hypermedial discourse that more adequately (than the classical monomedial and monolinear book) reflects the never-ending flux and changeability of the post-metaphysical world they evoke in their work. My aim will be to further investigate some of the possibilities and problems that are connected with this envisioned hyper-philosophy."
2007-1119,Philosophy of Language in Ancient China: A Brief Look at Laozis Ideas,Mapping Epistemological Terrains,,,,Paper,Philosophy of Language in Ancient China: A Brief Look at Laozis Ideas,Mapping Epistemological Terrains,"This paper discusses the philosophy of language proposed by ancient Chinese thinkers. Specifically, the paper focuses on Daoism, a special school of thought that was considered antilanguage (Hansen, 1992) because the confusing nature of language could not be solved if all discussion and debates are conducted in a language. Three philosophical schools that had developed explicitly ideas of language are discussed. First, a historical background of the School of Ming and Confucianism were discussed as two of the dominant ideas in the early development of Chinese language philosophy. Second, since this essay is to provide a different but saline view of language and language use in Chinese culture, Daoism is introduced as to point out the ambiguous nature of language and a worldview different from Ming or Confucianism. The author also hopes to introduce a philosophy of language different from traditional approach of rhetoric in communication studies."

Communities that focus on memory typically do so in transition from a horrific past to a future that remembers but seeks not to reproduce. Paul Ricoeur warns against excesses of memory which freezes communities in the past and inhibits their moving forward. Just as identity is used for political ends, everyday memories and written histories are used instrumentally to advance the political agendas of patriotism and nationalism. With regard to 9/11, one sees and hears the phrase I will never forget on bumper stickers and in commemorations, but to not forget is different from the production of excesses that demonize the Muslim Arab. This paper examines how such histories and memories are now being constructed relative to Arabs and Muslims in the United States and elsewhere."

The paper centers on analyses of the 'beheading' videos by Iraqi nationalist and terrorist groups, the Abu Ghraib torture images, and the rapidly growing phenomenon of active duty soldiers stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan posting their personal frontline stories and images - some extremely brutal
- on the Internet. Perpetrator images raise fundamental questions about the cameras role in acts of brutalizing and murdering. This paper offers a critical exploration of the psychological, political and moral implications of creating, and viewing, images of the suffering and death of others."

Past research has more focused on the difference in the effects of fear versus nonfear appeals. However, little research examined different types of appeals used within fear messages. This study compared physical threat and social threat used in these messages and how each type affects the television viewers cognitive and emotional processing of the messages. Differences between the 2 types of threat messages in the processing observed through the viewers physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance response and facial EMG) were reported in this study. Further, how females and males process these threat messages was also examined."

On the one hand, movie piracy decreases the legitimate sales because the pirated movie user may not watch a theatrical movie; on the other hand, however, piracy increases the legitimate sales of the movie product through the impact of network externalities and the diffusion of information. If the positive and negative impacts of piracy on the sales of movie products coexist at the same time, the overall impact of piracy on sales will depend on which impact is superior.
This paper tries to estimate the impact of movie piracy on the theatrical movie industry. In order to do this, a mathematical model was developed by modifying Hui and Pngs model for music piracy and, then, the overall impact of movie piracy on the theatrical movie industry estimate utilizing data on movie sales, admission price, video penetration, piracy rate of movies, and Internet penetration of 25 countries for 5 years through a two-stage least square model analysis. Each positive impact and negative impact of movie piracy on the theatrical movie industry is not estimated, however overall piracy impact resulting from the substitution between the negative and the positive impact of piracy is estimated. The results show that the overall impact of piracy is slightly positive. This implies the counterintuitive conclusion that theatrical movie sales have at least slight benefits from movie piracy."

Results confirm many of the conclusions from other studies of entertainment media outside of television: that public relations is still portrayed negatively; is only the realm of white, attractive people; has limiting roles for men and women; is not well defined, mostly as publicity and party planning; and looks easy and glamorous. New insights were gained into the portrayal of public relations on television including: the association of the term public relations with negative and silly actions, gender barriers, and a tendency to focus only on practice areas dealing with the rich and powerful elements of society such as entertainment and working for the White House."

We also examined the length of time participants reported competing in at least one sport and examined how or if this related to higher or lower body self-esteem. In this survey of 84 8-18-year-old female athletes, we found overall body self-esteem to be quite high, but found that athletes in specific sports (golf, volleyball, and soccer) were much more likely to have a more positive outlook on their body shape than athletes in other sports such as gymnastics. Thin-ideal television viewing was not related to body self-esteem at all; however, thin-ideal magazine reading was significantly related to lower body self-esteem. Participants who indicated the media were responsible for helping them become the girls they were today were much more likely to have lower body self-esteem than participants who felt parents or school were more influential. These and other findings are discussed."

New Perspectives on Motivations to Play Video Games,"The Sims is the best selling PC game ever. Its success contradicts the common stereotype about video games and its players. The Sims is a noncompetitive game with hardly any violence that attracts a far larger audience than the proverbial male adolescent. We investigated the player base of The Sims2, the most recent edition of The Sims that was released in 2004. The explorative study we report here is the first large-scale survey among players of The Sims2 (N = 760). Our results show that the common assertions about the large representation of women among Sims-gamers are true: 84% of our participants were female. We employed a uses and gratifications perspective to investigate why our participants liked to play The Sims2. Pastime was the most important motive, social interaction the least important. The gender differences we found were that men scored higher than women on the motives fantasy, challenge and social interaction. We also found that age was an important factor. Younger players expressed a stronger sense of empathy and identification with game characters than older players, and they scored higher on parasocial interaction."

Using examples of difference and similarity in young womens and mens visual self-representation, it will offer an interpretation of these practices pointing towards new visual conventions as well as references to preexisting media representations. The material shows that young people interact symbolically with the viewer/voter in accordance with references to media representations of ones gendered body (where femininity is communicated as body-ism and masculinity with facial prominence), while simultaneously constructing new forms of visual conventions, thus showing a process of hypervisuality. In this transforming process the involvement of new technologies such as web cameras, creates specific visual conventions within the frame of preexisting media imagery, when the self is ""put into practice"" online."

The analysis of interview data revealed contradictions in 2 central areas. First, NPs espouse a need for heightened autonomy in their working associations with medical doctors, while conversely MDs emphasize a need for ongoing connection. Secondly, MDs argue that NPs should be more proactive problem solvers and frame their working relationships as educational. But, NPs argue that MDs enact patterns of behavior that limit proactive problem solving and curtail the educational potential of their working relationships thus reinforcing predictable work routines. Both areas of contradiction constitute what dialectical theorist Leslie Baxter (1988) refers to as oppositions. Illustrative examples of these oppositions are provided in the analysis. The investigation concludes with an assessment of how such contradictions might constitute developmental opportunities for nurse practitioners and medical doctors who are working in collaboration."

However, even if the news coverage of election campaigns is important and has been at the centre of political communication research for a long time, there is still a lack of comparative studies in this area. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the election news coverage in Spain and Sweden. The study draws on the concept and theory of framing. By comparing the framing of politics in election news coverage in two vastly different democratic countries, the study will enable a deeper understanding of how the election news coverage is shaped by national media systems and political systems. The empirical method used is quantitative content analysis of the election news coverage in two newspapers in each country: El País and El Mundo in Spain, and Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet in Sweden. The time period includes the three weeks prior to the Swedish national election in 2002 and the Spanish national election in 2004. Differences and similarities found in the election news coverage are discussed in order to draw some conclusions, focusing on the importance of national media systems and political systems in understanding the election news coverage."

The consequences of this behavior, however, require additional investigation. Using data gathered from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, this study investigates the relationship between partisan selective exposure and political polarization. Peoples newspaper, talk radio, cable television news, and internet use are coded in order to construct measures of partisan selective exposure. Cross-sectional results show strong evidence that partisan selective exposure is related to holding polarized attitudes toward the candidates for the 2004 United States presidential election. Panel analyses and time series techniques are used to evaluate the causal direction of the relationship. Evidence consistently documents that partisan selective exposure leads to polarization. This study contributes to our understanding of the limitations of equating selective exposure with a limited effects tradition. Further, normative implications  both positive and negative  are discussed."

To examine this question, political ad tracking data were combined with a national daily survey collected during the 2000 election campaign cycle. The resulting ad volume data and individual communication behavior by geographic location and date allowed examination of how political advertising contexts influenced citizen communication. Results show that, in response to an influx of local political advertising, people sought more political information through television news programs, the Internet, and social networks. Theoretical and methodological implications of these findings are discussed."
2007-1132,"Political Ads, Communication Mediation, and Participation: Modeling Campaign Effects Across Generational Groups",Advertising,,,,Paper,"Political Ads, Communication Mediation, and Participation: Modeling Campaign Effects Across Generational Groups",Advertising,"In this paper, we contend that youth engagement  both in the form of civic behaviors such as volunteering and organizational memberships and more overtly political behaviors such as political expression and campaign participation  is critical to early adulthood socialization, and the accompanying responsibilities of citizenship (McLeod, 2000). However, we question whether media  television, campaign ads, and the Internet  are culprits reducing participation, contending instead that certain forms of mass media use may be agents of socialization into civic and political engagement. As a robust test of these relationships, we conducted two multimethod studies of campaign communication effects. Our studies merged campaign advertising placement and content data on a community-by-community basis during the 2000 and 2004 U.S. presidential election seasons with two national panel surveys conducted during these elections. We then run separate models of younger and older adults' civic and political participation during these two election seasons. Findings reveal that campaign effects on younger and older generations are mediated through information seeking and citizen expression about politics to encourage civic and political engagement."

The analysis is based on the three last elections (1997, 2001 and 2005) and offers a closer look at the development of party spots in the last decade. The study is divided into 5 parts. Firstly, the political background in Poland is outlined. Secondly, the author shows the increasing role of television during Polish parliamentary campaigns. Thirdly, the importance of party spots as a means of persuasive communication is addressed. Fourthly, design of the conducted analysis is briefly presented. Fifthly, party spots are analyzed. Using content analysis, the author shows how Polish parties change their commercials in mediated politics. The coding instrument measured the professionalization level, amount of negative attacks, intensity of personalization, and emotionalization level."
2007-1134,Political Communication Culture: Approaching Journalism From a Political Sociology Perspective,Political Culture and Journalism Culture: Theoretical Approaches,,,,Paper,Political Communication Culture: Approaching Journalism From a Political Sociology Perspective,Political Culture and Journalism Culture: Theoretical Approaches,"Why is the same political issue in one country discussed by the media as a serious political problem while it is ignored in the next country? How come that in advanced democracies we see large differences in processes and outcomes of political communication while macropolitical constrains such as globalisation would make us expect convergence? In order to come to grips with this question, it is not enough to offer institutional explanations of variations in media systems. Instead, as Blumler and Gurevitch point out, political communication ought to be conceived as interaction between journalists and political actors. This interaction is based on a specific set of orientations that guide the social behaviors of journalists and political actors. The paper aims at using the political culture approach of comparative political sociology to conceive of subjective orientations on which the politics-media interaction is based. Thus, the journalism culture is discussed as integral part of the political communication culture of a country. The paper highlights the theoretical implications of this conceptualisation and points to a set of hypotheses about types of political communication culture and the conditions in the media system which trigger them."

The following main questions are at stake: What are the main structural characteristics of political consulting in Switzerland? Who are the relevant suppliers? What are the services and activities in political consulting? Who are the clients and audiences? Empirical evidence regarding these structural characteristics will provide the basis for a discussion of their consequences for democracy, centering on the question whether political consulting promotes or impedes political participation and the equality of interest representation."

Whereas in some countries - such as the US, where there was a fierce debate on PC in the beginning of the 1990s  the political correctness controversy has faded (Tolmach Lakoff 2000: 117), in other countries  such as Belgium  PC it is still a controversial issue. This paper presents part of the results of a quantitative content analysis of newspaper articles referring to political correctness in (Dutch speaking) North Belgium. This is part of an ongoing PhD research project that analyzes discourses of political correctness in North Belgium from a discourse theoretical perspective.
In a first part, a short discursive history of political correctness is sketched. Then, the results of the quantitative mapping of different discourses on political correctness are presented. This mapping shows that in North Belgium political correctness is mainly related to multicultural society. This mapping also serves as the basis for the selection of cases that will be analyzed qualitatively in a next phase of the PhD research. In the last part of the paper some preliminary results of this discourses analysis will be presented. It will be argued that discourses of political correctness are more than just strategy. The political correctness controversy can give insight into the definition of democracy and free speech and the overall view on multicultural society of the different parties in the debate."

In this paper, and combining information obtained via interviews and analysis of data from BNF/BNT websites, I will examine the work of BNF and BNT within the context of two theoretical frameworks: (1) the coalition model of documentary film/video forwarded by Whiteman (2004); and, (2), the horizontal networking logic facilitated by new digital technologies (Juris, 2005) in relation to grassroots political action. The primary purpose of the paper is to understand and analyze the degree to which BNF/BNT employs a coalition model approach (in which filmmakers, film subjects, film screeners, audiences and political organizers cooperate in order to increase the efficacy of grassroots political action) to documentary/activist film, and the extent to which digital technology (particularly the internet) facilitates such an approach. This study will create a greater understanding of how certain forms of political communication (e.g. documentary films) can bypass traditional media gatekeepers (such as film distributors and film theater owners) while still reaching large numbers of viewers, and contributing to grassroots political action."
2007-1138,"Political Engagement, Community Engagement, and Discursive Participation Across the Lifespan",Youth in the Life Course,,,,Paper,"Political Engagement, Community Engagement, and Discursive Participation Across the Lifespan",Youth in the Life Course,"Political theories almost universally assert that citizen engagement with politics and community are essential attributes of a democratic society. Some previous research has examined predictors of engagement, but little consensus exists on what a model of engagement should look like. In the present paper, we use data from a probability-sampled survey to build predictive models of engagement. We then ask whether these models differ across the lifespan. That is, do different predictors matter for younger persons than matter for older persons - perhaps suggesting different points of intervention for increasing engagement? Our models are in general consistent with past research and largely suggest that those factors that predict engagement are the same whether one is young or old."
2007-1139,Political-Entertainment Television as Object of Study: The Challenge of Inscribing Hybridity,Methodological Challenges in the Study of Hybrid Political-Entertainment Television,,,,Paper,Political-Entertainment Television as Object of Study: The Challenge of Inscribing Hybridity,Methodological Challenges in the Study of Hybrid Political-Entertainment Television,"All scholarly investigation begins by defining its object of study: by carving out boundaries that allow the researcher to identify, count, analyze, or otherwise work with some aspect of the real. Hybrid political television, however, poses a complex set of challenges that complicate this first step in the research process. Before one can begin to consider its significance, one first must be able to say what it is (and what it is not). This paper considers the difficulties in defining a singular object of study from within a phenomenon marked by the permeability of form and the fluidity of content. It explores the challenges in distinguishing boundaries between news and non-news and around a genre shaped by multiple articulations of topic, style, and patterns of language use within individual shows and across various program types. It concludes by considering the implications of hybridity for subsequent methodological practice."

It is argued that these incitement cases required the involvement of the legal authorities, but not enough action was taken in order to prevent them or to punish the inciters. The media provided large platforms for the inciters, serving and promoting their partisan, hateful interests."
2007-1141,Political Trust and the Implications of Context on Audience Readings of Televised Political Content,News Audiences,,,,Extended Abstract,Political Trust and the Implications of Context on Audience Readings of Televised Political Content,News Audiences,"Quantitative approaches to media effects have produced ambiguous results when examining political trust and the consumption of televised political information. In this paper, we argue that there indeed is a relationship between political trust and consumption of televised political information, but one that varies according to the contextual conditions of the audience. Based on our qualitative examination of young Mexicans political attitudes and television use patterns, we propose that the role of television is like a resonating chamber that strengthens dominant attitudes towards politics, whether they be trustful or distrustful. This is the outcome of the coincidence of two aspects that define the consumption of information. First, the way political information is read. In the Mexican case, all political mediated content is filtered through the low levels of trust on politics, institutions and politicians, generating a negative and pessimistic reading of the information. Second, the way TV is perceived as a source of political information. Again in the Mexican case, mediated political content is perceived as extremely sensationalist, shallow, biased and manipulated either by the political or the commercial interests of the media outlets. Mexicans then discard as untrustworthy information that which conflicts with previously held attitudes. Both processes coincide and the result is that in this new democracy, television, though not being the original source of political dissatisfaction, becomes a resonating chamber that strengthens dissatisfaction with politics over time, generating a cycle of distrust. We urge researchers to consider more comparative research in order to explore how audience context affects televisions influence."

This could have a possible explanation: we could simply think that instead of looking for the public good, journalists are busy looking for profitable news in order to stay competitive, probably meaning breaking news and scandals to bring the most possible audience. In short, stories about politicians private lives constitute the kind of news that sells. This paper addresses three questions: What does profitable news mean for journalists, How do mass media manage them and what does this reflect about our society? On the one hand I will explain what profitable news means to the journalists under two different environments France and United States- over the last 10 years. On the other hand I will analyze how that news has been treated and how the media treatment of that news has been managed. This study draws upon news content analysis, interviews with journalists, and focus groups with readers."
2007-1143,"Polls, Coalition Signals, and Strategic Voting: An Experimental Investigation of Perceptions and Effects",Voters & Voting,,,,Paper,"Polls, Coalition Signals, and Strategic Voting: An Experimental Investigation of Perceptions and Effects",Voters & Voting,"The paper investigates the factors that affect voters attention to and perception of preelection polls and coalition signals by parties. In a second step, the effect of polls and coalition signals on strategic voting is tested. Close elections are assumed to lead some voters to depart the most-preferred party to vote for a party with better electoral chances. The study uses an innovative design that embeds a laboratory experiment in a real election campaign, allowing the manipulation of polls and coalition signals in a realistic environment. The findings suggest that political sophistication plays a crucial role for the accurate perception of polls and strategic voting. Coalition signals are found to play a surprisingly strong role for (apparently) strategic voting."
2007-1144,Pornography in Second Life: Male Dominance and a Developing Female Voice,Caught in the Net: Gender Identity Online,,,,Paper,Pornography in Second Life: Male Dominance and a Developing Female Voice,Caught in the Net: Gender Identity Online,"Studies that examine online pornography reveal that the Internet seems to reproduce the existing gender power structures. This study investigates whether the pornography representations in a 3-D online game Second Life reinforce male dominant view over the female sexuality. Using textual analysis and a feminist theoretical framework, this study finds that gender representation in two Second Life pornography publications-Players magazine and Second Life Escorts-is a mixed picture. Second Lifes technological flexibility in gender representation does not result in a new type of pornography content. Male domination and female submission are still main themes in gender discourse. However, a developing female voice is found in female players engagement in self-representations of sexuality, resistance to the male defined standard of female beauty, and expression of female sexual pleasure. Further, this study investigates the game economy of Second Life and finds the male dominance in pornography representation as an outcome of market-driven sex industry in Second Life, which at the meanwhile limits female perspectives in pornographic content."

Times picture packages rely on certain familiar stereotypes or myths in American culture in order to favorably portray U.S. involvement. Those stereotypes include 2 primary mythical themes: U.S. military casualties as heroes overcoming injuries and as innocent heroes sacrificed for their people. The secondary themes include ordinary and good guys, the supremacy of the U.S. military medical technology, and the humanitarian goals of the United States. Thus, Times photographs, relying as they do on mythical narratives and avoiding divergent subject matter, could steer readers toward a constructed reality of the war, while preventing readers from a more complete understanding of the wars first year."
2007-1146,Power Feminism in Communication: An Invitation to Consider the Stakes,Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Power Feminism in Communication: An Invitation to Consider the Stakes,Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,"This paper was spawned by an experience at a pre-conference called Interrogating Feminism in 2005. In that pre-conference, the author was introduced to several power feminists in the field of communication. Power feminism is a position that argues that women need to stop being victims and embrace their power. The author was troubled by this position, and yet wanted to avoid creating divisions with other feminists. This paper thus uses invitational rhetoric to construct a picture of what power feminism is, to suggest times when it is useful, and to highlight times when power feminism is a dangerous political position. This paper functions as an offering to power feminists in the hopes to engage in a dialogue about the stakes of feminist politics in communication studies and elsewhere."

2007-1148,Practical Theory in Applied Communication Research: Three Normative Models,Refining Communication Theory,,,,Paper,Practical Theory in Applied Communication Research: Three Normative Models,Refining Communication Theory,"Grounded in Lewins notion that there is nothing so practical as a good theory, applied communication scholars have been encouraged over the last 25 years to address practical problems and to do so in ways that simultaneously test or develop theoretically-informed interventions to solve problems and contribute to theory building. With this growing emphasis on the role of theory in applied communication research, traditional concepts of social science theory have also been questioned. Scholars have proposed various new forms of theory or theorizing practices intended to be more useful or practical than traditional theory; however, no consensus has emerged on how to make theories of communication more practical. This paper shows how recent metatheoretical work on the concept of practical theory offers several alternative ways for applied communication scholars and practitioners to address practical problems and also build useful theory. Elaborating and applying Barges distinctions among practical theory as mapping, engaged reflection, and transformative practice, we examine the concepts, assumptions, and methods of each approach as they are lived out in recent theory and research conducted by applied communication scholars. Theory already is widely used for practical purposes in applied research. The contribution of explicit practical theory approaches, as we show, is to provide normative models and exemplary lines of work that can be used to articulate, critique, and further advance already existing practical tendencies in the use of theory in applied communication scholarship. We conclude with a consideration of issues affecting the future development of practical theory in applied communication scholarship."
2007-1149,Practicing What We Preach: Enhancing Academic Dialogue to Transcend International Barriers,How Global is the Communication Research Community?,,,,Paper,Practicing What We Preach: Enhancing Academic Dialogue to Transcend International Barriers,How Global is the Communication Research Community?,"Globalization and rapid technological change are interrelated processes wielding significant influence over international political, economic and cultural relations in the early 21st century. The pace and depth of change place greater responsibility on researchers to investigate cross-cultural and/or transnational aspects of their specializations, and requires that graduate-level instructors prepare future academicians to recognize and pursue such connections. This paper advocates more sustained interaction by U.S. scholars and graduate students with their counterparts in developing nations in order to clarify--and challenge--the barriers that separate us. Numerous small-scale projects have yielded admirable results, yet the benefits need to spread among larger numbers of teachers, researchers and students. The paper discusses specific on-campus initiatives to increase student awareness of and commitment to intercultural issues as well as efforts to promote international contact through faculty and graduate student travel and exchange programs, study abroad, transnational teleconferencing, and cross-national collaborative research projects. Although many university mission statements emphasize international research and educationas do the personal or professional goals of many facultytoo often we fall short as institutions and individuals in acting to achieve them."

Based on a comparative study of the two largest SFU Internet fan forums, I argue that the fans who post on Television Without Pity display higher levels of linguistic resources and draw more regularly on discourses of aesthetics to critique the show than those fans who post on the HBO forums. However, both groups had powerful investments in what Jenkins (1992) refers to as emotional realism. Thus the appeal of a quality television series like SFU is predicated upon complex and contradictory interpretative practices."

One hundred and six 10  13 year old pre-teens identified their favorite television characters and responded to questions about their parasocial interaction, identification, and wishful identification with these characters, as these variables have been found to mediate a variety of outcomes associated with media exposure. Additional variables assessed include the extent of gender stereotype endorsement, overall media exposure, as well as specific behaviors associated with their television exposure (e.g., parental regulation of television use, co-viewing patterns). Findings are discussed in light of theoretical perspectives on the medias contribution to stereotype development and research on viewer effects."
2007-1152,Predicting Children's Media Use: Within Time vs. Over Time Differences,The Uses and Effects of Media Among Children,,,,Paper,Predicting Children's Media Use: Within Time vs. Over Time Differences,The Uses and Effects of Media Among Children,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the predictors of childrens media use within time and over time. Data come from waves 1 and 2 of the Child Development Supplement (CDS-I; CDS-II), a nationally representative sample of children ages 0-12 in 1997 and 5-18 in 2002. 24-hour time use diaries are used to assess childrens time spent with media (television, video games, computer, and reading). Predictors examined include child characteristics, socioeconomic context, neighborhood quality, the family context in which children live. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Multiple Regression is used. Socioeconomic context is significant to predict video games and computer use. Neighborhood quality is a significant factor to predict media use of children in early school age within time and over time. While parent limit setting has relationships with media within time, family conflict was associated with media use over time. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence for the effect of early contextual factors on the life course of childrens media use."

IIs have been examined in America. This study examined the functions of IIs impacting intrapersonal communication satisfaction and measures of cultural patterns in America, Japan, and Thailand. Horizontal individualism is a cultural pattern in which the self is independent but is equal in status with others. Vertical individualism is a pattern characterized by an autonomous self but there are differences in authority, based on status, low equality, and high freedom. Horizontal collectivism is a pattern in which the self is seen as equal in status with others. Vertical collectivism is a pattern characterized by the self being connected with other group members and inequality is accepted. Results revealed that intrapersonal communication satisfaction was predicted by imagined interactions that serve a self-understanding, catharsis, and boldness function. Horizontal collectivism also predicted communication satisfaction for Thai participants. Results are discussed in terms of the importance and functions of conflict-linkage and rumination."

Building from the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), a theroetical model predicing self-protection of online privacy was proposed and tested in the present study. The results of formal model testing using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) showed that attitudes, subjective norms, level of perceived behavioral control, and past behavior accounted for 46% of the variability in participants intention to adopt online privacy protection strategies and 28% of the variability in actual adoption during a ten-day period immediately after participants completed the initial questionnaire. Additionally, individuals psychological need for privacy was found to be an important source of influence on the attitude component of the planned behavior model. General self-efficacy was an important predictor of perceived behavioral control. Overall, the present research provided a strong support for the theoretical utility of psychological factors and processes in online privacy related research."
2007-1155,Predictors of Online Cancer Information Seeking Behaviors Among Rural Breast Cancer Patients,Cancer Information Seeking,,,,Paper,Predictors of Online Cancer Information Seeking Behaviors Among Rural Breast Cancer Patients,Cancer Information Seeking,"There has been very little research examining the personal characteristics that predict who is most likely to seek online breast cancer information, the form they seek it in and the topics they seek out when living with a cancer diagnoses and subsequent treatments. This current study employs the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) model as a conceptual framework to better understand what psychosocial characteristics predict online cancer-related information seeking for rural breast cancer patients, which is an important population to study because they typically have fewer healthcare providers and limited local information resources and community support services. Examining a group of 144 rural breast cancer patients who were provided free computer hardware, Internet access and training how to use an Interactive Cancer Communication System, this study correlated pretest survey scores indicating patients psychosocial status with specific online cancer information seeking behaviors. Results indicated that many of the factors specified by the C-SHIP model can successfully predict online cancer information seeking behaviors among rural breast cancer patients. This supports the applicability of the model not only to self-protective behavior for preventing cancer but also to discerning the reasons why people already afflicted with cancer may seek information to cope with their disease. These results further suggest that cancer patients may seek out information as a compensatory coping mechanism; that is, those who were in a worse condition regarding their competencies and well-being were generally more likely to seek out more online cancer information."

In addition, psychological variables that are hypothesized to be correlated with presence -- attention, memory, valence, and arousal  were also measured. Specifically, a 2 (Mobile versus Room environment) x 2 (Low audio quality versus High audio quality) x 2 (Singapore Standard English versus Colloquial Singapore English) fully-crossed factorial design was employed. Two hundred and eighty three university students, 183 female and 100 male, participated in the study. Generally, the results of this study provide strong support only for the effects of listening environment on presence. Except for memory, all the psychological variables were positively correlated with presence. The implications of the findings for presence theory and portable media technologies are discussed."

Though the role of news media in democratization has been widely acknowledged, little research has yet explored the interplay between different influences on media systems and levels of democracy. This study uses the Freedom House scale, which rates countries on legal, political, and economic aspects of press freedom, and compares successful with incomplete transitions, and with nontransition countries, in seven regions. The results suggest that, although all three dimensions are significant, legal and economic factors are most influential on the successful outcomes of transitions, with political factors more influential on the amount of democratic change."
2007-1159,Primary and Secondary Goals in Supportive Communication,trategic Communication in Marital and Romantic Relationships,,,,Paper,Primary and Secondary Goals in Supportive Communication,Strategic Communication in Marital and Romantic Relationships,"Supportive communication is essential for people coping with everyday stresses and crises. However, people do not always perceive support as helpful or appropriate. Communication researchers apply different perspectives to explain why well-intended support may not be helpful. Current theoretical frameworks are politeness theory, constructivism (person-centeredness), and goal-matching theory. This study serves as a preliminary step toward extending knowledge by applying the Dillards (1990) goal-planning-action model. The researchers attempted to explain comforting messages as a multiple goal achievement to illustrate the influences of primary and secondary goals on the production of comforting. Possibly, difficulty in supportive contexts may arise from attempting to achieve multiple goals, and sometimes these goals are competing --- to provide helpful advice and to avoid threats to the recipients self-esteem and autonomy that result from receiving help. The main purpose of this study was to answer 2 research questions of what primary and secondary goals are in supportive communication. Based on Study 1 (N = 183) and Study 2 (N = 207), the findings revealed a typology of support goals. Five goals emerged as primary and secondary goals in comforting the person experiencing relational breakup. The primary goals are: to assure of availability for help, to divert attention, and to maintain the relationship (with the distressed person). The secondary goals include to console religiously and to maintain the relationship (with the ex-partner)."

This study investigated the possible effects of cultivation and mainstreaming on environmental risk perceptions by introducing new variables measuring the diversity of television content viewed and the individual uses and gratifications underlying television viewing. Using the national Life Style Study survey data set, hierarchical OLS regression suggests that individuals that watch television to fulfill a preexisting need and those who watch for informational purposes are more likely to be concerned about environmental risks that other groups. Likewise, individuals with a larger diversity of content, particularly informative content, also exhibit greater concerns about environmental risks."
2007-1161,Private Speech: Semiotic Mediation of Agency in Literacy Learning Activities,tructional & Developmental Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Private Speech: Semiotic Mediation of Agency in Literacy Learning Activities,Instructional & Developmental Communication Interactive Paper Session,"This discourse analytic study examined the interrelationship between 4 first-grade childrens private speech and their participation in literacy learning. We documented how thinking practices for literacy knowledge production modeled by a classroom teacher influenced private utterances over an academic year. Private speech usage was related to the increasing difficulty of assigned tasks and to instruction in self-regulation. Childrens self talk, however, was neither completely private nor simply an internalization of instruction in self-regulation strategies. Rather, it was a linguistic form of mediation that was inherently connected to this community of practice with its specific expectations for how to be a responsible member. As such, a part of using private speech entailed children leaning how to interpret and respond to literacy problems in the right or locally accepted way. This accepted way required students to have an understanding of their social relationship (roles and responsibilities) with others in knowledge production as well as an understanding of how, when, and under what circumstances to use tools and strategies for learning. Private speech sustained and used in this community was responsive to both the local demands of a particular situation and the communitys ways of defining how a task must be done and how mistakes should be corrected, i.e., the practical-moral knowledge of the community. As a consequence private and social speech were woven into the fabric of learning activities and became the means by which young childrens embodied agency as knowledge producers was practiced and developed over the academic year."
2007-1162,Problem Behavior Syndrome: An Examination of Disordered Eating as Risk Taking Behavior,Tests of the Risk Perception Attitude Framework and Problem Behavior Theory,,,,Paper,Problem Behavior Syndrome: An Examination of Disordered Eating as Risk Taking Behavior,Tests of the Risk Perception Attitude Framework and Problem Behavior Theory,"In this study we explored the relationship between risk-taking behavior, including disordered eating, and the meanings that individuals assign to those behaviors in a sample of incoming college freshmen. The overall goal of this research is to extend research in problem behavior theory by not only looking at the cooccurrence of problem behaviors, but to determine whether common symbolic meanings are associated across those correlations. Overall, there were 2 distinct factors of risk taking. The first included smoking, alcohol use, marijuana use, drinking and driving, and risky sex. The second included use of diet pills, amphetamines and other drugs, and dieting to lose weight. We also examined the meanings that individuals associate with risk taking as it related to their own risk taking. Overall, 2 roots emerged: pleasers and independents. The former included more risk taking, such as smoking, drinking, binge drinking, marijuana use, sex without condoms, restricting food, purging (via vomiting or laxatives) and taking diet pills. In addition to these risks, these individuals believed that those who fasted are independent, those who engaged in the risky weight loss behaviors are relaxed, care what others think and get credit for their actions. This pattern suggests people who believe in the social benefits of risk taking. The latter root includes nonsmokers who drink, but do not binge drink. They are nondieters who believe that high risk dieters are independent. This pattern suggests individuals who admire independent behavior."

The first part analyzes Public Relations in contemporary times, under two dimensions: as a Professional practice and as an academic field of studies. From an international perspective, some relevant aspects of the evolution of the practice of Public Relations in organizations are outlined and the main contemporary Public Relations theories are broadly presented. The second part situates the same kind of study in the Brazilian life context, outlining the evolution of this field in the country and its similarities with Organizational Communication. The institutionalization of the academic education and graduate programs in the Communication field is described and an analytical study of the scientific production in the fields of Public Relations and Organizational Communication published in the country from 1970 to 2005 is presented."

This research considers one of the most recent ways citizens are able to enter into political conversations on the Internetthrough video-sharing websites. Specifically this paper uses qualitative methods to identify genres of political videos on YouTube. The second stage of the research turns to quantitative methods to illustrate how political bloggers link to and essentially use YouTube as part of its political discourse. The research shows that bloggers still tend to link to content produced mainly by mainstream media. That said, the research offers new ways to think about citizens as gatekeepers of online poltiical content."

The LGBT rights movement groups have been trying to cooperate with mass media to raise awareness of issues affecting homosexuals and to stimulate gay-straight communication. THA (The Tongzhi Hotline Association) is the LGBT rights movement group in this case study, and the group has been managing to attract media coverage of the LGBT rights movement events. In the case of Taiwan Pride Parade (September 30, 2006), THA had expected much in media coverage. This research also constructs a competitive symbiotic model to access the process and result of LGBT rights movement groups employment of media strategies in competition with the authorities over the news coverage of this parade. The case shows they believed that concerns of gays and lesbians were topics of interest to the mainstream media, and so they devoted maximum resources to media outreach. For news coverage and public attention, movement organizers have to be more aware of the function of mainstream media to shape a powerful message and of the necessity for a movement to launch significant events to forward their message. This model also highlights the reflexivity and agency of the LGBT rights activists, which accordingly leads to dynamics, nonlinear and nondeterministic assessment of the contests in the news media."

2007-1167,Prosociality Versus Selfishness: A New Perspective on Brain Lateralization and Communication.,arch of the Right Mind: Left- and Right-Hemisphere Bases of Communication,,,,Paper,Prosociality Versus Selfishness: A New Perspective on Brain Lateralization and Communication.,In Search of the Right Mind: Left- and Right-Hemisphere Bases of Communication,"A selfish-prosocial distinction allows a new approach to the question of right-hemisphere (RH) and left-hemisphere (LH) responding in communication. The LH is associated with language in most persons, while the RH plays a special role in emotion. Some support a right-hemisphere hypothesis, that the RH is associated with the expression and communication of all emotions. Others favor instead the valence hypothesis, that the LH is associated with ""positive"" and the RH with ""negative"" emotions. We suggest that the ""positive-negative"" distinction be replaced by a ""prosocial-selfish"" distinction, so that the LH is prosocial and the RH is selfish. A study of fMRI response to dynamic and spontaneous expressions of persons to photographs of familiar persons versus unpleasant scenes showed that, as expected, the left amygdala region was activated to the depiction of the prosocial expression and the right amygdala was activated to the depiction of the negative expression."

Drawing on work exploring the political and media spectacles, this study suggests that young people are not cynical, passive political agents. In the end, I argue instead that young adults have adopted a critical attitude from their consumption of mediated popular culture and that this stance has been carried over into the political world where young people have learned to be protective critics."
2007-1169,Prototype Analysis of Relational Maintenance Behaviors,trategic Communication in Marital and Romantic Relationships,,,,Paper,Prototype Analysis of Relational Maintenance Behaviors,Strategic Communication in Marital and Romantic Relationships,"Numerous relational maintenance behaviors have been identified in the interpersonal communication and relational literature. A major focus has been the exploration of the association between these behaviors and relational qualities such as satisfaction. However, theoretical consideration as to why some behaviors are more predictive of relational characteristics than others is absent. The current project utilizes prototype theory as a potential framework for understanding the varying predictive ability of relational maintenance behaviors. We report 4 studies (with a total N = 1,110 of married adults and students) identifying and verifying relational maintenance prototypes. Nine prototypical maintenance behaviors were found to account for 55% of the variance in relational satisfaction. Directions for the development of a revised parsimonious measure of relational maintenance based on prototype theory are offered."

Participants played two different digital games against a co-located and a non co-located opponent. Zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi electromyographic (EMG) activity, skin conductance level (SCL), and cardiac interbeat intervals were recorded, and the participants rated their personality (sociability, aggressiveness, and dispositional behavioral activation system [BAS] and behavioral inhibition system [BIS] sensitivities). In both the co-located and non co-located conditions, emotional arousal and positively valenced emotional responses increased in the order of playing against a computer < playing against a stranger < playing against a friend. This effect was dependent on the players personality, e.g., playing against a friend elicited particularly positive emotional responses only among low aggressive players."

Based on the result, it is revealed that nation-states economic scale and level of social freedom are significant determinants of their level of Web public diplomacy interactivity, whereas their political system is not. Implications and suggestions for future studies are presented as well."

First, this study examines how news coverage and favorable news influence corporate sales/revenue. Then, it explores that corporate reputation positively moderates the impact of both news coverage and favorable news on corporate sales/revenue after controlling for firm size and the lagged dependent variable. The findings of this study provide considerable support for the impact of corporate reputation in enhancing corporate sales/revenue."

After observing a differential pattern in public attitudes in Belgium towards biomedical and agricultural biotechnology as well as reproductive cloning, it is ascertained whether this situation is reflected in the coverage from 2000 to 2004 in three popular newspapers. To this end a conventional content analysis of the newspaper articles has been conducted in combination with an open metaphor analysis. Parallels as well as divergences have emerged between public perceptions and popular reporting on biotechnology and the use of metaphors was found to play an important role."
2007-1174,Public Relations as Conscience: Practitioner Involvement in Organizational Value Setting,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Public Relations as Conscience: Practitioner Involvement in Organizational Value Setting,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,"Public relations scholars have often ascribed the organizational conscience role to public relations practitioners. At the same time, public relations scholars have also been ascribed the role of cocreators of culture. And yet, while both conscience and culture are informed by values, none have examined how practitioners are involved in organizational value setting. This paper examines the organizational conscience role by focusing on public relations practitioners involvement in organizational value setting. To address this aim, this paper examines the current literature on public relations as conscience roles, public relations as cocreators of culture, and the value-setting process. The paper then presents and discusses the results of interviews undertaken with Australian public relations and communication practitioners on their involvement in the organizational value-setting process."

At the same time,public relations has developed at an extraordinary pace. It is being transformed by such factors as education, escalating management expectations, professional societies, economic privatization, consumer demand, grassroots activism, increasingly powerful NGOs, and communication technologies. The new communication managers are helping their organizations anticipate societal transformation and actually leading them through change and the resulting chaos."

This article focuses on the relation between public relations and coverage patterns in the press, and examines whether media coverage of locations with similar characteristics is influenced by the systematic use of public relations. Israel provides a unique opportunity to examine this relation, due to the existence of three towns with extremely similar characteristics (population, ethnic origin of the population, employment levels, location, and year of establishment), that during the time of this study differed only in their use of public relations. Examining the relation between the use of public relations and media coverage was accomplished using a variety of research methods, including quantitative and qualitative content analysis and in-depth interviews. In examining the relation between public relations and media coverage patterns of locations, we rely on the social construction of reality theoretical paradigm."

2007-1180,Public Relations Models and Persuasion Ethics: Is Fear of Persuasion an Obstacle to Ethics?,Developments in Public Relations Theory Building II,,,,Paper,Public Relations Models and Persuasion Ethics: Is Fear of Persuasion an Obstacle to Ethics?,Developments in Public Relations Theory Building II,"The paper proposes that there are three main obstacles to constructing a coherent ethical framework for public relations:

1) the marginalization of persuasion in the dominant approaches to public relations theory;
2) the varying attitudes to persuasion in competing models of public relations; and
3) the varying ethical assumptions in each model.

This paper compares approaches to propaganda and persuasion from public relations scholars and from other disciplines and suggests that definitions do not help distinguish these aspects of communication. It then compares the attitudes to persuasion and to persuasion ethics taken by the main models of public relations: boundary spanner, advocate, relationship manager, and  from the critics  propagandist. Finally it offers a model and some concepts from social psychology that could be adapted to map the interaction of organizational communication with its many publics from an ethical perspective."
2007-1181,Public Silence and Private Loudness: Effect of Communicative Efficacy on Willingness to Speak,Citizen Participation and Discussion,,,,Paper,Public Silence and Private Loudness: Effect of Communicative Efficacy on Willingness to Speak,Citizen Participation and Discussion,"Quantitative researches on public opinion have been concerned about publicly expressed opinion in general, and opinion that does not appear in public space has been regarded as silence. However, people often speak out actively in private places even though they do not express their opinion in public. We assumed that willingness to speak will be higher in private situation than in public situation, and communicative efficacy will be the intermediating variable in that process. Undergraduate students participated in the survey to test the relation between publicness of speaking situation, communicative efficacy, and willingness to speak. The results show that higher publicness decreases communicative efficacy and communicative efficacy is the key factor determining willingness to speak. Findings and implications from the result were discussed."

Learning to use blogs (""web logs,"" web pages that are regularly updated with links and opinion), wikis (web pages that non-programmers can edit easily), podcasts (digital radio productions distributed through the Internet), and digital video as media of self-expression, with an emphasis on ""public voice,"" should be considered an important component of 21st century civic curriculum. Participatory media that enable young people to create as well as consume media are popular among high school and college students. Many youth teach themselves and each other to use new media production and distribution tools. However, introducing the use of these media in the context of the public sphere that undergirds democracy is an appropriate intervention for educators. The participatory characteristics of online digital media are described in this chapter, the connection between individual expression and public opinion is discussed, case histories and background research are briefly noted, and specific exercises for developing a public voice through blogs, wikis, and podcasts, are suggested. A companion wiki provides an open-ended collection of resources for educators."
2007-1183,Queer Realism on YouTube,Documenting Our Perverts: Queerness and Realism in Documentary From the 1960s to the 21st Century,,,,Paper,Queer Realism on YouTube,Documenting Our Perverts: Queerness and Realism in Documentary From the 1960s to the 21st Century,"A cursory set of searches for queer content on YouTube brings up realist images of sincere queer youth coming out to a camera in their bedroom, boys terrorizing each other with gay kisses in suburban game rooms, and the predictably scripted but avowedly real kisses of hot, blond chicks. The banality of this revolution is as notable as its unrestricted access. In the late-80s, when I theorized the uses of realist practices by committed producers of AIDS activist video, my project was to illuminate the sophistication and purpose behind a set of tactical, formal choices. As access to media production and dissemination has democratized in ways unimaginable during the camcorder revolution it is less clear to me whether the critical, political and historical framework that provided the infrastructure for committed media production has also traveled to these multiple and expanded audiences and producers. In this paper, I will trouble the effects of a queer realist YouTube practice as indebted to reality TV as it is to queer liberation documentary."
2007-1184,"Queer Tales of Morality: The Press, Gay Marriage, and Hegemonic Framing",News Media and Queer Politics,,,,Paper,"Queer Tales of Morality: The Press, Gay Marriage, and Hegemonic Framing",News Media and Queer Politics,"The purpose of our study is to examine press coverage of gay marriage, assessing the extent to which framing was consistent with one side of the debate or the other. We further situate our research within the cultural context by drawing upon a host of macrolevel predictor variables. With the foundation of framing and hegemony theories, we quantitatively content analyze stories from daily papers and wire services, and qualitatively examine the text of stories published in the states with antigay-marriage ballot initiatives. The latter provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological characterization of marriage within this context. Our findings reveal that although gay marriage friendly frames appear more often than traditional marriage frames, it is the latter that set the parameters of the debate. The paper concludes that the coverage does little to challenge dominant hegemonic definitions of marriage."

Tarantinos selective lack of forthrightness about his sources of inspiration and his willingness to indulge in or allow obfuscation about the origins of many of the film projects he is involved in point towards his complicity in long-standing issues of appropriation. An examination of the ways in which Tarantino engages in the obfuscation and concealment of significant aspects of films that he is involved with will shed light on the ways in which he is complicit with an appropriative framework. This is significant because of the function of appropriation in and around Whiteness. Tarantino serves as a case study in Whiteness because of his words, his actions, and his beliefs. These are examined in detail and the implications are discussed."

Reflexive questions, in particular, offer options for parties to stand back and take stock of the direction that conversations are taking. This paper will explore the question-answer process that opens up and closes off dialogue in conflict situations. In particular, it will center on circular questions, reframing questions, the naming ability of questions, and questions that shift levels of abstraction to explore their role in co-constructing new meanings and shifting the nature of a dispute.

Using data from teacher-management negotiations, this paper will isolate and analyze the question-answer process as a key element in conflict management. In particular, it will center on episodes of interaction in which disputants altered or transformed their naming of what a conflict was about. Then it will focus on the syntax, type, context, and evolution of the question-answers as texts for unpacking the co-creating processes and evolution of joint ownership in an evolving dispute."
2007-1187,Questioning Cultural and Individual Memory: Constructing Narrative History Through Interviews with Family Members and Holocaust Survivors,Questions and Questioning: A Focal Practice for Constructing Selves and Social Scenes,,,,Paper,Questioning Cultural and Individual Memory: Constructing Narrative History Through Interviews with Family Members and Holocaust Survivors,Questions and Questioning: A Focal Practice for Constructing Selves and Social Scenes,"The Transcending Trauma Project* has examined coping and adaptation in Holocaust survivors and their families. The project has conducted 275 in depth life histories of survivors, their children, and grandchildren in order to understand how they were affected by the Holocaust yet managed to rebuild their lives after the war. While many Holocaust researchers are interested in the historical veracity of narrative memory, the Transcending Trauma research team is interested in how memories are articulated, how the meanings survivors and their family members place on Holocaust experiences are used in the process of continued living. It is, then, the sense that is made of experiences, the symbolic construction, that we are most interested in. However, the research process itself is not immune from scrutiny, as the interviews are in themselves socially constructed and negotiated between researcher/interviewer and interviewee (survivor or family member).

In this particular paper, I will examine the questions and responses of the interviewers and the interviewees in several ways: 1) analyzing the triangulated questions asked of multiple family members in individual interviews. What similarities and differences occur as questions are asked and answers given? What is the negotiated reality that family members and, subsequently, their interviewers come to see? 2) looking for discernible patterns in the ways that questions are asked. The interview schedule that is used is only semi-structured. Are different family members asked identical questions? Which questions open up respondents to longer answers, which lead to shorter answers? Finally, the project itself is explored as a means of constructing memory and understanding the meanings that are placed on specific memories in a context (the Holocaust) that is laden with cultural meanings.

*The project is under the auspices of the Council for Relationships in the Division of Couple and Family Studies in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Jefferson Medical College."

Especially I focus on a theoretical investigation about how network as a new, preferable feature of social life has surfaced historically echoing an ideal of civil society. The rhetoric and reality of the New Economy based upon global and local information production and transmission since the 1990s have brought into the fore a wide array of intra- and interurban informational capacities, roles, and patterns. The postindustrial sociability and sensibility of making civil life more efficient, self-sufficient, and competitive are related to the ways in which technology and innovation shape a new citizenry. A functional understanding of technological innovation, deployment, and penetration in social life is at the risk of simplifying the genealogies, imaginaries, and emergent articulations of network as spatio-temporal the restructuring of various social events. Thus, as exploring Paul Virilio's theoretical endeavor to a politics of speed, I try to look at the critical articulations between Foucault's critique of the practice of liberal governance and Virilio's critique of the urban architecture rhetorically based on a history of war in Western society, so that urban planning issues surrounding recent telecommunication network can be reflected."

We created a library of smoking cessation messages each with meta-data corresponding to the Stages of Change Theory and other factors. We developed a message tailoring system that selects messages for individuals based on behavior change theory and the individuals responses to several questions. In addition to the tailoring system, we created a feedback loop process that uses an individuals relevancy ratings to further refine the message selection process. We performed a pilot study of university students who smoke or had recently quit. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: one received generic, nontailored messages; another received tailored messages based on their answers to questions about their smoking and quitting behavior; and another received messages selected through tailoring and feedback. In the feedback-driven group, participants reported relevance of the messages received averaged higher than the other 2 groups. There was also a highly significant correlation in this group between relevance and social presence, which indicates the feeling of interacting in an interpersonal manner. The results of the pilot study informed the further development of the system (quitplace.com). We created a multisession system, developed triage and stage agents, refined the tailoring and message search algorithms, reduced the number of questions individuals need to answer, added session goals, and made other refinements."

Copying is killing the music, the music industry, it hurts national economies and the global economy and terrorist organizations are financed through piracy . But this vision of the Intellectual Property Armageddon is only one way of looking at the impact of file-sharers on the flow of cultural goods. When it comes to small and secluded linguistic cultural communities beyond the global English language universe, file-sharing might have a surprisingly significant impact on the accessibility of cultural goods."

As an offshoot of this activity, as they interviewed the teens a the community center where some of the teens from this community came for after-school activities, we ended up studying their use of the social networking system  myspace.com. In this chapter, I focus on how my undergraduate students read the identities of the teens from this community through their myspace profiles and the user-end interviews that they conducted. It appeared to us as if the Mexican-American teens were using myspace to produce identities that both reproduce and contest stereotypes about Mexican-Americans. During the course of reading these Mexican-American identities, I also gave my undergraduate students assignments to do textual analyses of the sites of white-appearing users of myspace as well as to examine users of myspace from other ethnicities. My method for collecting data in this chapter is based in action research and cyberethnography (see Gajjala 2004), as I worked with the undergraduate students and with the teens in the community that we worked with.
This analysis will include a critique/discussion/analysis of the ""dominant"" reading done by a white, undergraduate body, who for the most part have not used myspace and come to this social online environment with preconceptions based in television media reports and other social panics about myspace. In addition, this group of students' location influences their reading of the myspace sites through stereotypical perceptions of low-income Mexican Americans. Some of these students were familiar with the social networking system but preferred to use another social networking system called facebook.com, which is frequented by college going populations all over the U.S."

This paper explores the concept of whiteness as it is constructed through the television news coverage of Hurricane Katrina. Using a qualitative content analysis I ask: How do the racial projects of news coverage of Hurricane Katrina articulate and inhabit racial categories? How do these categories define and perpetuate whiteness as a societal norm in the contemporary United States? How do the language and visuals of the television coverage contribute to the image of whites as ordered, rational, and rigid and blacks as disordered, irrational, and loose? Where do we see color- and power-evasiveness employed in framing the discourse? To explore these questions I analyze three network newscasts (ABC, NBC, and FOX) and one cable news station (CNN) from before the hurricane struck until the focus turned to the next hurricane, August 23  September 23, 2005."

2007-1195,Racial Representation in Mainstream Magazine Advertising,Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Racial Representation in Mainstream Magazine Advertising,Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Paper Session,"This study examines the presence and portrayal of racial and ethnic minorities in magazine advertising in 2005. Replicating a similar study by Bowen and Schmid (1997) of magazines published in 1987 and 1992, eight mainstream magazines with significant minority readership were sampled. It was hypothesized that the presence of minorities would have increased in the present study and that the portrayal of minority models would be more favorable, i.e. that the proportion of advertisements showing minority models in a primary role, engaged in a high level of interaction, and in informal interaction settings would have increased. As suggested in the Association Model of advertising (Preston, 1982), consumers evaluation of the elements associated with the product advertised is critical to the persuasion process. Advertisers thus consider how various segments of the population will respond to the inclusion and exclusion of various ethnic groups in the advertisements, and the portrayal of the models. The results showed that the presence of minority models had increased significantly with African-Americans represented in 18.2% of the advertisements, Hispanics in 13.5% of the ads, and Asians in 7.0% of the ads. The portrayal of minorities in the advertisements was generally more favorable compared to the earlier study. The percentage of advertisements with minority models interacting with Caucasian models in social settings and in high levels of involvement had more than doubled. However, the percentage of mixed ethnic advertisements featuring a minority model in a primary role had decreased."

Analysis of the technical parameters of the DAB standard and the industry rhetoric surrounding its adoption and deployment suggests that the future of digital radio may not really be about radio at all. Instead, the backers of the accepted standard stand to functionally privatize the airwaves by adding a private-level licensing requirement to the access gauntlet. The enforcement of this licensing requirement, which may be enabled through a variety of legal means involving intellectual-property rights, stands to cause a concomitant shift of power in the radio licensing system from public to private hands. Additionally, the purveyance of audio content may not lie at the core of broadcasters' business plans anymore. What has traditionally been a medium based on listening and localism might end up being just another wireless broadband data conduit."

The patient, who was on detention, left the hospital and walked in front of a passing truck on nearby busy commuter highway. The incident provoked much discussion on Adelaide talkback radio. The paper, using this incident as an exemplar, investigates the discursive struggle that takes place in radio talkback programs between host, audiences, topics of conversation, radios institutional characteristics and routines, and phone-in participants. In particular, we examine the discursive devices used by phone-in-participants to legitimate or authenticate their opinions. We sought to assess whether there were characteristic ways people diagnosed with mental illness presented themselves and their illness, and what devices these people used to authenticate their self-portrait and positions. We also sought to examine relationships between host and participant, and the nature of these relationships, as expressed in the radio interactions."

Because public health campaigns have encountered many failures in engaging publics in intended healthy behavior change, my examination of the raw-food-lifestyle peoples meaning making of the lifestyle and its followers high level of responsiveness to healthy messages and success rate in healthy behavior change is helpful for enhancing communication scholars understanding of health-related communication behaviors from publics perspectives, i.e., the raw-food-lifestyle people. This enhanced understanding could offer insights into strategic communication planning of public health campaigns, which might contribute to a higher success rate in bringing out intended healthy behavior outcomes."
2007-1199,"Reading Audiences: Texts, Audience Activity and Non-Communication",Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,,,,Paper,"Reading Audiences: Texts, Audience Activity and Non-Communication",Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,"Recent approaches to the study of media audiences have sought to move beyond bipolar conceptualisations of power between text and audiences that have dominated the incorporation/resistance paradigm (Abercrombie and Longhurst 1998). In this endeavour such approaches critically reassess the social and psychological function of media texts as platforms for audience learning, connectivity or pleasure (see for example Hill 2004; Hills 2002).

Drawing on the work of both the Frankfurt and Constance School as well as recent empirical studies of audiences of popular media, this paper argues that these established traditions within audience studies fail to conceptualise the process of reading as a meaningful interaction between text and reader. The paper juxtaposes notions of audience activity and negotiation, which signal a break of the communicative chain between text and reader, with the concept of 'textual blanks' in the Iser's work (1971, 1979), in order to differentiate between (self-)reflective and reflexive readings of media texts. On the basis of this discussion the paper suggests the need to evaluate the aesthetic quality of popular texts and qualitative differences in their reading."
2007-1200,Reading Political Parties as Mediated Texts: The Disappearance of Meaning in Audience Democracies,From the Politics of the Popular to Popular Politics: Political Communication in the Realm of Popular Culture,,,,Paper,Reading Political Parties as Mediated Texts: The Disappearance of Meaning in Audience Democracies,From the Politics of the Popular to Popular Politics: Political Communication in the Realm of Popular Culture,"As the boundaries between popular and political communication have become increasingly blurred, exemplified by actors and sport stars-turned-politicians as well as politicians emulating the staging of popular celebrities, political and popular media texts share an increasing number of features in their composition as well as consumption.

Based on a comparative study of political parties and their everyday life reading by audiences in Britain and Germany, this paper suggests that the more politicians and political parties have moved from product oriented to market oriented approaches in political marketing (Lees Marshment 2001), the closer they have come to forming polysemic texts that, similar to popular texts, invite audiences to build affective bounds based on their textual openness and adaptability to readers specific horizon of expectation.

However, the paper argues that while such forms of popular politics and potential political fandom can foster civic engagement, they lead to the erosion of an intersubjective, denotative core of political texts representing political parties, which undermines the legitimacy of systems of parliamentary representation in media-based, indirect democracies."

A Content Analysis of Online Food Advertising to Children",Advances in Content Analysis Research on Food Marketing to Children,"A primary target for public policy today is, as earlier, television advertising to children. However, the nature and scope of marketing to children is much broader than this. Interactive media, including the Internet, are increasingly being used to target young children. Key stakeholders, including public policy makers, consumer advocates, as well as marketing and communications scholars, need insights into this new advertising medium and how it is being used to communicate with young children. This paper reports the results of a detailed content analysis of food marketers websites that either target children (ages 12 and under) directly or contain content that would likely be of interest to them. The results show that a majority (85%) of food brands that are heavily advertised to children on television are also promoted to them through websites. Children are exposed to an appealing and imaginative array of brand-centric advergames, movie and television tie-ins, customization attempts, viral marketing, and other activities on these websites. Findings characterizing the specific features of these websites are presented, and implications for childrens information processing and public policy are discussed."

Crime Investigation Programmes As Immunisation of Hegemonic Discourse,Resisting Control: Reality Television as Critique,"Crime Investigation Programmes are one of the oldest and one of the most emphatic forms of reality programming. Having been first developed in West Germany in the late 1960s, shows like the German Aktenzeichen XY. ungelöst, the British Crimewatch UK or Americas Most Wanted in the US show so called re-enactments of real crimes with the declared aim to solve these crimes with the help of their viewers. Giving a voice to victims of crime one could think that these programmes offer possibilities for non-hegemonic readings. But instead, it will be argued, Criminal Investigation Programmes use techniques of producing authenticity for immunising hegemonic discourse. Thereby, the current social order is legitimised as natural and not shown as a result of social struggles of groups with conflicting interest. Since these programmes use quite a few strategies of producing authenticity, the viewer is rarely able to distance her/himself from the fact that the crime really has happened and therefore an oppositional reading is barely possible."
2007-1203,"Realism, Voice, and Experience: The Place of Context in Media Ethnography",Context in Media Ethnography,,,,Paper,"Realism, Voice, and Experience: The Place of Context in Media Ethnography",Context in Media Ethnography,"To move away from the surveillance techniques and colonial tendencies of traditional ethnographic practice, fresh approaches to ethnography, such as critical and autoethnographic, emerged with force in the 1990s. These epistemological turns were formulated to foreground the role of the ethnographer while monitoring the colonizing and marginalizing nature of ethnographic practice, and reshape how context was ethnographically understood and represented. Critical and auto ethnographic techniques have been employed by media reception researchers. However, how have these techniques shaped the kinds of ethnographies that media researchers have produced, and have the autoethnographic and critical techniques helped shape a body of ethnographic knowledge about reception context that is richer and more nuanced than traditional ethnography?

Addressing these questions, this paper explores the modes of representation employed by media ethnographers (including the authors own work on media reception in Mexico). To do so, the author draws on Bill Nicholss (1991) typography of documentary film, examining media ethnographies in terms of their use of expository, observational, interactive, and/or reflexive descriptive techniques of representation. Through this typography, a clearer picture of the epistemological assumptions surrounding context in the history of media ethnography is established."
2007-1204,Reality As a Fragile Resource,Reality a Scarce or Abundant Resource?,,,,Paper,Reality As a Fragile Resource,Is Reality a Scarce or Abundant Resource?,"I will argue that there is never the right amount of reality for particular groups and that most of us act as if there is not enough--that reality is under siege. What is at stake when we worry about realitys safety? Reality (scarce or abundant) is often imagined as at risk from modernization and mediation. Is it? Why or why not?
I begin with Walker Percys claims, in The Loss of the Creature, that we need to learn how to wrest the real from its symbolic packaging. Then I explore three instances of presumed reality-under-siege: Disneyland, ecotourism and country music. What do social critics, travelers and music fans think is going on with reality in these and related instances? What do their concerns tell us about how reality is perceived to be at risk, and in need of our protection? What can we learn about reality construction, maintenance, transformation and repair from these examples?"

This paper makes an attempt to develop such a multifaceted approach towards the so-called game-doc, which is amongst the most complex and controversial types of reality television from an aesthetical, socio-political and ethical perspective. First, an eclectic qualitative content analysis (documentary and genre theory, semiotics, media and televi-sion studies) of different cases of reality television shows was carried out. Then, in-depth interviews were conducted with audiences of the programs on the one hand, and individuals who were involved in the production of the several different cases on the other hand (producers, executives, editors and participants). Finally, the findings of the textual and empirical analyses were integrated and compared."
2007-1206,Reasoning and the Mediatic Turn,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,,,,Paper,Reasoning and the Mediatic Turn,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,"Much debate on the nature of the mediatic turn assumes a concomitant transformation of reason. Marianne van den Boomen (this panel) argues that we can only relate to digital media via metaphors, while Jos de Mul talks of the non linear hyperphilosophy of flux and changeability. This paper is an attempt to unpack the metalevel metaphors used to describe reason in the mediated world. In particular, I consider the notion of linearity and reason. The association between the linear display of sentences, the stability of the word on the page, characterised by print, with individual authorship and critical thought on the other is at the heart of much of the debate about the new media. Far too often, there is an uncritical assumption that there is one canonical form of linear reasoning which is paradigmatically found in print. This paper argues against that view."

From a theoretical point of view it could well be argued why it makes sense to focus on girls exclusively. But in the reality of conceptualising, researching, and, last but not least, sharing the results in public, the bipolar construction of the category gender is something we cannot ignore (even if we would like to). However, if this polarity becomes the point of departure of a study, we mainly encounter one thing: differences, to some extent exceedingly stereotypical ones, and that on both ends. Here, issues regarding methodology come up, but also a much more fundamental self-reflection is needed about the way we deal with stereotypes ourselves and to what extent we are genuinely prepared to engage with the sometimes cliché worlds.

A measure of receptivity to alcohol marketing was developed from research about tobacco marketing. Recall and recognition of alcohol brand names were also examined. Data were obtained from in-class surveys of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders in spring 2003 and at 12-month follow-up (in 7th-9th grades). Participants who were classified as never drinkers at baseline (n=1,080) comprised the analysis sample. Logistic regression models examined the association of advertising receptivity at baseline with initiation of alcohol use at follow-up, adjusting for multiple risk factors, including peer alcohol use, school performance, risk taking, and demographics. At baseline, 29% of never drinkers either owned or wanted to use an alcohol branded promotional item (high receptivity), 21% students named the brand of their favorite alcohol ad (moderate receptivity) and 50% were minimally receptive to alcohol marketing. Approximately 29% of adolescents who were never drinkers at baseline had initiated alcohol use by follow-up. Never drinkers who reported high receptivity to alcohol marketing at baseline were 79% more likely to initiate drinking by follow-up than never drinkers who reported minimal receptivity at baseline. Smaller but significant increases in the odds of initiation were associated with better recall and recognition of alcohol brand names. Prevention programs may reduce alcohol marketing receptivity by limiting adolescents' exposure to alcohol ads and promotions or by increasing their skepticism about such tactics."

Despite the growing importance of such teams in modern organizations and the fundamental role played by communication and discursive practices in enacting such teams across time, space, and cultural boundaries, the burgeoning literature on virtual teams tends to take a managerial, functionalist approach regarding communication as a variable rather than examining how virtual teamwork is enacted through communicative practices. This chapter synthesizes the existing literature on virtual teams and provides a critical reassessment of the literature from a communicative perspective. We propose an alternative conceptual framework to the dominant input-processes-outputs model (e.g., Martins, et al., 2004) which situates communication processes as central and suggest an agenda of future research."
2007-1210,Reconciling Intimate Violence: Gendered Myths in Hunter,Caught in the Net: Gender Identity Online,,,,Paper,Reconciling Intimate Violence: Gendered Myths in Hunter,Caught in the Net: Gender Identity Online,"Exploring the intersection of gender and race, the researcher focuses on gendered prescriptions within the Aryan identity in the novel Hunter. The novel draws upon culturally bound myths to supply readers with ethereal explanations, morality, and logic regarding violence against intimates as well as Others. Hunter articulates demonized and deified identities for men and women to teach readers the means by which true Aryan men must protect their racewhich includes the occasional commission of violence against Aryans. In so doing, Hunter establishes a symbolic code for violence against dishonorable men and women (Others) while simultaneously justifying a moral guide for violence against Aryan women. The current work identifies myth as a cultural hermeneutic that illuminates a rationale within the Aryan imagination where intimates can be regarded as sacred on an abstract level and subjected to slaying on a concrete level."

Then, this study found the emergence and activation of concertive control in the organization. Since cleaning-service work is performed in spatially scattered places, cleaning-service workers have some autonomy during their working time. Based on the Korean owners and supervisors trust toward employees, some authority is delegated to Korean cleaning-service workers. In addition, they share culturally common values that have very strong influences on Korean workers personal relationships, working attitudes, and occupational performances. Furthermore, although several interviewees expressed ambivalent identification with KCSC, especially the cleaning-service work, they had strong identification with their culture. Thus, a concertive control system had emerged and was activated through these three conditions."
2007-1212,"Reconstructing Environmental Risk Communication: Toward a Critical, Constitutive Framework","Public Reasoning, ""Truth,"" and Power",,,,Paper,"Reconstructing Environmental Risk Communication: Toward a Critical, Constitutive Framework","Public Reasoning, ""Truth,"" and Power","This essay develops a critical, constitutive framework for the analysis of environmental risk communication, incorporating perspectives from communication theory and from European sociology. In offering this framework I seek to expand the role of communication theory in a field that comprises a multiplicity of competing, and often theoretically-impoverished, models of communication. As an explicitly critical approach, the framework emphasizes the inherently political aspects of risk communication and related issues of organizational and institutional power. It does so by adopting a constitutive model of risk communication, in contrast to prevailing representational, informational, and persuasive models. In order to move beyond unelaborated claims that risks are constituted through discourse, I link phenomenologically-grounded, constitutive theories of communication (e.g., Anton 1999; Deetz, 1973, 1992; Stewart, 1972, 1986, 1995, 1996) with the risk society perspective of Ulrich Beck (1992, 1995a, 1995b, 1999) and the functional systems theory of Niklas Luhmann (1989, 1990, 1993). Although the communication discipline has recognized the general relevance of Luhmanns work, and to a lesser extent Becks, and those authors have written extensively on issues of ecology, risk, trust, and power, the connections between communication theory and their perspectives on ecology and risk have not yet been adequately explored."

Fan Music Videos of a Soap Opera Lesbian Couple,Queer Navigations of Pop Cultural Norms,"Within the study of fan cultures, music videos have been discussed as a genre through which noncanonical narratives can be constructed, and thus proffer up particular rejections and reworkings of the official story. This paper discusses fan videos centering on a lesbian couple, Bianca and Lena, portrayed on the American daytime soap opera All My Children from 2003-2004, and argues that while the canonical status of the same-sex romance differentiated Bianca and Lena from the slash pairings discussed by Jenkins (1992) and Bacon-Smith (1992), the deficiencies of how the Bianca-Lena relationship played out onscreen similarly motivated fans to construct alternative narratives in fan music videos. At the same time, even as the videos challenge the narrative outcomes depicted on the television show, they tend to reproduce conventional discourses that reflect and contribute to the narrowness of LGBT representations in terms of norms around gender and sexual expression, beauty, and class and racial identities."

Gunn's remarks are symptomatic of growing interest communication scholars have in the nondiscursive aspects of messages. In this paper we argue that these nondiscursive elements, frequently discussed with respect to ""rhetorics of display"" -- and which Gunn thinks of as a primary aspect of the central challenge of rhetorical theory (ibid) at the present time -- are frequently dealt with in a series of haphazard(ous) methods that fails to take into account their complexity and systemic interactions. Turning to the writings of classical rhetoricians who grappled with issues of style, we argue for an old systemic approach to unlocking the mysteries of the nondiscursive."

The survey results suggest PR practitioners working for health organizations believed they have Media Expert and Health Expert powers within their organizations. Extensive experience in health PR was a significant predictor of expert powers. In general, they do not believe they exert Coercive and Reward powers. This research also examined the effect of three internal contingent factors on the perceived power of PR practitioners in the organization. Findings suggest that these internal factors are more closely related to power in the organization than power in media relations."

As this paper argues, in addition to understanding the media as a complex system of institutions and technologies that link individuals across space, we need to begin thinking about the media as an integral part of a larger project by which groups recompose their boundaries and select criteria for belonging over time. The paper suggests that while media scholars have most often viewed media systems in terms of the geographical space they encompass, the media have an important role in the historical, dialectical and dynamic process by which the nation and national identity are constructed and maintained over time. It reexamines the work of a number of key media theoreticians (e.g., James Curry, Harold Innis), in order to understand the role the media have played in organizing time. It situates these theorists in a broader body of literature on modernity, the nation, collective memory and history in order help construct a framework for thinking about the way in which narratives about the past, which are articulated through the mass media, act as crucial links to the maintenance of social structures in the present."

In an experimental setting, conservatives and Republicans preferred to read news reports attributed to Fox News and to avoid news from CNN and NPR. Democrats and liberals exhibited exactly the opposite syndrome  dividing their attention equally between CNN and NPR, but avoiding Fox News. This pattern of selective exposure based on partisan affinity held not only for news coverage of controversial issues, but also for relatively ""soft"" subjects such as crime and travel. The tendency to select news based on anticipated agreement was also strengthened among more politically engaged partisans. Overall, our results suggest that the emergence of Fox News has contributed to the polarization of the news audience."

For the latter half of the 20th century the rednecks of our collective imagination have served as a favorite target for derision. The decade of the 1990s saw the term redneck used often in print media, and its use rose dramatically during the last 3 years of the decade. The prevalence of the terms use in print media points to the need for closer attention to such occurrences. This paper offers a close reading of numerous occurrences of the epithet redneck as a slur in print media. It is argued that, as it plays out in print media, the term redneck functions to reify normative whiteness and perpetuate discourses of racism and classism in American culture."

Especially the process of repeated exposure has not been analyzed so far. In the following the phenomenon of repeated exposure to communication is described and differentiated before possible motives for repeated exposures are presented. The paper then discusses processes of repeated exposure and focuses on two experiences that from a theoretical point of view can not be repeated because they depend on uncertainty and unexpectedness: suspense and surprise. A study is presented in which 56 subjects saw a thriller two times  within a time interval of 14 days. It combines real-time response measurement (suspense instruction) with a pre- and postexposure questionnaire covering cognitive and affective experiences as well as preferences and the general evaluation of the film. Results show that surprise and suspense attenuate with repeated exposure, but the characteristic development of the suspense experience  like peaks, spikes etc. within the curve progression  remains the same. Affective experiences are as well toned down but at least partly repeated exposure leads to new cognitive experiences. In addition, differences in view of the suspense progression between certain groups of participants (e.g. liking or disliking the film) are analyzed. Finally, the results are discussed against the background of theoretical considerations."

The findings of the study concern the occurrence of a phenomenon that has been object of limited research: the contamination of press discourse. It is a vice in the reformulation to a secondary discourse from the original one, in which the accurate identification of participants fails. A discourse analysis reveals a striking level of assimilation between what the sources said and what journalist wrote in the articles published. The findings also question the journalists willingness to cut off bias and sources interest from news stories and adjust the message as much as possible to the level of qualification, perspective and interests of their readers."
2007-1222,Refugee Communities and the Politics of Cultural Identity,"Politics of Communication, Cultural Difference, and Diasporas",,,,Paper,Refugee Communities and the Politics of Cultural Identity,"Politics of Communication, Cultural Difference, and Diasporas","The term diaspora, which productively engages with the complexities of migration and the formation of cultural identities, has itself come under theoretical scrutiny. In his attempt to build on and refine Safrans (1991) tabulation of features that characterise the diasporic experience, Cohen (1997) distinguishes between types of diaspora and the subtle differences between them.Cohens careful depiction of the histories of dispersal and settlement of victim diasporas clearly portrays such communities as having complex ties with notions of home that are qualitatively different from that of other types of diaspora. In addition to this, his argument includes an attempt to distinguish between the different victim diasporas: the Jewish, Palestinian, Irish, African, and Armenian. Underlying this, and relatively unexplored in the book, is the claim or assumption that the experience of their forced migration and of victimhood, as well as the mediation of them both within and outside the communities themselves, inform the identities of such communities. The present paper seeks to explore a few of the complex ideas that buttress this important observation, building on Malkkis (1995) ethnographic study of Hutu refugees in Tanzania to engage with the notions of experience, subalternity, and the intricate politics of cultural expression and identity. It will be argued that conceiving refugee communities as diaspora includes exploring the validity of the politics of the subalterns appeal to experience. Intrinsic to this, as we shall see, is the politics of representation and recognition."

Telecommunications and Global Knowledge Issues,,,,Paper,Regionalization of Telecommunications Regulatory Policy: A Model to Assess Regional Effects on National Regulations,Competition or Regulation? Telecommunications and Global Knowledge Issues,"Since the 1990s regional economic communities (such as EU, APEC, and ASEAN), through semi-independent regional regulators associations (RRAs), are increasingly developing telecommunications model regulation, aiming to harmonize telecommunications regulation across member states. Through increased predictability of the regulatory environment, regionalization is believed to stimulate investments across borders and thus increase telecommunications market development. However, there is yet to be a generalizable analysis of the specific effects of RRAs on market development and the particular mechanisms of influence. To this extent, this study identifies primary parameters that contribute to the performance of RRAs, which include the development and adoption of regional model regulations, and in turn will affect market development. We develop propositions based on a theoretical framework that can be used in future studies as the basis for in-depth single regional integration body cases and can serve as a starting point for comparative studies of regional integration bodies."

This has resulted in the formation of powerful, sector-wide regulators in both markets, established by Act of Parliament, funded by a levy on industry, with statutory requirements to act in the interest of the consumer and citizen. In the communications sector this new super regulator is the Office of Communications (Ofcom). In this paper we review the debates over the formation of this new regulator, focusing on the way that citizens and consumers have been represented in legislation and regulatory design. We pay particular attention to critics of the emerging regulatory regime from both market liberals and civil society bodies and we interpret these debates against the background of social theoretical writing on the shifting relationship between the state, commerce, civil society and the public."

The project also suggests how understanding the relation between reinventing government and reinventing TV requires rethinking some of the dispositions of critical studies of TV and other media, and considering the utility of the recent literature that has engaged Michel Foucaults thoughts about liberalism, governmentality, care of the self, technologies of the self, ethico-politics, and biopolitics. We argue that TV has become instrumental to the networks that now link the public, private, and personal programs and techniques for administering welfare."
2007-1226,Relational Aspects of Mediated Interpersonal Communication,Towards a Concept of Mediated Interpersonal Communication: Regarding the Cell Phone as a Hybrid Medium,,,,Paper,Relational Aspects of Mediated Interpersonal Communication,Towards a Concept of Mediated Interpersonal Communication: Regarding the Cell Phone as a Hybrid Medium,"The proposal is interested in communication processes which are conducted via information and communication technologies. As ICTs have become a natural part of everyday life people communicate not only in vis-à-vis-situations but also practice mediated communication e.g. via landline phone, cell phone, e-mail, instant messaging (Walther 2002, Wood/Duck 2006). Thereby new communication situations arise and it is essential to analyze this progression as a communication phenomenon. The focus of this research is not prior on the technology and its characteristics; it is much more on the specifics of the (mediated) interaction between the communication partners and on the situational arrangement. Quoting Höflich (2005) and starting from looking at vis-à-vis-situations it is systematically derived how the arrangement of various forms of mediated communication can be modeled. The arrangement of cell phone communication is outstanding because it implies a mobility of use and has to consider a wide range of situation types. Whereas in a vis-à-vis-situation the requirements and relational rules are quite evident for the involved a more complex arrangement has to be considered in a cell phone communication situation. The question arises how people handle this complex situation, define the situation and anticipate the communication rules in it.

An observational field study of cell phone usage in everyday live in Germany was conducted in Summer 2006. Using qualitative content analysis the data was viewed in respect of communication behavior, nonverbal behavior, movement in the place and behavior related to the present people. The findings enable to characterize and describe the phenomenon of mobile communication and to answer the research question about changes of communication arrangements and the impact of relational aspects between involved people depending on the situational context. It is assumed that different places and therefore different situational requirements demand a different communication behavior. The findings clarify that the relationship between two people communicating with each other by cell phone is defining the communication situation as well as physical and contextual factors. Accepting different levels of relationships it is examined how the relevance of rules is defined. Not only aspects of interpersonal communication between individuals who have a personal relationship are relevant in this context; as people using their cell phone in public places other present people have to receive attention as well. Concerning this kind of relation, rules of a more formal and role-related kind have to be considered in the mobile communication situation."
2007-1227,Relational Identities of Always-Single Japanese Women in Japan,Communicating Identity and Self-Presentation,,,,Paper,Relational Identities of Always-Single Japanese Women in Japan,Communicating Identity and Self-Presentation,"In recent years, an increasing number of Japanese women remain single after the traditionally marked marriageable age of twenty-something. The review of literature indicates the importance of interpersonal relationships for single women, and the influence of some of these relationships on Japanese women remaining single. I interviewed 30 always-single Japanese women in Japan to examine their interpersonal relationships. The content-analysis of the data revealed 3 themes that relate to the womens interpersonal relationships: 1) family dependency and responsibility, 2) social support, and 3) relationship issues that prevent marriage. These themes suggest that single womens 1) role as a daughter/family member, 2) romantic experiences, and 3) relationships with other women influence the construction of their identities. Particularly, the womens accounts presented interrelated issues among various relationships, suggesting importance of understanding history and continuity of relationships."

This study explored the various communicative and cognitive means by which U.S. military-affiliated romantic partners maintain their relationships during deployment. We conducted 43 in-depth, semistructured interviews with partners of enlisted and reserve military personnel who were currently or recently deployed for military service throughout the world, including wartime deployments to Iraq. Qualitative analysis revealed 28 maintenance behaviors, each of which was classified as belonging to one of three supracategories: intrapersonal, dyadic, and network. We describe and provide examples of each emergent maintenance behavior and discuss the implications of this research for both communication and military scholarship. We conclude by offering several directions for further research."
2007-1229,Relational Uncertainty and Message Processing in Marriage,Uncertainty in Communication and Uncertainty in Relationships,,,,Paper,Relational Uncertainty and Message Processing in Marriage,Uncertainty in Communication and Uncertainty in Relationships,"We theorized that spouses experiencing relational uncertainty may employ a pessimism heuristic to process messages such that they evaluate their partners behavior negatively, appraise conversation as threatening, and feel negative emotion. We conducted a study in which 125 couples engaged in videotaped conversations. Hierarchical linear modeling results indicated that spouses judged their partners messages unfavorably under conditions of relational uncertainty (H1, H2). In contrast, outside observers did not detect differences in the messages (RQ1). Relational uncertainty was positively associated with spouses appraisals of the self threat and relationship threat of conversation (H3, H4) and their feelings of negative emotion (H5, H6). In sum, spouses experiencing relational uncertainty may have strong negative reactions to conversations that seem ordinary to outside observers."

Aligning with the parameters of the model, the authors investigated how relational uncertainty and partner interference surfaced within issues that confront people coping with infertility. An analysis of online discussion boards and blogs was conducted to identify common relational issues experienced by infertile couples. Then, the issues were further probed for themes related to relational uncertainty and partner interference. We found that relational uncertainty surfaced through themes focused on relational invalidation and the implications of blame. Interference from a partner permeated these topics when infertility dominated both daily life and sexual intimacy or when expectations for treatment involvement were violated. Our analysis also revealed identity development in the form of a strengthened relational identity or a personal identity shift as prominent within the infertility experience."
2007-1231,"Relational Uncertainty, Perceived Fairness, and the Division of Household Labor",Uncertainty in Communication and Uncertainty in Relationships,,,,Paper,"Relational Uncertainty, Perceived Fairness, and the Division of Household Labor",Uncertainty in Communication and Uncertainty in Relationships,"This study examined the relationship between relational uncertainty and perceptions of division of household labor (DHL). Specifically, research questions explored perceived fairness in DHL and relational uncertainty, perceptual convergence of contributions, convergence of perceptions and relational uncertainty, and convergence of perceptions and relationship satisfaction. A behavioral methodology design called the Household Portrait Technique was employed. Couples independently completed a self-report instrument and jointly participated in the Household Portrait activity. Results showed that husbands and wives were agreed in their perceptions of fairness. Couples agreed that husbands do more of the outdoor work and automobile maintenance whereas wives do more of the childcare. Convergent perceptions regarding DHL was positively associated with relational certainty and marginally associated with relationship satisfaction."

Contrary to common belief that central and online processing concur, the study found evidence of central and memory-based processing. Scenes shown at the beginning of a story determined peoples memory and attitudes about the political candidates shown in broadcast news, which indicates that people processed the information through the central route. SEM analyses show that people formed impression of candidates based on what they recalled from the story. The implication of the finding is discussed in the study."

Content analysis of 100 Fortune 500 companies Web sites revealed that the corporations designed their Web sites to serve important publics (media, customers, investors, and employees) as well as to foster dialogic communication. Still, the corporations could take more advantage of dialogic features of the Web by implementing more interactive strategies (e.g., holding more news forums and discussions, providing explicit statement inviting users to return, and offering a site map). In terms of relationship management, the results suggest that the corporate Web sites attempted to promote control mutuality, trust, satisfaction, openness, and intimacy. However, with respect to conservation of visitors and generation of return visits, the corporations need to maintain repetitive interactions with their publics to enhance trust, commitment, and exchange relationship."

Structures and processes have traditionally been used to shield the organization from disruptive changes from the environment. However, the digital revolution, information based economy, and effects of globalization have forced organizations to reassess their strategic management approaches. Reliable business models of the past are being radically adjusted using networking, looser controls, relationships, participation, and artificial intelligence through self-organization. This paper will examine what these relationships will look like, and how they should be managed in a postmodern business environment."

Based on the relationship maintenance strategies of access, positivity, openness, assurances, networking, and sharing of tasks, the investor relations links of 2005 Forbes 200 Best Small Companies Web sites were content analyzed. Corporate Web sites were largely financial publics-friendly, and no difference was found between the corporate ranking and the number of Web sites clearly labeling the investor relations link. Openness was the most prevalent relationship maintenance strategy, while positivity was the least preferred. Relationship maintenance strategies that small companies employed on their investor relations link seem to be related to their financial performance. This research contributes to enlarging the research scope to several types of publics in public relations scholarship, as well as helps investor relations practitioners develop strategies in the investor relations areas of corporate Web sites for maintaining relationships with their financial publics."

However, children and adolescents often play a significant role as publics (members, customers, and volunteers) in the organization-public relationship. This study takes the first step toward analyzing the organization-child relationship by identifying ways that organizations engage maintenance strategies with these young members of publics. Websites of the top 100 nonprofit organizations were reviewed for content directed toward children and adolescents. Of those sites, 41 contained material for young people. Those sites were analyzed for their use of relational maintenance strategies. The results found a fairly consistent application of the strategies across organization type and organization size with the exception of strategies of openness and shared tasks which were more likely to be engaged by larger organizations."

Adults (N = 155) responded about one of 4 television programs  2 reality-based and 2 fictional shows. They responded about their show enjoyment, identification with and dispositions toward their favorite personality, and show-related behaviors. Results support the uses and gratifications perspective as more involved viewers experience greater enjoyment. Identification mediates the effect of show-related behaviors on enjoyment. Results also support disposition theory as more positive dispositions toward a liked personality are associated with greater enjoyment. Findings also shed light on the similarities and differences between these fictional and reality-based shows."

After a discussion of the definition of the relationship maintenance strategies, the procedures used in developing and refining the multiple-item measures are described. The developed measures can help public relations professionals better understand how to maintain or nurture relationships with their target publics."
2007-1239,Religion as the Ontology of the Social: The Muslim Immigrant in (Danish) Public Discourse,dentity Spaces in Communicative Spheres,,,,Paper,Religion as the Ontology of the Social: The Muslim Immigrant in (Danish) Public Discourse,Identity Spaces in Communicative Spheres,"A recent article in The New York Times (8 January 2006) entitled Denmark Is Unlikely Front in Islam-West Culture War described the fierce debate on Islam and Muslim immigrants. The Danish Prime Minister declared in 2003 that the future of Denmark depends on cultural struggle, not economic policy. His vision for Danish society is to create a strong cohesive force but the obstacle is an aggressive practice of Islam [that provides] the greatest challenge to this vision. The source of the problem is some isolated groups of [Muslim] immigrants who challenge the democratic values. The main argument in this presentation is that Islam and Muslim immigrants have, since the mid-80s, increasingly been represented as a threat to Danish national identity, which is see as homogenous, secularized Christian culture (as precondition for welfare and democracy). The far right articulated an antagonism between Danish national identity and immigration (from Muslim countries) in terms of incommensurable cultures. This has become the main controversy around which the issues of identity, globalization, and welfare system are discussed and (re)articulated. The basic premise for this presentation is straightforward: It is impossible to locate Islam as a unified or homogenous set of practices, ideas, or beliefs. Yet, we speak of Islam as if its meaning is given once for all. If Islam does not exist, because it escapes predication, how can we still manage to talk about it as a unified totality? And more importantly: what does such talk do? I attempt to answer this question from a hegemony perspective  that the way we talk about Islam is intimately connected to its rhetorical function: it creates powerful social ontologies (social-political identifications such as Danes vs. Muslim immigrants). What Islam stands for is not given in Islam itself; it has to be articulated as a homogeneous totality out of a shapeless mass of cultural and religious practices."
2007-1240,Remaking East Asian Identity in Intra-Asian Cultural Flows: A Case Study of Young Chinese Consumption of Korean TV dramas,Viewing/Forming Asia Through Visual Media: From Visual/Cultural Perspective,,,,Paper,Remaking East Asian Identity in Intra-Asian Cultural Flows: A Case Study of Young Chinese Consumption of Korean TV dramas,Viewing/Forming Asia Through Visual Media: From Visual/Cultural Perspective,"Recently Korean cultural products have been popular in East Asian countries. It is an extraordinary situation in history of the Korean culture, because modern Korean culture has been established mainly by being affected from foreign countries.
Since 1997, Korean TV programs have broadcast in Asian countries including China. They have been a great success. In this paper, I investigate why and how Korean TV programs, especially focusing on dramas, get popularity from young Chinese audiences. Through this, this research tries to explain the operation of cultural globalization in intra-Asian context and its influences in recreating young East Asians cultural identities. In order to understand this, this study analyzes textual and contextual factors behind the popularity of Korean dramas in China. As textual factors, this study shows that, Asian modernity and cultural similarities that Korean drama texts embody, are significant in making Chinese audience feel attractive to Korean dramas. Also, contextual factors, such as China's reform policy, the development of cultural industry and the emergence of young audience as a major consumer of cultural products, play an important role in diffusing Korean mass culture in China. Finally, this paper discusses that this kind of cultural flow indicates the diversities of globalization, by presenting a significant example of dynamics intra-regional interaction among the non-western countries."

An Examination of Memory of Gendered Sports Broadcasts,Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,"Prevous research has shown greater encoding for sports broadcasts featuring female athletes rather than male athletes. This study attempts to replicate these results, while disentagling a possible confound from the previous study based on team and individual sports competitions within masculine and feminine sports. Memory sensitivity and criterion bias will be examined after the viewing of these gendered sports portrayals in an effort to determine if encoding is better for typical sports broadcasts (masculine team sports featuring male athletes) or atypical sports broadcasts (feminine individual sports featuring female athletes)."
2007-1242,Remix Culture: Competing Visions and Realities,"The Rise of Remix Culture: Identity, Power, and Imagination",,,,Paper,Remix Culture: Competing Visions and Realities,"The Rise of Remix Culture: Identity, Power, and Imagination","Remix culture involves more than the appropriation of existing cultural products via emerging digital and network technologies. Different constituents are appropriating the very idea of remix culture along varying theoretical, political, and ideological lines. As with other emergent internet technologies, remix practices are accompanied by familiar tropes such as democracy, anarchy, property, control, and legality. Even the free culture and Creative Commons movements that epitomize remix culture have created controversies involving fair use vs. copyright, open vs. private, and free vs. commercial. These fissures challenge the assumption of a unified notion of remix culture, and provide insight into the social construction of the ideas and technologies of remix. This paper critiques the competing visions surrounding remix culture and explores empirical realties through qualitative interviews of remixers themselves."
2007-1243,Rent-Seeking and Capture in Chinese Media,ternational & Development Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Rent-Seeking and Capture in Chinese Media,International & Development Communication Interactive Paper Session,"To make media slanting toward their interest, a growing number of pressure groups have resorted to the coercive power of state to interfere with media routine, which we conceptualize as rent-seeking. The analysis of report requirements and prohibitions in a newspaper finds that the outcomes of rent seeking account for forty percent, which demonstrates the capture of Propaganda Department by powerful interest groups. Against the background of media commercialization, Propaganda Department has also faced with a trade-off between satisfying the needs of interest groups and the needs of media market. Thus, Propaganda Department draws out rules with different wordings and degree of rigidity, based on which media constitute their boundaries and conduct bargaining. The deprived groups, without sufficient resource to conduct rent seeking, are totally excluded in news. In sum, Chinese media are involved in ""dual distortions,"" with some part slanting toward ruling Party ideology, and some toward a small number of powerful interest groups."

This study examined the use and effectiveness of repair strategies with varying hurtful messages, as well as linkage with relational satisfaction and conflict tactics. Responses from 237 married adults indicated that the justification repair strategy was used most often, followed by questioning. The repair strategy of silence was perceived as the least effective overall. Informative messages were perceived as the most hurtful. Sources intent and relational satisfaction were not significantly related to hurtful messages or their subsequent repair strategies, however, having a verbally aggressive conflict style was positively correlated with certain types of hurt."

The sample is drawn from 23 weekly black newspapers and 12 daily mainstream newspapers for a 17-month period between April 1, 2004, and August 28, 2005. A total of 157 staff-generated cancer stories were analyzed. Reporters appear more likely to report on gender-specific cancers such as breast cancer and prostate cancer more so than lung cancerwhich is the leading cause of U.S. deaths. Female staff appeared to write slightly more stories than male staff for mainstream newspapers and that male staff more often wrote stories for black newspapers."
2007-1246,Reporting Atrocity and Travelling Philosophy,Public Sphere in Mediated Frameworks,,,,Paper,Reporting Atrocity and Travelling Philosophy,Public Sphere in Mediated Frameworks,"John Durham Peters has argued that there are three major forms of witnessing: legal, religious, and of atrocity. This paper suggests that a powerful fourth form arises as a response to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's injunction -- in note X of the Discours sur les origines de l'inegalite -- to find a way of reporting on colonised peoples without ethnocentric bias. The paper examines French explorer and naturalist Francois Levaillant and his reports on atrocities carried out by Dutch colonists in the late eighteenth century. Levaillant, however, in his reporting, encountered ethical and political and ideological barriers to reporting colonial atrocity that Rousseau had not anticipated. In doing this, he uncannily anticipated much of what would occur during the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission two centuries later. The paper suggests also that Nicolas Chamfort, who reviewed Levaillant and approved his ironic treatment of colonial ideology, may have influenced Nietzsche. The paper points out how poor scholarship by many postcolonial critics of Levaillant neglects the key ways in which Enlightenment thought drew on colonial accounts, accounts which influenced colonial policy strongly. Reading Levaillant should give a more complex history of the reporting of atrocity and alter our sense of the history and importance of black witnessing in South Africa."

Qualitative interviews with 24 community journalists working in cities in Upstate New York are used to answer the following research questions: (1) how does content regarding authority fairness find its way into news stories, (2) what facets of justice  whether distributive, voice, or relational  do journalists emphasize, and (3) to what extent do journalists believe readers make fairness judgments based on local news coverage? The interviewed journalists recounted that they often used their evaluation of local politicians fairness in deciding whether to pursue a story. In doing so, these journalists highlighted questions of whether journalists were listening to community members and the degree to which politicians appeared to take the best interest of citizens to heart. There was little agreement among journalists about the degree to which citizens could adequately make fairness judgments based on local news coverage, although the television reporters believed that televisions visual component provided key information about the fairness of local politicians."

New terms like 'migrant workers' has begun to be used in international labor market, and South Korea could not be an exception in this trend. In fact, Korea was one of typical countries exporting labor, but this situation was reversed in 1990s when influx of foreign immigrant workers was rapidly increased and various social problems stemming from it were occurred.
The main purpose in this study is to examine means of producing discourses by media which makes major discourses ideologically biased toward nationalism. It will be analyzed how the media gives a concrete form to abstract ideology, and how the ideological discourses transform some subtle cultural and/or social differences into fundamental differences. More specifically, it will be examined how foreign immigrant workers in South Korea are represented in Korean TV and how the discourses based on exclusive nationalism and on the alienation of foreigners are fortified. For a comparative purpose, the image of Korean emigrant workers working in foreign countries represented in Korean TV will be examined, too. Through these processes, it will be consulted how this 'dual perspective' of the media towards 'They(Others)' and 'We(Ourselves)' in Korean society functioned and how the discourses immanent in this perspective or the discourses reorganized by this perspective should be interpreted.
The texts of more than 20 TV documentaries aired by three major television channels in Korea treating problems related to 'foreign immigrant workers' and 'Korean emigrant workers' will be closely analyzed. In this study, the analysis of the texts will be composed of analysis of description, analysis of critical discourses, and analysis of image texts, however relative overlapping of these three are inevitable. TV documentaries will be multi-laterally analyzed based on three categories: Image as visual description; Narration and Interview as explanation; and Descriptive structure as overall unfolding. Finally, the actual state of cultural and social discourses represented by the media will be estimated.
While studies on migrant workers have been limited to a few categories such as national policy making and anthropological study, we researchers hope this study will contribute to the understanding of media discourses concerning discrimination against foreign migrant workers and cultural exclusionism."

For several years the author has been developing the use of creative visual methods, using video, drawings, collage, etc. These offer alternatives to studies which presume that people can generate instant accounts of their inner worlds in language. In this study, 79 individuals from varied backgrounds were given time to work through a research process in which they ultimately produced a model of their identity, and influences, using metaphors. This was a variation of the Lego Serious Play consultancy process. Findings show individuals understand their identities as complex, balanced wholes, often involving the metaphor of a journey. They negotiate tensions between individual distinctiveness and social responsibilities. The media plays a role by offering models of narratives through which individuals understand and narrate their identity stories."

Our information about the North Korea is very limited because we only get the filtered information through the representation on the media. But it is necessary to point out that it is no use to clarify whether the media representation is correct or not. This is because the reality we accept is already constructed by the re-presentation. Among the various ways of representation including verbal text, sound, and visual images, the visual is crucial because people tend to believe in photographic truth. In other words, they tend to think that photos automatically reflect the real.
In this paper, we will study the role of photography in representing (and constructing the image of) North Korea. More specifically, we will examine how the representation of North Korea differs in the news photos in Korea, U.S.A., and Japan. We will gather the photos during the period of 6 months and categorize them by specific themes. Through this analysis, we will figure out how those three countries differently represent North Korea. It will provide us the way how the representation and meanings are constructed according to the culture and context."

As a way to move beyond such essentialized images, this paper looks at ways Blaqck teens use online media to circumvent mediated mainstream media and present themselves in more dynamic and complex ways through blogs, radio documentaries, etc. The great digital divide debate assumes marginalized folks seldom, if ever, use the web. This paper argues that not only are many Black teens using the web, but they are also uploading and producing their own content.

In this paper I examine why diasporic media are often unifyingly lumped as bastions of resistant ethnicity on one end of the spectrum and fetishized spaces of transnational, cultural subversion on the other. Without negating the progressively resistant potential of diasporas, I argue that our focus on diasporic space as a site of persistent cultural traveling may obscure the importance of the local context in our understanding of the diasporic experience. My discussion of Beur FM problematizes this perception through the radio station's defining role within the beur community in France. All cultural frameworks can be ambivalent in diaspora, but in the case of Beur FM and the French riots, this is yet again another example of the beur perennial struggle to reconcile their deployment of ethnicity with an old 'constant' of French political philosophy and culture: French republicanism."

Of particular interest are the ways that interactants can resist the effort to quantify their habits, while still paying deference to the question. Interactants do this via various methods of accounting for their resistance. Fundamental to most of the methods for resisting quantification is the effort to invoke or appeal to the situated lived context of ones habit. That is, most of these methods of resistance involve an appeal that the de-contextualized count is not an adequate or appropriate representation of ones habit."
2007-1261,Resisting Organizational Irrationality: Strategies for an Alternative Organizational Rationalization at Head Start,Creating Organizational Resistance,,,,Paper,Resisting Organizational Irrationality: Strategies for an Alternative Organizational Rationalization at Head Start,Creating Organizational Resistance,"This project examines the ways in which Head Start employees recognize and respond to organizational irrationality in their daily work activities. Organizational irrationality can be defined as the everyday practices that pull organizational members in different and sometimes competing directions. Irrationality includes organizational phenomena such as paradox, contradiction, tension, and irony and is not necessarily negative. In fact, members can use irrationality to resist organizational control. Using a grounded theory approach, observations of and interviews with Head Start employees were analyzed using a feminist communicology. Interestingly, Head Start employees do not perceive the irrationality as irrationality. They construct an alternative rationality that allows them to use the organizational irrationality to their benefit."

Some scholars see enormous potential for public relations and the information subsidy to help get important social issues on the public agenda (Taylor, 2000, Taylor & Doerfel, 2005). Other scholars have critiqued the practice of public relations in newly formed nations as a form of hegemony that privileges Western ideas, values, and standards of practice (Dutta-Bergman, 2005). One thing is certain: more scholarly attention is required if the field of public relations is to truly understand its evolving role in civil society. The purpose of this paper is to explore how public relations can contribute to civil society development. The researcher interviewed media professionals, public relations/organizational spokespersons, and civil society experts about the opportunities and challenges of public relations function in building civil society in Kosovo. The findings suggest that protocol journalism is the guiding framework for explaining how public relations and the media work together in building civil society. The implications of this protocol journalism are discussed and recommendations provided to help create a more balanced and mutually beneficial public relations-media relationship."

Rural areas provide a unique context for studying this issue since their residents and their communities have a heightened need for social support. The present research examined the effects of internet usage on perceived social support in sample of 891 internet users drawn from four rural communities. Path analysis revealed a link between the use of the internet to obtain social outcomes and perceived social support. However, the ability to obtain online social support also decreased community attachment."

Previous research employing prepulse modulation of the startle reflex has examined the effect of a prepulse using only single-modality stimuli (i.e., pictures and sounds). Research in this simpler paradigm suggests that the SR can index both motivational responding and cognitive resource allocation. The current study utilizes television content as a dual-modality stimulus. An initial study found that startle probes that followed a camera change were affected by the time lapse between camera change and startle probe. However, the camera change was visual, and the startle probe was audio. By observing individuals responses after they experience an acoustic prepulse (which will induce an OR) and an acoustic startle probe while watching affective television messages, this study examines whether affective and attentive states can be measured using startle probe methodology."

Especially, the perceivable distinction between the actions of human (i.e., avatar) and computer generated representations (i.e., agent) is increasingly being blurred. This study investigated the effects of the coplayers source of agency (avatar vs. agent) and the type of gaming activity (competition vs. cooperation). A 2 (Avatar, Agent) x 2 (Competition, Cooperation) within-subject design experiment was conducted (N=32). The results demonstrated that the coplayers source of agency moderates the nature of gaming experiences in a significant way. Players exhibited greater physiological arousal when their coplayer was perceived as being an avatar rather than an agent. Furthermore, the coplayers source of agency interacted with the type of gaming activity. In the Avatar condition, the task type did not influence the players rating of valence and presence. However, in the Agent condition, players experienced significantly more negative valence and less degree of presence in competition than in cooperation. The results highlight the theoretical implications of a video games opportunities to manipulate the game players representation and effects on game players emotional experiences."

In this study, I explore the ways in which the past is referenced in the present using past racist events as a case study. Specifically, I examine the rhetorical mechanisms utilized by Black print media when past racist events are invoked in the discussions of current events. I hypothesize that in certain situations, particular past injustices are used as heuristics to give greater meaning to current events.
This study is theoretically based in scholarship in rhetoric, collective memory and journalism studies. To analyze the discourse around these events, I conducted a content analysis on the usage of two specific icons, the Rodney King Beating and the Tuskegee Experiment, in the Black press from 2002 to 2005. I choose these events because the meanings associated with them have eclipsed the life of the stories, often serving as poignant exemplars of racism in Americas recent history. The primary content analysis explored if and how past racist events are used. Once the articles were collected, we noted which current events emerged repeatedly in connection with Tuskegee or Rodney King. We then conducted a secondary search from the same sample using the current event as the search terms. In this way, I am able to compare coverage of the same news event, both with and without the historical reference."
2007-1267,Rethinking the Organizational in Organizational Socialization Research: From Ontological Agent to Discursive Domain(s),Organizational Anticipation Through Detachment,,,,Paper,Rethinking the Organizational in Organizational Socialization Research: From Ontological Agent to Discursive Domain(s),Organizational Anticipation Through Detachment,"Throughout the 1990s, Communication Monographs featured a series of articles elaborating a growing critique of traditional approaches to organizational socialization focusing on stage model approaches and organizational assimilation, culminating in a debate featured in the December 1999 issue of this journal. This essay attempts to articulate a broader understanding of organizational socialization as a construct by revisiting that debate, and reading the subsequent communication-based work explicitly billed as organizational socialization in its terms. Specifically, I argue that while the critical voices in that debate offered a persuasive call for an understanding of organizational socialization that moves beyond the boundaries of ontological organizations, subsequent communication-based research has remained overwhelmingly grounded in the stage model and organizational assimilation perspectives. In an effort to take up the call of the critical voices in that debate, I then offer a tentative model of a broader conception of organizational socialization conceived of as a series of discursive domains: work/identity socialization, vocational/occupational socialization, anticipatory socialization, and organizational assimilation. Such a model would shift the focus of the term organizational from referring only to specific organizations to a focus on a broader organizational context. This move would allow researchers to better account for the nature of organizational socialization in an organizational context increasingly marked by contingent employment, while at the same time preserving space for the continued vitality of traditional approaches to the subject."
2007-1268,Retirement Communication: Exploring Uncertainty and Information Seeking,Organizational Anticipation Through Detachment,,,,Paper,Retirement Communication: Exploring Uncertainty and Information Seeking,Organizational Anticipation Through Detachment,"Although the communication process during retirement seems theoretically similar to that of organizational disengagement, most disengagement communication research has focused primarily on turnover, job burnout, layoffs, and transfers. The following analysis focuses on information seeking as a communication process that shapes employees retirement planning and transition. Drawing from organizational socialization research, retirement information seeking will be explored and, by employing uncertainty reduction theory (URT; Berger & Calabrese, 1975; Berger & Bradac, 1982), this study investigated uncertainty during retirement planning and linked it to information-seeking behavior. Three hypotheses were proposed that related three types of uncertainty (financial, health, and social status) to information-seeking behavior. A probability sample of 207 high-school teachers responded to a quantitative questionnaire about their retirement planning. Results indicate a definite link between all three types of uncertainty and information seeking during the retirement planning process. However, findings suggest that although uncertainty about maintaining a particular social status and lifestyle is important, it certainly is not as important as uncertainty about their financial future or post-retirement healthcare, both primary drivers of information seeking behavior. Theoretical implications and directions for future research are discussed."

The purpose of this discussion is to explore how current discourse on media development resonates with foundational approaches to development communication. I advocate broadening the scope of media development to include political engagement, economic context, and media systems and genres, and to examine these issues across historical and situational contexts."

In 2001 the UK Home Office published a review of literature that examined academic research into violent video games between 1985-1994. This UK-funded review builds and extends on that work, examining academic literature relating to violent video games and violent behaviour up to 2004. The review has 4 key objectives: to revisit the Home Office review from 2001, ensuring that all key studies examining the relationship between playing violent computer games and real-world violence in young people, carried out between 1985-2004, are covered; to advise on the quality and reliability of research carried out to date in this area; to advise on the extent to which existing research does or does not provide evidence of a link between the playing of computer games and subsequent behaviour; and to make recommendations as to how current gaps in our knowledge of this area could be filled, together with a discussion of the practicalities of doing so."
2007-1271,Revisited: Communication Media Use in the Grandparent/Grandchild Relationship,Trends in Media Choice and Use,,,,Paper,Revisited: Communication Media Use in the Grandparent/Grandchild Relationship,Trends in Media Choice and Use,"The study at hand built on Harwoods (2000) study investigating media use in interactions between grandparents and grandchildren, replicating some of Harwoods research. It also extending Harwoods study by adding the technologies of the cell phone, email, and instant messenger to the media he investigated (face-to-face, written documents, and telephone). Such a study allows finding out whether the availability of new technologies has any effect on the grandparent/grandchild relationship. Sixty-six dyads (N = 132) of grandchildren and grandparents participated in the study, completing a questionnaire on basic demographics, media use, and relational quality. Results show usage divides between grandchildren and grandparents, as well as within the grandparent group. The cell phone and face-to-face interaction are used most frequently in the grandparent/grandchild relationship. Technologies such as email or instant messenger are not used much even across the geographic distance they were designed to overcome. Follow up tests to a significant ANOVA did not show significant results for medium type chosen based on who initiates contact. Face-to-face remains the strongest predictor of quality inter-generational relationships, followed by use of the cell phone, the landline phone, and email (in that order). Findings are discussed in light of both media richness theory and the social influence model."

Results reveal that discussion significantly predicts two different forms of political knowledge controlling for media use and demographic variables, and that education significantly weakens the relationship between political discussion and ideological knowledge."
2007-1273,Revisiting the Concept of Selective Exposure,"lective Exposure, News, and Politics",,,,Paper,Revisiting the Concept of Selective Exposure,"Selective Exposure, News, and Politics","Few consistent conclusions have been reached in research on selective exposure - the motivated selection of information that matches one's beliefs. While some scholars argue that selective exposure occurs, others dismiss selective exposure as an antiquated concept. After briefly reviewing the controversial history of selective exposure, this paper aims to clarify the concept. First, this paper argues that we should not expect people to engage in selective exposure based on any topic. Rather, certain topics are more likely to inspire people to engage in selective exposure relative to others. Politics is isolated as one topical domain where people may be particularly likely to engage in selective exposure. Second, this paper argues that studies of a single media exposure decision (e.g. viewing a film) should be supplemented with studies that attempt to more comprehensively model people's media exposure decisions across-outlets. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, this study then turns to empirically evaluating selective exposure. Categorizing thousands of individual responses about people's newspaper, talk radio, cable television, and Internet use, this study supports the idea that people's political beliefs are related to their media exposure patterns. Through the use of over-time analyses, this paper goes further to establish that people's political beliefs motivate their media use patterns."
2007-1274,Revisting the Gender Gap: Further Data Analysis of the Gendered Digital Divide in Canada (Top Paper),Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,,,,Work in Progress,Revisting the Gender Gap: Further Data Analysis of the Gendered Digital Divide in Canada (Top Paper),Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,"This paper is in response to calls for individually based, time-series analyses of Internet usage data in Canada. Drawing from the 1997-2001 Household Internet Use Surveys (HIUS) and the 2000 General Social Survey, previous research (by this author) has demonstrated that the HIUS can in fact be disaggregated, after which, they reveal a statistically significant gender gap in Canada. Cross-tab analysis has showed that the access gap between men and women grew between 1997 and 2002, and logistic regression analyses revealed that men were more than 50% more likely than women to access the Internet from home on a daily basis. This paper represents a continuation and expansion of the previous research, and will use the recently released 2002 and 2003 HIUS data to create a seven-year long time-series analysis of Internet usage in Canada, comparing men and women with location and frequency of access. Furthermore, it will create an individually based examination of online Information seeking practices of Canadian men and women. Finally, the paper will include a critique of the HIUS survey design and corresponding reports, and suggest that they have been ultimately inadequate for accurately determining how Canadian women have been using the Internet, in particular with respect to measurement beyond mere ""access""."
2007-1275,Reviving the Picture Theory of Linguistic Communication,(De-)Constructing Communication: Theorizing Mediation,,,,Paper,Reviving the Picture Theory of Linguistic Communication,(De-)Constructing Communication: Theorizing Mediation,"Ludwig Wittgenstein is famous for rejecting the theory that the meaning of an utterance is the mental image you form in your head in response to the utterance -- the so-called picture theory. Our understanding of linguistic communication has subsequently become a highly specialized endeavor focusing on formal characteristics of language and interaction. Recent developments in simulation theory has opened up the possibility that mental images can again be considered a vital component of meaning-making. In contrast to picture theory, simulation theory sees mental imagery as an input system to a set of higher-level inference engines. In the emerging model, the mind's ability to run mental simulations is treated as the basis of abstract thinking as well as the condition of possibility for verbal communication. Complex internal multi-modal forms of information are parsed and translated into basic categories by the speaker, and it is these bare categories that are communicated in words. The listener takes the words and uses them to construct a rich simulation based on her own remembered and parsed experiences. The act of understanding relies on the mind's ability to respond to a simulated scenario as if it were a perceived event. A predicted weakness of such a system is that listeners may be led to make inferences from elements of the simulation that they contributed using their own experiences, without verifying whether these inferences are warranted by the information communicated. In this talk, I present a study that measures imperfect inferential restraint as a way to test the picture theory. Study participants are asked to draw a series of sentences in a story, and are subsequently asked to assess the probability that their inferences are correct. The results are consistent with the predictions of the revived variant of picture theory. I end by suggesting the emerging model of verbal communication also has significant consequences for our understanding of the mass media."
2007-1276,Rights as a Rhetorical Resource: An Argument in Favor of Promoting Clean Indoor Air Policies Through the Use of Anger Appeals,Communication Law & Policy Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Rights as a Rhetorical Resource: An Argument in Favor of Promoting Clean Indoor Air Policies Through the Use of Anger Appeals,Communication Law & Policy Interactive Paper Session,"Debates over clean indoor air policies are often framed as a conflict between health and the right to smoke. Clean indoor advocates have side-stepped the rights issue to avoid mobilizing smokers who would defend the freedom to smoke. The current investigation sought to examine the roles of perceived risk, attitudes, anger and psychological reactance in explaining potential voters support or non-support for clean indoor air policies. To do so, participants (N = 550) living in the Midwest were sampled as a means of conducting formative research prior to developing messages promoting clean indoor air policies. Guided by Psychological Reactance Theory, results reveal that awareness of risk is a good predictor of attitudes and the arousal of anger toward secondhand smoke. Additionally, individuals with a proclivity toward reactance were more likely to experience anger when confronted with secondhand smoke and this anger was positively associated with favorable attitudes toward clean indoor air. Moreover, attitudes are good predictors of policy support for clean indoor air legislation. Thus, discussing a right to clean indoor air or a right to not smoke can become a powerful rhetorical resource for advocates of clean indoor air. Our findings are discussed with a focus on message design for practitioners and academics with interests in promoting clean indoor air policies."
2007-1277,Right-Wing Populism and the Anti-EU Vote,Framing Europe in the News and in Public Opinion,,,,Paper,Right-Wing Populism and the Anti-EU Vote,Framing Europe in the News and in Public Opinion,"Right-wing populism is currently a powerful political force in a number of European democracies and the success of right-wing populist parties is able to reshape national party politics. Right-wing populism often goes together with opposition to the European Union and the transference of power to a supranational level. It is established that opposition to immigration, feelings of national identity and economic satisfaction are factors influencing support for these parties. Little, however, is known about whether the political information environment affects successes of these parties. The present study takes an integrative approach by considering whether and why extreme right parties make it into the news and whether their presence in the news and the framing of their portrayal affects public support. It is hypothesized that the conflict potential of right-wing parties issues and standpoints contributes to their overall visibility, and that the valence of the news framing partly explains vote choice. These assumptions are tested in cross-national perspective, by drawing on a content analysis of newspapers and television news in 23 European countries before the last European parliament election 2004, and the post-election survey that includes relevant variables such as party-sympathy scores, vote recall, and exposure to news outlets. Findings are discussed in the light of journalistic conduct with regards to parties on extreme ends of the political spectrum."

Member centers include: Fox Chase Cancer Center; Michigan State University (MSU); University of California, San Francisco (UCSF); and University of Cincinnati (UC). The BCERC form a national network of four multidisciplinary research projects to understand the determinants of early pubertal maturation as a risk factor in breast cancer. The Communication and Translation of Core (COTC) of the BCERC is comprised of communication specialists, breast cancer advocates and social scientists from the four centers. The COTC is charged with communicating and disseminating prevention information as well as findings from the Epidemiological (EPI) and Biological (BIO) Cores of the BCERC. While new science emerges from the EPI and BIO Cores of the BCERC, the COTC has focused on recruitment, awareness, education, and prevention activities. The COTC holds regular conference calls for continued integration of COTC interests in the overall project as well as specific projects. The MSU COTC has conducted formative research for prevention campaigns, a content analysis of media representations of breast cancer, and a memorable message project with survivors of breast cancer; MSU will also be leading a large message testing study in collaboration with the COTCs at each of the four BCERCs. In addition to these research projects, MSU has participated in and facilitated multiple activities to improve health and risk communication efforts, including: workshops on campaign design, media relations, social marketing, message design, media advocacy, persuasive strategies, and influencing policy-makers, cultural competency, and user-friendly website design; mentoring of advocate research endeavors via training workshops and individual guidance, and facilitating participation of advocates in the message testing study. The UCSF COTC has written grants, hosted science and education workshops, produced targeted newsletters, formed community advisory groups, sponsored town hall meetings and other community forums, developed educational materials, conducted a community-wide assessment, and developed a peer education program for teenagers. Zero Breast Cancer, the key advocacy group that represents the UCSF COTC, is also the community PI on other breast cancer related grants. All of their activities are aimed at eradicating breast cancer and increasing community-based, participatory research into the environmental causes of breast cancer. Presenters will provide an overview of their collaborations within the COTC and discuss new research results as well as the perceived effectiveness of COTC strategies/activities, research projects, and capacity building for risk communication efforts."

And in sectors and industries with a greater potential risk of major damage to the community, as is the case with the chemical industry, it is of fundamental importance within Corporate Responsibility issues, being the basis on which relations with the community are established. Risk Communication can be considered as part of the Community Relations programmes, for communicating risk issues with communities that live in areas close to industries which are hazardous for the health and the environment. In risk communication programmes, the Internet and corporate websites are becoming increasingly more important as tools of communication, and offer professionals new opportunities for informing and communicating with the community. In this paper, a specific methodology was defined allowing the corporate websites of the chemical industry to be studied, analysing how the trade associations and companies present at the chemical cluster of Tarragona (Spain) diffuse information and/or encourage dialogue with the community on issues relating to the potencial chemical risk and the protection of environment, health and the safety."

Television executives feel pressure to provide an advertising friendly environment that, while building ratings, does not threaten revenue by alienating sponsors. Yet because HBO relies on viewer subscriptions, it must separate itself from commercial stations and, consequently, take chances. This paper examines some of HBOs recent, innovative content to establish this theme and argues that the network demonstrates greater respect for its audience than advertising-supported channels by more often giving viewers not what they are willing to watch, but what they want to watch."

Qualitative research methodology was employed. In-depth and brief interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of current and former staff members (n=8) and volunteers (n=17) during four visits to Connemara stretching over a 15-year period from 1990 to 2005. Following Rothenbuhlers Ritual Communication: From Everyday Conversation to Mediated Ceremony, the research found 10 characteristics of ritual communication that were relevant to CCRs success: (1) ritual involves action, (2) ritual is performed, (3) ritual is conscious and voluntary, (4) ritual is not just recreational, (5) ritual is oriented toward a group, (6) ritual expresses social relationships, (7) ritual often occurs in the subjunctive mood, (8) ritual emphasizes expressive or aesthetic elements, (9) the symbols of ritual are seriously effective and (10) ritual regularly recurs."

What will be the implications of nonhuman social robots on interracial relations? Would humanity constitute an effective ingroup in comparison to robots? Specifically, would racial prejudice be withheld in comparison to robots? Study 1 (N = 105) assessed Whites rank-ordered preferences for 15 White, Black and robot computer-synthesized characters. The explicit and implicit racial prejudice predicted White vs. Black character preferences for liking and as ones avatar, virtual friend, and virtual tutor. Among the 64 participants who reported minimal interest in robots, explicit racial prejudice negatively predicted preferences for Black over robot characters, showing a pattern that individuals with high prejudice preferred robot characters over Black ones. To directly assessed attitudes towards robots, Study 2 (N = 47) measured Whites explicit and implicitattitudes towards Blacks, Whites, and robots in Phase I and examined the effects of the attitudinal differences on preferences in Phase II. The results showed that high interest in robots was associated with more positive explicit and implicit attitudes towards robots than Blacks when interest in Blacks was low. However, the in-group attitudes were always more positive than the attitudes towards robots even when the participants in-group identity was low. Thus, interest in robots had an asymmetric effect on outgroup racial attitude than ingroup attitude. The attitudinal differences for Blacks vs. robots sensibly predicted preferences for computer-synthesized Black vs. robot characters for virtual social roles, reflecting the finding in Study 1. The posited human boundary of racial prejudice is challenged. As humanoid social robots become more intelligent and capable, robots might pose a serious challenge to intergroup evaluation and attitude and human societal cohesion."
2007-1284,Routine Misconduct: The Myth of Corporate Social Responsibility,The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,,,,Paper,Routine Misconduct: The Myth of Corporate Social Responsibility,The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,"To whom must a corporation have responsibility? If one puts labor at the center of accounts of corporate social responsibility, business as usual comes into relief as a system of routine and necessary misconduct toward workers. In this light, the bulk of literature on corporate social responsibility is limited in its ability to evaluate corporate conduct. Any consideration of CSR that includes the real interests of workers will come up against the basic injustices of capitalism. We must not see responsibility only in terms of a companys externally oriented benevolence while companies like Boeing routinely sacrifice workers on the altar of profit. The capitalist firm is not a moral entity but rather a political one; it is materially invested in perpetuating necessarily unequal relations of power, both internal and external. Thus, critics of CSR must concern themselves with politics, moving from a discussion of ethics and responsibility to a discussion of justice."

WiFi has become known as a particularly promising solution for providing rural access, as its relatively low cost investments allow local entrepreneurs to set up networks. However, in many developing countries, regulatory constraints have been found to impede market entry. In this study we analyze for three countries in Southern Africa how regulatory restrictions and licensing application procedures affect market entrance. While prior studies have frequently pointed at licensing as posing the major regulatory constraint, we find that actually transparency of regulation and information provision on licensing requirements provide the major challenge to market entrants."

In this study, adolescents diagnosed with an affective disorder (i.e., depression, anxiety, bipolar) (n = 65) and control adolescents without psychiatric disorders (n = 23) were called on customized cell phones up to 4 times a day and asked about their current mood state and media use for 5 extended weekends. As expected, when in positive moods, the adolescents were more likely to choose media they perceived as fun and were more engaged in their media use. Counter to adult patterns, however, when in a negative mood, girls, especially, were more likely to be strongly engaged in using media they viewed as sad. Adolescents with affective disorders were most engaged with the media they were using, apparently seeking to intensify their current mood, whether positive or negative. These findings suggest that effective use of media for managing moods may be dependent on gender, maturation and mental health status."

Stay-at-Home Fathers as Dirty Workers,Expecting and Excepting Work,"While caregiving and parenting have traditionally been feminized occupations and responsibility, increasing numbers of men are taking on more responsibility in the home. However, organizational literature tends to overlook those in non-traditional occupations such as stay at home parents. Even work/life literature, which attempts to correct for some of this imbalance, tends to focus primarily on women and their roles at work and home. This research attempts to both fill that gap and extend our understanding of the identity work done by those in occupations which are tainted, or dirty work. Through in-depth interviews conducted with stay-at-home fathers, a more complex and nuanced understanding of the identity struggles faced by men whose work is their home and children, in addition to understanding dirty occupations and care work in general."

In contrast, present media have a more distinct view. In 2006 German television started broadcasting The L Word, the first series focussing on lesbian women. Considering cultivation theory, especially program-specific cultivation effects, one can assume, that a series like The L Word will contrib-ute to viewers attitudes to homosexuality. To examine the influence of The L Word, we conducted a content analysis and a written survey. For 2 reasons, we compared the depiction of women in The L Word and Sex and the City: (1) The L Word has often been characterized as Sex and the City with lesbian characters. (2) Sex and the City helps to interpret the depiction of homosexuals in The L Word. Results show that the depiction of homo- and heterosexual characters have converged. This influences viewers attitudes in that they become more liberal."

A recent finding suggests that the effect sizes reported in meta-analyses may be negatively correlated with study sample sizes. This prediction was tested with a sample of 51 published meta-analyses summarizing the results of 3,602 individual studies. The correlation between effect size and sample size was negative in almost 80% of the meta-analyses examined, and the negative correlation was not limited to a particular type of research or substantive area. This result most likely stems from a bias against publishing findings that are not statistically significant. The primary implication is that meta-analyses may systematically overestimate population effect sizes. It is recommended that researchers routinely examine the n-r scatterplot and correlation, and report this information in meta-analyses."

Meanwhile, truthiness (coined by Stephen Colbert) is the 2006 word of the year. What is the appeal of satire and trusted names in fake news? How do online communication networks, developed through streaming of video through numerous platforms from YouTube to blogs, create new counterpublics? For this talk, I focus specifically on the appeal of satire. Drawing on my three-year ethnography Rethinking Media, Democracy and Citizenship: New Media Practices And Online Digital Dissent After September 11, I examine the implications of online networks formed around satire and fake news. I screen relevant short clips and discuss findings from our interviews with multimedia viral video producers and bloggers committed to Stewart and Colbert as speaking truth to power."
2007-1292,"Scattered Reflections: The Circuit of Production, Representation, and Identity on Mexican New Cinema Discourses (2001-2006)",Fact & Fiction in Film,,,,Extended Abstract,"Scattered Reflections: The Circuit of Production, Representation, and Identity on Mexican New Cinema Discourses (2001-2006)",Fact & Fiction in Film,"Mexican New Cinema (MNC) is a term which appeared in Mexicos public discourse during the late 1980s after some profitable Mexican films began to gain attention from audiences inside and outside the country. The term is elusive in that this phenomenon seems to correspond more to the impressive effort of film production and profitability in a country economically overwhelmed, than to an ideological, technological, or aesthetic trend. The purpose of this study is to define Mexican New Cinema and to identify distinguishing narrational procedures and metaphors of Mexican identity construction in MNC discourses after the political divide in year 2000. This year coincides with both the change in government after 70 years of one ruling party and the beginning of a recovering, though uneven, film production. Previous studies concerning representations and stereotyping of Mexicans in cinema were conducted before MNC emerged. They form part of general histories of Mexican cinema written by both Mexican and foreign film historians, critics, and scholars concerned with the evolution of genres and representations of Mexicans from the 1890s to the 1980s. Drawing from the circuit of culture model described by Paul du Gay and his colleagues, this discourse analysis will identify the distinguishing narrational procedures and metaphors of Mexican identity construction in Mexican New Cinema discourses from 2001 to 2006. The purposive sample will include the semiotic analysis of 12 films produced by the public and the private sector, and 20 long interviews with producers, directors, and screenwriters directly involved in their production."

It explores various aspects of how young Slovenian and Macedonian intellectuals, belonging to the last Yugoslav generation, articulate their (new) spaces of belonging, and identity by evaluating their Yugoslav memories. How was the former Yugoslav community imagined, interpreted, represented, rejected and accepted, and in what ways has this image of community been re-appropriated and re-imagined by the informants? As it appears from the narratives themselves, my informants identify with the former Yugoslavia as a multicultural space, a civic space that was based on a common socialist and pluralist culture, with its collective myths, and rituals. However, as I suggest, Yugoslav identity started to appear as an uncanny feeling of belonging, whereby that which has been familiar becomes suddenly and inexplicably strange and alien. Furthermore, the concept of national identity seems to replicate and recycle the very supra-national Yugoslav logics it wants to oppose."
2007-1294,Scientific Field Observation of Mediated Interpersonal Communication,Towards a Concept of Mediated Interpersonal Communication: Regarding the Cell Phone as a Hybrid Medium,,,,Paper,Scientific Field Observation of Mediated Interpersonal Communication,Towards a Concept of Mediated Interpersonal Communication: Regarding the Cell Phone as a Hybrid Medium,"This paper is dealing with the special methodological proceedings of our current studies. Regarding the field of our research  behavior in communication situation  the focus is on observation as a research method. In addition the observations were combined with other qualitative research methods to get an image of the subject of research that is as accurately as possible. Exploring human behavior and interaction has a long tradition in scientific disciplines such as anthropology and ethnography. By choosing an empirical method for social science the potential of observation is often overlooked although the Chicago School of Sociology has shown that observation studies can be a very adequate instrument to capture and analyze numerous social phenomena. Scientific observation can be a valuable method for studying current social processes, e.g. the usage and adoption of new mobile communication media. Beside plain description of the (inter-)action itself, observations may provide information about the situation and the circumstances this act happened in. Scientific observation contains  by their nature  one deficit: Observations only afford an external perspective on interactions. The world of thoughts is excluded and in order to this the observer can only draw his conclusions about intentions by indications. The presentation will propose methodological approaches to minimize this effect by adding other qualitative methods like group discussions, interviews and media diaries. The connections and interaction of these different methods will be shown at the examples of our latest work. This proceeding is not to challenge scientific observations as a reliable method but on the contrary shall strengthen this method by improving it.
Additionally problematic aspects of the method, e.g. ethical issues will be mentioned and possible enhancements of the method through utilization of audiovisual media will be discussed. Referring to our theoretical concept of mediated interpersonal communication the connections between the several aspects of the concept and the chosen methodological approach is as followed: Scientific observations provide data about communicative acts, present person which are directly or indirectly involved in these acts and the situation which is the frame for the acting. In a mediated communication situation the action and reaction of the participant is not visible for the observer. At this point interviews and group discussions can open the perspective of the researcher for the communication partner and his environment. Furthermore these methods are able to uncover the feelings and meanings related to mediated interpersonal communication."

We wished to examine under what circumstances online support coalesces and breaks apart. The narratives we examined are reflective of 2 topics frequently discussed on the message board: what it feels like to recover and what it means to be clean. In order to understand these narratives from a theoretically-based approach, we use the work of rhetorical theorist Kenneth Burke. Burkes description of 2 human motives, suffering and perfection, led us to an understanding of how unification and division happened within the online community."

As part of a broader program of research exploring the sociolinguistics of tourism, this paper takes the tourist guidebook as just one example of a globalizing tourist genre. Where others have written about the inherently problematic, ideological nature of these texts, our focus here is specifically on the way language and languages are metadiscursively framed, especially in the content and presentation of glossaries. In spite of the exaggerated claims made by the guidebooks (and their publishers), a review of the semantic fields established by glossaries and the general folk-linguistic commentary in the guidebooks reveals that there is rarely sufficient information  or inclination  to conduct anything but the most superficial of conversations. Tourists might well be encouraged to believe they are becoming global communicators and acquiring a global linguistic repertoire, but the focus in guideboooks remains on the informational and transactional language of service exchanges. In contrast with the common myth of travel broadening the mind, language here is little more than linguascape: a strategic commodity for publishers and little more than a ludic resource for tourists."
2007-1297,Second and Third-Person Perceptions of Political Communication in Germany,Media Effects  According to Those Affected: New Evidence on Third-Person Perceptions,,,,Paper,Second and Third-Person Perceptions of Political Communication in Germany,Media Effects  According to Those Affected: New Evidence on Third-Person Perceptions,"Third person perceptions gain substantial relevance in the field of political communication, where the assumption that media reports might exert negative effects on the voter could lead to a call for restrictions of campaign coverage. On occasion of the Federal election campaign in 2002, a survey among 423 German voters determined respondents belief of how strongly the general public, their friends and family, and their own person were affected by six different sorts of communication sources. Results confirm the perceptual component of the third-person concept (including the social distance and the message desirability hypothesis), indicating that the difference between assumed effects on self compared with others increases if the reference group is an anonymous public. Furthermore, this perceptual gap is prevalent only if undesirable content (like political advertising) is considered, with TV debates of candidates representing the most influential type of content. But in a second step, the data fail to prove effects on the behavioural intention of voters, as neither the support of negative nor that of positive measures seems to be systematically related to third-person perceptions."
2007-1298,Second-Level Agenda-Setting and Affective Intelligence: Fluctuations of Public Perceptions of Foreign Nations,Agenda Setting,,,,Paper,Second-Level Agenda-Setting and Affective Intelligence: Fluctuations of Public Perceptions of Foreign Nations,Issues in Agenda Setting,"This longitudinal study employing 3 different national pubic polls over 15 months between January 2004 and April 2005 examined the second-level affective attribute agenda-setting effects on public perceptions of foreign nations. This study found that newspapers had strong influence on the publics negative perceptions/feelings toward foreign nations, but not on positive perceptions/feelings. Negative media coverage always led to negative public perception whereas agenda-setting effects did not always occur in cases of positive media coverage. This study shows strong causal inferences between the media and public agendas through a comparison of the degrees of the correlation between prepoll media coverage and public poll responses and the correlation between post-poll media coverage and public poll results."

The speech within a speech structure of her address allowed her to encourage her audience to take on the subject positions of the women in her sexual education lectures and see the world through womens eyes. The structure also offered Yarros a great degree of control over the representation of her sexual education lectures, the women who received the lectures, and her own ethos. I argue that the structure of Yarross speech, rather than the content, added rhetorical force to her address and helped her to earn the support of the ASHA for her sexual education initiatives."

Existing frameworks are either hard to apply empirically or do not provide for the selectivity characteristic of the Internet and the (possible) duality of users and producers. By revisiting the dynamic-transactional approach and including elements from both the U&G approach and sense-making theory, an attempt is made at developing this framework. Each one of these approaches stresses the importance of a specific issue, like e.g. the reciprocative images of users and communicators, or the relevance of context. Hence, an integrative framework is proposed by combining existing approaches in a way that levels out their specific drawbacks. The aim is to overcome the still distinct differentiation between communicator and user research that no longer seems to be apt in the age of the Internet and interactive media."

For years, the assumption was that CA was socially developed in an individual (Richmond & McCroskey, 1989). However, only recently has anyone tried to explain why people are communicatively apprehensive (see Beatty & McCroskey, 2001). The focus of this paper is to argue that the individual self-construals and embarrassability may provide some guidance for why people are communicatively apprehensive."

The results show a TPP for a set of entertainment stimuli for both men and women. There was a similar pattern of results for realism for women. As expected women perceived the movie clips as more realistic for others than for themselves. However, men perceived the clips of men as more realistic for themselves than for other men. The influence and realism results were complicated by other variables mainly the race of the movie characters and the race of the participant. In the case of influence and realism for women and realism for men, the latency results indicated the self other differences involved an implicit self-other comparison. This experiment is the first to manipulate the TPP using entertainment. It also adds to our understanding of how people make TPP and RPP judgments."

Past research into diary writing and, later, participation in multi user dungeons and home page production has conceptualised the accounts of the self in these contexts variously as strategic self presentation (Goffman 1971, Miller 1995), a means of self exploration and improvement (Foucault 1988) and a means of experimenting with alternative selves (Turkle 1996). Drawing on face to face interviews with 23 personal webloggers this paper finds the purposes and rewards of self-representation via a personal weblog can be inconsistent and change over time, and the practice can take forms not anticipated by the theories commonly used to explain it. For example self-representation can be a means of creative expression seemingly divorced from reflexivity and, similarly, identity play online via weblogs can take place without a self-reflexive motive."

These two views of social-embodied cognition and digital media, although external to the traditional field of communication, furnish new perspectives for investigating intra- and/or interpersonal communication processes and their respective transformation in the new world powered by digital communication technologies."
2007-1306,Selling Postrace on America's Next Top Model,Popular Culture and Cultural Practices: Constructing Identities Through Practice and Performance,,,,Paper,Selling Postrace on America's Next Top Model,Popular Culture and Cultural Practices: Constructing Identities Through Practice and Performance,"African American supermodel Tyra Bankss popular reality show for aspiring young models, Americas Next Top Model, both reflects and produces twenty-first century ideals of post-feminism, a girl power moment in which second-wave feminism is antiquated, and post-race, a post-Civil Rights moment in which race is relic. ANTM features a sizable number of women of color contestants who are led by an African American female leader. The shows explicit message is that racialized and gendered identities are equalized in the Top Model space. However, all of the contestants, both women of color and white women, are disciplined so that they must signify hyper-raced, hyper-sexed and essentialized versions of difference. At the same time, the contestants must also perform as safe, genteel, and essentially white middle class Cover Girls.

In this paper I investigate performances of racial and gender masquerade in a 2004 episode of Americas Next Top Model. This episode features a confluence of race as costume, because the contestants switch ethnicities with the help of makeup and wigs, and gender as maternity, because the contestants don milk mustaches and three-year-old children as props. ANTM demonstrates that performances of post-ethnicity and post-feminism are always reliant upon racialized and gendered stereotypes and the logic of capitalism. While the mixed-race contestants are showcased as the most seamless transgressors of racialized and gendered identity, as all of the women slip on race and gender costumes, the show illustrates the seductive power of post-identity politics in the twenty first century United States."

These effects are investigated via a discussion of the historical and conceptual transformations of the relevant institutions and through the presentation of empirical research conducted on Texas Public High Schools. Consideration is given to the categories and penetration of commercial activities within the schools as well as the overall evaluation of these activities by high-school principals. This research also investigates the relevant stakeholders, initiators and discourse concerning commercialism in Texas public high schools."
2007-1308,Semantic Network Analysis of Global Corporate Values Statements,Creating Corporate Social Responsibility,,,,Paper,Semantic Network Analysis of Global Corporate Values Statements,Creating Corporate Social Responsibility,"The Internet has transformed organizations communicative behavior, the social system, and perhaps the values embedded within both. Organizations have been impacted by these changes within society, especially related to globalization and increased behavioral expectations. To cope with these external influences, organizations grapple with the question of who we are as evidenced in publicized statements of values. Further, corporate values statements, available on organizations websites, are strongly influenced by internal and external messages within the social system. Results from a semantic network analysis of the 2005 list of Forbes Global 2000 presented an accurate picture of the values of the current global economic system. North American, European, and Asian corporations were examined. Within the North American data, successful organizational functioning predominated with an external focus on all stakeholders. References to moral expectations of society tempered performance-related goals and reinforced the image of traditional American work ethic. The European data also emphasized organizational functioning and stakeholders. Superior performance, future-orientation, and accountability to society, emerged as important components. The data also linked culture, of which values are embedded, to organizational survival. In the Asian data, a long-term orientation and collectivistic dimension prevailed. Harmony and balance underlie all references to organizational operations. Though variations within all data sets appear, they focus on organizational functioning. Attention to the customer, as a value, was addressed within the context of performance, integrity, and balance. With the exception of the Asian data set, with its emphasis on balance, all stressed future, success-oriented approaches. A recognition of internal and external stakeholders predominated, along with an eye to global, social, and environmental concerns."

Since the logos and slogans as visual and linguistic signs are the most recognizable and approachable figures to people whom health campaigns intended to deliver their messages, health campaign planners should pay more attention to the role and effectiveness of the representative signs in health campaigns, and scholars should provide applicable advice in the process of the sign creation and evaluation. Combining both the semiotics and communication perspectives, this paper provided 4 guidelines  accuracy, cultural relevance, comprehensibility and narrativity  that help the creation and evaluation of logos and slogans for health campaigns. In application of these guidelines into prevalent health signs, the red ribbon logo presented a cultural inappropriateness in delivering accurate health information and western dominant paradigm which may seriously harm the effectiveness of international AIDS campaigns."

One song in particular, Nothing to My Name written by Cui Jian (the Bruce Springsteen of modern China), not only symbolized Chinas rebellious youth, which reached its peak during the Tiananmen Square tragedy, but it also signaled the birth of postmodernism in Chinese pop music. This semiotic investigation is twofold: while it analyzes the signs and symbols that emerged in the social and historical context of the song, it also examines, in detail, the lyrics of the song and attempts to explain why it gave an incentive to many Chinese youths to rebel against the Chinese authorities. Very few semiotic analyses of present-day Chinese popular music have been conducted so far. In considering the importance and depth of signification of Chinese rock and pop, particular attention is focused on pop music as a symbol and its surrounding complex of representations and values. For this reason, readers will better understand pop music as a sign and its interpretations of experiences caused by phenomena in the larger socio-cultural set of reality of which pop music is an integral part. An explanation of why semiotics applies in this context and an identification and differentiation of relevant points of view on popular music (using semiotic concepts) are also emphasized."

In order to investigate this assumption, yearly samples of television news items (n = 3373) that were broadcasted over 25 years (between 1980 and 2004) in the Netherlands were analyzed by coders in order to measure the presence of sensationalist features. The study reports the existence of trends toward the application of sensationalist devices in television news programs over a period of 25 years. The study also provides support for the expectation that competition stimulates sensationalism because commercial newcomers in the news arena were more sensational than the established public service news; and because established programs responded to newcomers by incorporating more sensationalism."

It is promising to use them as an entertainment-education form for health education and advertising literacy education. For the application of using games for health education, this paper summarizes current approaches of using serious games for health education in the area of nutrition education, sex education, diabetes management, and etc. Traditional theories such as Social Cognitive Theory and Theory of Reasoned Action are used to explain why the interactive and entertaining features of computer games are theoretically well suited for health education, For the application of using games for advertising literacy education, drawing from the theory of learning and the theory of fun and play, we will provide insights into how to design childrens serious games to teach them various advertising tactics, the persuasive intent behind these tactics, and how to cope with them."

Like most campaign and education research, serious game research typically consists of audience analysis at the most general and imprecise level and evaluation of interventions without any type of control comparison. We propose that serious game research can benefit from using ideas from its content (science) to enhance designer understanding of media and game engagement. Specifically, in this paper we provide theory and data explaining the neurophysiology of game engagement. Further, we offer a research model for isolating the key neurological factors that will predict player engagement."

This presentation provides two examples of studies of the 37th Season. Due to the increase in single-parent homes and multiracial families, Sesame Street decided to address single motherhood and multiracial adoption. In formative testing, children viewed an episode where Gina, a Caucasian single woman, adopts Marco, a Guatemalan baby. While few children understood the concept of adoption in pre-testing, in post-testing, 76% understood Marco and Gina were a family. The second study investigated childrens response to Abby Cadaby, a new female muppet, and her magical powers. After viewing an episode introducing Abby, most children articulated some aspect of her magical powers. Furthermore, children found her accessible and friendly. The studies reveal that relationships and characters on the show are effective vehicles for educating young children."

While a number of studies have found the representations of femininity and sexuality in teen media to be restrictive, unrealistic and conservative, this paper fills a gap in the literature by presenting a close analysis of the strategies by which sexuality is constructed. Given that there is a documented difference between the real-world exigencies of girls sexual lives and the representation of sexuality in teen media, this paper uses Barthes concept of myth and Debords understanding of spectacle to frame media rhetorics of sexuality. For Barthes, a myth is a rhetorical figure that supports ideological social beliefs; for Debord, the spectacle is a system of capitalism that manifests itself via mediated images. On the basis of these ideas, the paper claims the semiological method of myth analysis as a feminist practice. Using myth analysis, patterns of representation of adolescent female sexuality in the 2006 issues of Seventeen magazine were analyzed. The analysis uncovered four overarching myths of girls sexuality in the magazine: the myth of sexuality as a function of body hierarchies, the myth of sexuality as spectacle, the myth of sexuality as a heterosexual male domain, and the myth of girls as sexual victims. The paper calls for myth analysis as a media literacy strategy that offers feminist emancipatory potential."

Results show that the issue was framed as a current problem for individuals and communities, and that sexual orientation (or practices) produced differences in framing. Articles that mentioned MSM were associated with health frames, while articles that did not mention MSM were associated with crime frames. The results suggest that both MSM and heterosexuals were stigmatized, but in different ways. Potential implications are discussed."

Five stereotypical categories for violent females are explored: (a) the technically unskilled suicide bomber, (b) the attack bitch seeking revenge, (c) the failed mother, (d) the brainwashed victim and (e) the sexy babe with personal issues. The paper looks at subtly implied emotional and intellectual deficiencies of women terrorists, especially in the context of their physical attractiveness (or lack thereof) and reproductive history."

While democracies especially in Europe and North America principally draw their normative understanding of free speech through Liberal philosophical foundations, the occasion of the Danish Mohammad cartoon demonstrate nuances in various national mass media practices and media legal regimes that lead to a rethinking of how liberal democracies translate normative theories into actual institutional practices. It is in view of this that this paper, using the various national reports as a backdrop, seeks to map out what may be best described as shades or varieties of liberalism. Within the context of libertarian philosophy of free speech and democracy, how do various national media practices differ from each other? How is the right to speak (communicate) framed within national legal regimes? And finally, how we clarify the ways in which we think of these practices between multiculturalism/relativism at one end and liberalism/fundamentalism on the other?"
2007-1319,Sharing Technology Innovation: Collaborating Globally to Solve Problems,How Global is the Communication Research Community?,,,,Paper,Sharing Technology Innovation: Collaborating Globally to Solve Problems,How Global is the Communication Research Community?,This paper will explore the possibilities for international scholars to participate in a visiting scholar program that is being proposed at Santa Clara University (SCU) in the Silicon Valley. One example of the advantages for people interested in new technologies is the large database at SCU of projects that have used a variety of technologies to solve difficult social problems especially in developing countries. The database is from an annual competition of about 300-400 projects that SCU faculty does judging for. Visitors could use this database as well as contacts with high tech companies in the area to learn more about practical applications for social change. International researchers in communication for development might use this opportunity to develop ideas of how technology may be applied to social problems of their own societies.

Deep Dish's three DVD series ""Shocking and Awful"" is a collection of anti-war voices, including creative protests by artists and musicians, interviews with families of soldiers and independent views directly from a group of young Iraqi videomakers. During the last Gulf War, Deep Dish's Gulf Crisis TV Project was distributed to peace groups and military bases through collaboration with the War Resisters organization and other peace groups. This time there were new tools for this sort of distribution: list serves on the internet, blogs and the network of 500 radio and TV stations which has been cobbled together by Democracy Now. Making DVDs is easier and cheaper than VHS; DVDs are also convenient to mail, as Netflix well knows. This has enabled Deep Dish to distribute thousands of sets of the anti-war series, not only to the US, but around the world."
2007-1321,"Shoot First, Ask Questions Later: Motivations of a Womens Gaming Clan",A Closer Look at Violent Video Games: Beyond the Simple Effects Paradigm,,,,Paper,"Shoot First, Ask Questions Later: Motivations of a Womens Gaming Clan",A Closer Look at Violent Video Games: Beyond the Simple Effects Paradigm,"The increasing influence of video games in consumer culture has sparked curiosity about how to design and market games to a broad range of game players. Current statistics indicate that the latest generation of games and console technology appeal not only to young men, but also to adults and women. Communication researchers have studied the effects of violent games and measured uses and gratifications of interactive networked gaming using various populations and games. This survey of an exclusively female first person shooter (FPS) gaming clan explores the significance of gender on game behavior. Members of the largest womens FPS gaming clan were asked to consider a range of motivations and rank their values/view of self. Competition and community were shown to be compelling reasons for clan membership and FPS play. Current theory and social models are also evaluated for their appropriateness in measuring qualities of games which are significant to these women."

Although more U.S. students are studying abroad than ever before, they are doing so for shorter periods of time often with the same expectations as those who spend a year or more abroad. Expectations for successful outcomes such as the development of intergroup understanding are pervasive, but students study abroad with additional internal and external expectations. Many of those expectations go unmet. Applying Burgoons (1978) expectancy violations theory, I suggest that much of the adjustment stress is the result of unmet expectations in four major areas: Academic/language expectations, social expectations, cultural/value expectations, and travel/cultural experience expectations. In addition to their own expectations, expectations were also placed on students by their study abroad program, costudents, friends/family, their host family, and their home university. In an effort to manage the stress resulting from unmet expectations, students routinely engaged in 9 types of talk (i.e., advice, superficial introductory talk, information sharing, comparison, humor, story telling, gossip, complaint, and supportive talk). Routine talk helped students manage adjustment stress as well as create and refine new expectations and norms for their study abroad experience. Finally, I employ Kims (2001) integrative theory on communication and cross-cultural adaptation to offer an explanation for how students talk enabled them to make necessary adjustments across the sojourn to achieve functional fitness and foster positive intergroup relationships."

However, whether news streamlining has an effect on scientists or journalists credibility is unknown. A multiple message experiment (N = 601) found that both scientists and journalists were viewed as more trustworthy when scientific uncertainty in news coverage of cancer research was (a) increased and (b) attributed to the scientists responsible for the research (as opposed to scientists unaffiliated with the research). This finding offers additional credence to prior qualitative research on this topic and bolsters the argument of those concerned about streamlining of scientific discourse in the news."

This paper examines the rise of devotional literatureday-readers and meditation journalsfor women within the 12-Step world. During the 1980s, three factors enabled such a development: the intellectual inroads of Second Wave feminism, changes within the addiction treatment publishing industry, and the resurgence of New Thought/mind-cure religiosity. I look at the ways that the bestselling works of Karen Casey Elliot and Anne Wilson Schaef combine a feminist critique of patriarchy with the New Thought mandate to heal the self through increased connection to the Divine within or the little voice inside, and attempt to unravel the authors sometimes contradictory assumptions about the healing selfs relationship to the larger world. The paper concludes by reflecting on the technology of the meditation book, which in this instance reinforces the private and individual self as the locus for change."

New Perspectives on Motivations to Play Video Games,,,,Paper,Situational and Gender Comparisons of Digital Game Players' Preferences for Game Features and Gratifications,Why Do We Play? New Perspectives on Motivations to Play Video Games,"As with new media 40 years ago, today's new media are being scrutinized from the uses and gratifications perspective. The new media of interest in this paper are digital games. Research is in the early stages: exploring player gratifications from game playing and preferences for game playing features. This research has consistently found gender differences for both, with, men more preferring competition gratifications and violent games; women, preferring socializing gratifications and puzzles. Past research has mostly looked at digital games in aggregate, not differentiating between game playing situations. This study measured game playing gratifications and feature preferences of male and female players for 3 game playing situations: playing a game they liked, one they disliked, and one they desired. Generally, gender differences from past research were reconfirmed, and game playing differences were significant, with imagined games rated highest and disliked games lowest on all game playing gratifications and game feature preferences. In all, 100% of these comparisons were significant. In addition, 72% of the gender by situation interactions were also significant. Thus, differentiating by game playing situation complicated the picture of with some gender differences disappearing depending on the game situation. At the same time, comparing the gender differences across the game situations showed a tendency for male players to be receiving what they desired from the games they liked, whereas the female players were not having these desires met."

The findings indicate the importance of visuals for the sequence of newspaper reading: Visuals like photos, infographics, and promos are decisive for sequences of attention. The conversion from tabloid to broadsheet which in many national newspaper markets is seen as a recipe against declining readership necessarily implicates changes in the visual appearance of a paper. Pictures have a more dominant role on a smaller newspaper spread, the visual aspect of text presentation (including the use of fonts, the mix of long and short texts, the use of information graphics, promos) has to be reconsidered. Findings of the study show differences and concurrences between both formats in the reception of visuals and their role for reading strategies."

In doing so, we address a gap in the literature that exists between the well-documented patterns through which sports announcers construct race while commentating during games and the lack of studies assessing the impact of this commentary on audience members. Our findings indicate that members of this sample often expressed the idea that Blacks and Whites possessed different physical and mental skills related to sport, including some who felt these differences were directly attributable to race. Analysis points to the influence of both exposure to television and personal experiences in the formation of these responses, indicating a process of audience-content negotiation."
2007-1328,Small-Group Participation and Information: Objective and Subjective Organizations of Task Data,Knowledge and Knowing in Organizations,,,,Paper,Small-Group Participation and Information: Objective and Subjective Organizations of Task Data,Knowledge and Knowing in Organizations,"Organizations often convene groups whose members, by design, differ in their information resources. Task-related information is associated at different levels of abstraction. Some associations are objective whereas others depend on differences in information processing (i.e., are subjective). Associations are responsible, in part, for the activation of data from long-term memory, and activated data become the basis for subsequent contributions to discussion. This exploratory study examines both objective and subjective associations. Participants sorted items from the choose the best candidate task in 2 ways. First, they performed a card sort, manually putting the items into relevant stacks. Second, participants performed a forced distribution Q-sort. In addition, participants completed the Role Category Questionnaire, a measure of information processing. Results from the card sort indicate 3 relatively objective dimensions, whereas the Q-sort factor loadings were not clear cut; there were no information-processing differences from the Q-sort. Discussion focuses on implications for the local management model of participation in small groups."

Situated for the most part in the global city of Bangalore, India, my research turns time and again, to issues of gendered labor and televisions gentrification of rural and urban girls for local skilled and unskilled labor markets. My current work focuses on the role of family and social structures in texturing girls freedom and agency in a rapidly globalizing urban Indian environment (McMillin, forthcoming). A critical postcolonial framework allows me to examine subjective agency as a product of residual colonialism and entrenched structures of patriarchy, class, caste, and religion, to name a few.

Divya C. McMillin is Associate Professor of International Communication and Cultural Studies in the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences Program at the University of Washington, Tacoma. Over the past decade, Dr. McMillin has published several articles (including audience studies) that provide a sense of the vibrant and changing contexts of Indian girls between 13-16 years, and the realities of sexism and enforced labor that some of them face. Her studies have taken her into homes (McMillin, 2001), sweatshops (McMillin 2003), call centers (McMillin, 2006a; in press), colleges, schools, and cybercafes (McMillin 2006b, 2005), to explore how girls struggle with systems of patriarchy and how television and the Internet urge, appease, or distract from this struggle."

Using the theories of Kenneth Burke, this paper identifies and brings together three 'terministic screens' - namely deracialization, scapegoating, and criminalization - and analyzes their discursive and ideological power as well as the 'motives' behind their employment. Functioning together, these frames effectively contained and relegated racism to the fringes of Canadian society to define not only the terms of citizenship and nationality during the arrival of 599 'illegal' Chinese migrants to the shores of British Columbia in 1999, but also foster a narrative that directed public attention away from the national government's mandate to impose stricter immigration legislation in the face of external and internal complexities that were increasingly challenging its competencies, authority, and legitimacy in a period of globalization."
2007-1331,Social and Interpersonal Influences in HIV/AIDS Communication: Strategies and Challenges for Faith-Based Organizations,Competitive Papers in Interpersonal Communication,,,,Paper,Social and Interpersonal Influences in HIV/AIDS Communication: Strategies and Challenges for Faith-Based Organizations,Competitive Papers in Interpersonal Communication,"This qualitative study examines the faith-based organizations (FBO) initiatives in HIV/AIDS communication and prevention in the Caribbean. As social and interpersonal influencers, FBOs shape values and attitudes about family life and sexual self-understanding. Globally, FBOs have contributed in the health sector but there is inadequate research on their HIV/AIDS communication initiatives. Information gathered through 12 focus group discussions and 30 in-depth interviews indicate that Jamaican FBOs are influential entities in their communities with much potential in HIV/AIDS prevention but this potential is not fully embraced in the current interventions. Though FBOs are aware and concerned about the epidemic, their efforts are hampered by AIDS-related stigma and discrimination, myths and misconceptions and cultural practices that contribute to the widespread epidemic. Capacity building and closer collaboration with health professionals along with meaningful involvement of PLWHA would enhance their HIV/AIDS communication initiatives while addressing the identified factors that contribute to the widespread epidemic."

Members of the bowling group Gutter Boys Bowling League in a rural, sexually liberal town of New England construct a particular kind of gay identity through their participation in this social community and through their negotiation of identity along the borderlines of homosexuality and heterosexuality. Based upon ethnographically informed fieldwork research (in particular, interviewing and participant observation) as a racial Other, the author also examines the premise of whiteness among the group members in their construction of gay identity. The study adds localized and context-specific research findings to the current academic discourse on contemporary sexual subject formation."
2007-1333,"Social Capital, Communication, and Mental Health","Technology, Social Capital, and Terrorism Preparedness in Health Care",,,,Paper,"Social Capital, Communication, and Mental Health","Technology, Social Capital, and Terrorism Preparedness in Health Care","Recent studies have demonstrated that the social environment has a significant impact on health, and initiatives are underway to implement policies and programs that better serve the needs of persons who have a severe mental illness. The concept of social capital has played a prominent role in several of these initiatives. However, efforts to substantiate a link between social capital and mental health have been daunted by equivocal findings and conceptual confusion that can be attributed principally to 2 prominent approaches that give conflicting accounts of the characteristics, functions, and effectives of social capital. This paper contributes to current efforts to surmount the polemic and develop a perspective that can more adequately inform mental health policy, research, and practice. It is contended that an application of 2 concepts from communication theory, self-efficacy and opinion leadership, enable the 2 approaches to be reconciled. The significance of this move is illustrated by discussing how social capital informed by communication theory can assist mental health policy makers and service providers in developing the means to recognize the long-term benefits of interventions and programs. Such a focus can complement the current emphasis on achieving short-term outcomes with efforts that are designed to promote health and facilitate recovery from severe mental illness."
2007-1334,"Social Capital, Human Capital, and Career Success in Public Relations in Taiwan",Public Relations Profession and its Professionals,,,,Paper,"Social Capital, Human Capital, and Career Success in Public Relations in Taiwan",Public Relations Profession and its Professionals,"The study examines the degree to which demographic, human capital, and social capital variables predicted career success for public relations practitioners in Taiwan. Social capital includes two dimensions: social trust and social network. Human capital includes education, rank, career tenure, and motivation. Results obtained from a sample of 150 public relations practitioners from 16 agencies suggest that social capital explains the significant variance in subjective career success. As for human capital, motivation negatively predicts job comfort, but positively predicts challenge and task significance. Career tenure and rank in the agency positively predict autonomy, while only age and professional tenure predict objective success."

Focus group interviews at a U.S. and a Norwegian university generated a wide variety of concerns and experiences. Three themes stand out  social connectivity, multitasking, and social control. The informants were seemingly involved in constant conversations with their friends and families. Also, there was a high degree of multi-tasking, involving several activities or media at the same time. E-mail and instant messaging supported near-continuous contact. Their constant multi-tasking could reflect a feeling that they need to be busy, but also an acquired proficiency to handle multiple simultaneous media tasks. For many of our interviewees the mobile phone was used for daily conversations and text messages as much as could be afforded. New media seem to be an integrated part of these people's lives. The thought of being without their mobile phones created feelings of anxiety for some, and their use of these media for maintaining connectivity constituted some new forms of control, even of themselves."

Several theoretical assumptions are put under test: For the first time in third person effect research, a survey of ego-centered networks was conducted which provides the researcher with relational data for every ego-alter relation. Additionally, the typical one-way measurement - first-person judges third-person - was altered: The socially close third-person also judged the first-person. Results show that third person perceptions are related to the very nature of each relationship (e.g. interpersonal similarity, length of contact as well as follow-up communication about media content)."

The study found that when projecting perceived effects, surveyed students saw themselves as more ethical than other Russian PR students in general, and American PR students. Compared to American PR students, generalized Russian PR students were perceived only slightly more favorably by those surveyed. The overall findings suggest that Russian public relations students acknowledge the importance of ethics in their school curricula and perceive ethics as a key issue in public relations leadership."

Through four layers of society, attempting to cover micro, meso and macro levels of social interaction, ICT use and users are analysed with social implications in mind. Paper adapts social theory to investigate roles of ICT in society and concludes that among other things technology should be seen as a tool, as environment, as interaction partner and as a resource. Paper uses several sets of data, combining text analysis, survey data and case study of secondary data to investigate changes in psychobiography, situated activity, social settings and contextual resources domain. Empirical findings of the study are related to changes in lifestyles, communication situations and social and contextual resources of Estonia. Social domains are seen to have extensions in the virtual society rather than forming an independent social setting. Instead of universal technology initiated transformations, paper shows that the changes are related to the individual application and use of the technologies in various ways."

Social marketing is a flexible systems approach that presents itself as a universal communication technology of global application that effectively studies and intervenes in local sites in all their singularity and specificity. The paper will analyze its preferred strategy of narrowcasting to well-defined, targeted audiences through smaller, more community-based channels (now potentially more enabled by new digital technologies) and how narrowcasting provides a technique for articulating (neoliberal) ethical subjects in the mediasphere in relation to projected communities. This analysis builds on earlier work done in a published book anti-smoking campaigns in California, France, and Japan in the context of globalization and neoliberal governance."

The quasi-experimental study evaluates multimedia learning for hitherto dis-connected youth living in the barrios of Lima. We find that technology-mediated game-playing can be as, and in some cases more, effective as traditional health interventions. Further, the research supplements survey-based methodologies with an examination of the impact of respondents social networks (friendship, advice, and co-playing) on learning and increasing self-efficacy."

A baseline household survey was administered to capture existing ICT infrastructure, ICT use, and social networks of advice relationship in four domains (work, health, politics, and technology use). Preliminary findings illustrate the social network structure of the community as it relates to the demographic, socioeconomic, and media use profiles of community members. Further, the study shows how technology availability, access, usage, and skills are related to ones position and network ties in the social network."

I bring into play two central concepts. First, I propose that we should conceive Europe as an intersection of a multiplicity of transnational networks, and the European Public Sphere respectively as a space of negotiation between these networks. Secondly, I apply freely Charles Taylors use of concepts background understanding and social imaginary when discussing the condition of the European Public Sphere. As the paper is a part of a larger research project, it doesnt aim at definite conclusions but it lists a number of issues which will be explored more thoroughly at the later stages of the project."

Experiment 1 (N = 32) shows positive effects of physical embodiment on the feeling of an agents social presence, the evaluation of the agent, the assessment of public evaluation of the agent, and the evaluation of the interaction with the agent. A path analysis reveals that the feeling of the agents social presence mediates the participants evaluation of the social agent. Experiment 2 (N = 32) shows that physical embodiment with restricted tactile interaction causes null or even negative effects in human-agent interaction. In addition, Experiment 2 indicates that lonely people feel higher social presence of social agents, and provide more positive social responses to social agents than non-lonely people. The importance of physical embodiment and tactile communication in human-agent interaction and the diverse role of social robots, especially for the lonely population, are discussed."

Supportive interactions with family, friends, peers, and health care professionals can help develop skills and resources for coping with HIV/AIDS. This paper summarizes themes that appear across numerous qualitative studies of social support for persons with HIV or AIDS. Qualitative research documents meanings and patterns of communication. Synthesis of qualitative findings is useful for understanding, theorizing, and supporting the experience of persons with HIV/AIDS. We describe eight topics that have received attention, including needs for support, functions and processes of support, sources of support, positive and negative support attempts, managing relationships, influences on support, support interventions, and experiences of support providers. We also identify trends in qualitative research on these topics and suggest directions for future research."

Language has often been understood as the carrier of culture (Chiu & Chen, 2004; Fishman, 1977). While there is a link between language and culture, there is still a lack of firm understanding regarding the dynamics that surround the relationship between language, group interactions, and acculturative outcomes. The goal of this study is, therefore, to further delve into the components of social interactions and communication to map out these processes. A total of 218 Francophone students enrolled in French schools in Saskatchewan completed a questionnaire assessing their psychological adjustment, ethnic identity, social support, communication networks, intergroup contact, and linguistic confidence. The results indicated that social interactions with both the in- and outgroup was important for identity maintenance, adoption, and adjustment. The relevance of communication networks and social support in acculturative situations is discussed."

Previous studies have demonstrated that these communities have been used for both the provision and receipt of emotional and informational social support for many different diseases and conditions. While there is a large body of research focused on different individual disease-specific communities, the literature in this field is devoid of cross community comparisons. This investigation marks one of the first online health-related support community comparisons that attempted to compare emotional and informational social support provision across disease controllability, gender, and community member role. A content analysis was conducted on 2,013 messages from three online support communities located in Yahoo!Groups. These communities focused on three diseases that varied in their controllability: Celiac disease, Epilepsy, and muscular dystrophy. During the sample period, a total of 298 community members (mostly female), composed primarily of patients and caregivers, posted messages within the support communities. Data indicate that there were significant differences in the frequency of emotional and informational support across communities. The community focused on the disease with the highest level of controllability (Celiac disease) contained a greater frequency of informational support than the lowest controllability condition (muscular dystrophy). The community focused on the disease with the lowest amount of controllability had a greater frequency of emotional support than the highest controllability condition. In addition, it was found that the types and amounts of emotional and social support were also significantly different across gender and community member role."

Drawing on recent work in actor-network theory (ANT) an organization is described as multiple configurations of space and time, termed a social topology, composed of 4 dimensions: regions, networks, fluidity, and fire. These concepts, building on earlier work in the sociology of science and technology, are explicated and illustrated by results of fieldwork conducted by the first author. The paper concludes with a plea for a revised conceptualization of the dynamic of radical innovation, and an examination of the key role communication plays in this dynamic."

It challenges previous studies treating loneliness as a unidimentional concept, and calls for the specification of differently types of loneliness. Four research questions are proposed to explore relations on sociability, perceived strength of the different social relations, online communication with those social relations, and social and emotional loneliness. Results show that people using more internet for social purpose experience higher level of social and family loneliness. The stronger people perceive their relationship to be with their different social relations, the more they communicate with them through the internet. People communicating with their romantic partner and friends through the internet experience lower level of romantic and social loneliness."

The findings showed that male characters were more likely to demonstrate physical aggression than female characters. Female characters were more likely to demonstrate social aggression than male characters."

NICs, like Taiwan, have been heavily investing in the deployment of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for over a decade. However, there have been very few systematic studies of whether countries like Taiwan have transitioned from an industrial to an information economy and what changes has this transition brought about in the labor force. The high level of dependence on ICTs in the economy and production are two of the most important characteristics of contemporary capitalism (Castells, 1996; Shiller, 1999). For this reason, the influence of ICTs on social, economic and cultural facets has consistently attracted the attention of the academic world in developed countries. However, the specific associations between ICTs, labor, work, wage structure and income inequality in developing or NICs remain unclear (Galbraith, 2000; Galbraith & Berner, 2001) and still need to be investigated. This paper investigates 2 broad questions in relation to the influences of ICTs in Taiwan: first, to what extent has Taiwan made the transition to an information economy? And, second, what changes have occurred in labor productivity, employment trends, and wage structure in Taiwan during this transition?"

Focusing on one of the STP's three independent variables, i.e., constraint recognition, this study examines the effects of participation in computer-mediated support-group (CMSG) communication on individuals level of constraint recognition. Specifically, this study examines communication behaviors of a health-related and computer-based support-group. Research results of the study suggest that CMSG communication has a relational dimension and is able to de-effect the influence of race, class, and gender on communication difficulties and inequalities. These two features as whole help reduce an individuals level of constraint recognition to the extent that the individual may do something positively about the perceived problematic situation, i.e. possible behavior change in the health context."

The other is the poetics of the transformation by which such stories are transformed into allegory. By allegorizing others experiences, we draw our own meanings from those experiences and lay claim to mutual understanding. The work of the distinguished Vietnam War-era broadcast correspondent, John Laurence, compellingly illustrates that, as in past millennia, the attempt to represent war still draws upon allegory to grasp the reality of those in a position to lose their lives - and to take the lives of others. Laurences reporting from Vietnam, which includes the landmark documentary The World of Charlie Company, implicitly reveals poignant parallels to other conflicts including the U.S. occupation of Iraq."

Four pressthe Austin American-Statesman (mainstream), the Austin Chronicle (alternative) and leading ethnic press, including HispanicBusiness.com (Latino) and the Los Angeles Wave (Afro American)  are comparatively analyzed. Framing theory blends with a news narrative approach to quantify and qualify immigration election period news coverage similarities and differences. Broader political, social and cultural forces inform a media sociological approach to news, resulting in 5 umbrella findings. Information Connection, Escapist Tactic, Dichotomies, Uncomfortables and History, Revisited, are chronicles and stories these 4 press tell regarding immigration. Areas of additional research include deeper analyses of reporter and source gender and ethnicity, along with themes of race and class as well as political actor roles.

In this context, most of the tens of thousands of ICTD (information communications technology for development) projects that have emerged across Africa, Asia and Latin America embody novel institutional marriages between private firms, state bodies (at the local, regional, national or multinational level) and NGOs. Drawing from recent debates about the role of the nation state in development and postcolonial studies, this paper attempts to identify differentiated modes of citizenshipbased on shifting rights and responsibilitieswithin the deeply fractured information societies of the South."
2007-1355,Speaking Out in Public: Citizen Participation in Contentious School Board Meetings,Citizen Participation and Discussion,,,,Paper,Speaking Out in Public: Citizen Participation in Contentious School Board Meetings,Citizen Participation and Discussion,"A high level of citizen involvement in civic life is presumed crucial to the well-being of democracy, but the actual discourse of citizen involvement has rarely been analyzed. This article analyzes citizen participation in the school board meetings of one U.S. community that was in the midst of conflict. After providing background on education governance practices and the community that was studied, citizen participation is examined. Citizen commentaries at school board meetings are shown to be a distinct speech genre and the genre is described. Then, we characterize the discourse practices used to express negative sentiment. Feeling-limned description, avowal of feelings, rhetorical questions, reported speech, use of god and devil terms, and using meeting rules as weapons were the main negative sentiment strategies. In the conclusion we suggest when low levels of citizen involvement should be acceptable, and why reasonable hostility is a desirable form of citizen expression."

Pagne motifs are named by women who in turn wear the cloth to communicate information about their views, including political affiliation. In this study, pagne motifs are analyzed using a combination of African feminist theory and historiography to reveal how women have adapted their communication practices to resist hegemonic influences inherited from a colonial past. Women wear pagne to speak out and thus have created a medium of expression that allows for their empowerment. Women's political activism in the Cote d'Ivoire speaks to a changing political environment and points to the tension that exists between the past and the present."

One consistency, though, to the films critical reception reads the films contribution to the social critique of current economic and racial tensions and its classification of the central Jewish character as white. This paper strives for elaboration of this perspective. In its juxtaposition of black, Arab, and Jewish characters, La Haine performs a postmodern form of blackface that works to deassimilate tough Jewishness from mainstream whiteness. By result, this reading encourages reconsideration of the performative spectacle and cultural style of blackness as a repository for proposing and positioning deassimilatory identity."

Grand Theft Auto as Contested Cultural Product,Hot Button Topics: Games and Socially Controversial Issues,"Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games are highly successful, in terms of sales, and their content is part of an explicit business strategy which aims to exploit the latest technologies and platforms to develop content aimed at adult game players in certain markets. By all accounts this has been a highly successful strategy with the GTA franchise selling more than 30 million units across platforms by 2004, even before Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (GTA SA) was launched in late 2004 (Take Two Interactive 2004). The latter was the top selling console game in the USA and in the top 10 in the UK in 2005. At the same time the GTA series are arguably the most maligned of game products in many markets attracting much negative commentary and numerous legal actions in the USA. This paper examines the structure of the games industry and the culture of modding, the global production network of GTA games and public reaction to GTA:SA in the USA, Europe and Australia. This paper concludes that despite the widespread rhetoric of globalisation and the dismantling of state sanctioned censorship systems the censorship of cultural products continues in a less overt, but nonetheless, highly political, socially negotiated and nationally contingent way."

The focus of the paper is application of technologies and techniques, largely developed in the commercial sectors (advertising, marketing, polling, focus group, and other forms of demographic profiling and consumer targeting), in the service of democracy assistance programs. The work of the National Endowment for Democracy and other democracy assistance programs are studied with reference to the Ukraine, Serbia, Georgia, Belarus, and Russia. Conclusions are drawn based on the claims of these programs to direct transitional states toward greater political freedom and strong foundations of civil society."
2007-1360,"Stages of Life: Values, Communication, and Civic Engagement",Youth in the Life Course,,,,Paper,"Stages of Life: Values, Communication, and Civic Engagement",Youth in the Life Course,"Studies of communication and civic engagement note the importance of peoples involvement in their communities through organizations and group interaction. The social capital literature generally says that people develop trust in others through their involvement in organizations, and this is important for civic life in America at a time when voting and other forms of civic action have declined. Media use is integrated into this scenario through its impact on community attachment and news about organizations. The past couple decades have seen an explosion in research focusing on community attachment and civic involvement, some of it drawing on the concept of social capital and its significance for political life today. This approach lifts a set of relationships between communication patterns and civic activitiespolitical or local neighborhood involvement--out of context, as if they were isolated rather than a reflection of a larger process. We exam civic engagement and its predictors within peoples position in the life cycle, using a national data set collected in 2005-2006."

Media drenching, performance, function and reference are new gratifications, which no prior research was found and consistence with the argument of the diffused audience on the Internet. This study finds that staging phenomena is highly related with internet addiction and further verifies the problematic dichotomous gratification structure, process-content gratifications, the process gratification relates to Internet addiction. Along with some research findings, the process-content distinction may simply not be an applicable one in the Internet settings since distinctions between the real world and the mediated world are vanishing which is also the main argument of the SPP paradigm."

In doing so, we first provide a historical sketch of relationship management as a general theory of public relations. Second, we suggest stakeholder identification as a complement to relationship outcome measurements and explain why it links more effectively to organizational success. Third, we introduce stakeholder resources in business and society literature to help reframe and recast organization-public relationship constructs in group and organizational contexts. Finally, by using a recent research at a regional hospital, we formulate some propositions based on the typology to provide specific conditions and strategies for organizations to cultivate communal sharing relationships with stakeholder groups."

In the field of television studies, dealing with the relationship between the electronic medium and the time dimension has meant in most cases referring to the immediate present or nowness of distant events, which viewers are enabled to attend as they take place. In substance it is the experience of liveness.' Life or to be more precise the life strategies, to use the words of Zygmunt Bauman are at the centre of this paper, which draws on the inexhaustible range of reflections aroused by television narratives to emphasise the life-giving potential of their specific serial formulae. Leaving out all the intermediate stages for the moment, the interpretative hypothesis advanced in the next pages could be summarised  though not simplified  in the following terms: the temporality of serialised fictions is the building material for one of the elaborate subterfuges through which human cultures, and in this specific case the popular cultures of the modern world, keep the anxiety about death at bay."

Image Analysis of Women in Magazines,,,,Paper,Stories for Women About Women: Ordinary and Not-So-Ordinary African Women in Marie Claire,More Than a Pretty Picture? Image Analysis of Women in Magazines,"The existing scholarship (Ebo, 1992; Fair, 1992; Fair, 1996; Fair, & Parks, 2001; Hawk, 1992; Hultman, 1992) points to the problems with Western media reporting on the continent of Africa and Africans. Perpetually underreported, Africa still emerges in the media as the Dark continent, inhabited by inferior and irrational people. This paper looks at the representations of the African women in an entertainment medium  a womans magazine, Marie Claire. It scrutinizes if the range of images and narratives of African woman is any broader and/or different in the entertainment medium targeted at an exclusively female audience by implicitly comparing them to those in the news media. Moreover, drawing on Saids (1994) theory of Orientalism, the paper analyzes if Marie Claire disrupts or simply reinforces Black Orientalist discourses. The paper concludes that narratives and images in Marie Claire are far from blatant and unequivocal statements of Black Orientalism; instead, they are rather complex and at times ambivalent, i.e., accommodating ideological positions, but also leaving plenty of room for negotiation."

This presentation describes the development and use of ASAP (Avian & pandemic flu Strategic Action Planner), an interactive, web-based, interagency toolkit, and how it brings together up-to-date epidemiological data and behavioral studies, theoretical frameworks (such as Extended Parallel Processing) for strategic planning, adaptable templates for message and materials development, and communication research tools to address the needs of researchers and program planners facing or anticipating avian flu outbreaks. Examples of its use from UNICEF country offices and how it enhances the conceptual and methodological rigor of programs and materials will be shared and analyzed."

PTSD and related beliefs and behaviors are assessed among African American adults in the New Orleans area. Cross-sectional and panel data resulted from telephone survey interviews of African American adults. Statistical analysis indicates that behaviors to counter stress and depression increased significantly over the course of the media campaign. In addition, the behavioral measure was associated with media campaign recall. In contrast, beliefs about stress and depression remained constant, nearing the peak of the scale. PTSD remained constant, with 63% of women and 46% of men screened for the disorder. These findings are considered in light of health information disparities and health disparities among African Americans in New Orleans and elsewhere in the United States."

It is argued homogenization and deprivation have epistemological consequences that contribute to an impoverished public discourse on matters critical to the exercise of democracy. It is further suggested that the homogenized news product is increasingly typical of that exhibited by media artifacts of authoritarian political regimes. An elaborated conceptualization of gatekeeping and its relevance to homogenization is offered."

It takes account of the change in the role of journalists and the relationship with political authorities and media subscribers. The paper focuses on the case of Xinhua Shanghai bureau with consideration of the unique media ecology of Shanghai. This paper aims to provide a de-Westernised account of the transformations of the Chinese media system as a whole and Xinhua in particular in 1980-2005. It goes beyond the theoretical polarisations in media and communications studies, notably state/market dichotomy and the global/local nexus, which tend to simplify the complex social world. Instead, the paper explores dynamic relations between the national (or the central) and the local in the Chinese context, providing a case study of the collaboration between Xinhua and Dragon TV."

However, when offline rules and structures were weak, less-regulated online interactions established structure and rules. Offline positions influenced the amount of transfer from offline to online. Those with the highest and lowest offline positions transferred offline rules and roles the most. The online communities did offer some potential for reshaping the offline structure."

This investigation also measured levels of relational trust, satisfaction, commitment, investment, quality of alternatives, reasons an individual would not want to disclose a positive STD status, responses to a partner disclosing a positive STD status, and if responses to the disclosure varied due to the circumstances under which the partner had acquired the STD. Results indicated that while students are knowledgeable about safer sexual practices and are concerned about STDs and HIV, always using a condom during oral, vaginal, or anal sex is low in frequency. Most participants reported that the appropriate time to disclose STD status is before having sex for the first time. Casually dating partners report more alternatives to their relationship and less commitment, trust, investment, or satisfaction with their relationship than individuals in more advanced relational stages. Condom efficacy did not vary by relational stage, but condom use for vaginal sex decreased as relational stage increased. Reasons for not disclosing STD status included embarrassment and fear of partner rejection. Responses to the disclosure varied, from negative to more positively valenced reactions."

However, globalization entails more than the spread of mainstream American culture: globalization also takes place at the level of the underground, of the subcultural. In this paper we will attempt to provide some clarification on the relationship between subcultural niche media and Englishization by reporting on a particular case study. We will investigate how the use of English in music programs on Flemish youth radio and television relates to the subcultural affiliations of the programs. More specifically, we will study the varieties of English used by the presenters of programs that focus on diasporic African music (e.g., hip hop, r&b, reggae). On the basis of in-depth interviews with these presenters we will show that their particular language use forms part of their aim to communicate a subcultural authenticity. We conclude that accounts that explain the global spread of English as a mere process of homogenization are therefore rather off the mark."

One hundred twenty-seven high-school girls completed a survey in which they described an event where another girl did something to them that was mean or hurtful. Girls also completed measures of the extent to which the aggressive act threatened their positive face, and the extent to which the aggressive act led them to experience negative affect. Results supported the prediction that aggressive acts committed by girls who were more popular than the victim were associated with greater perceived face threat and negative affect than aggressive acts committed by girls who were equally popular or less popular than the victim. In addition, events in which the perpetrator involved other individuals in the commission of aggression were associated with greater perceived face threat and greater negative affect than events in which the perpetrator acted alone. Contrary to predictions, degree of interpersonal closeness between the victim and the perpetrator just prior to the aggressive act was not associated with perceived face threat or degree of negative affect."

Following the argument that the normatively desirable impact of political discussion is likely to emerge or be stronger under specific conditions, this study analyzes the effect of political discussion on political knowledge and awareness of minority interests with interpersonal disagreement and support for democratization as two conditioning variables. Analysis of a representative survey (N = 800) conducted in Hong Kong shows that frequency of interpersonal political discussion indeed relates positively to political knowledge, and such a relationship is stronger among people who experience more disagreement in discussion. Support for democratization does not moderate the impact of discussion on knowledge. However, it does moderate the impact of discussion on awareness of minority interests, such that discussion is related to higher levels of awareness only among supporters of democratization who experience some disagreement in discussion. The implications of the findings on the empirical studies of deliberative democracy and political conversations are discussed."

This ethnographic case study utilized participant observation and in-depth interviews at 2 distinct times in the recent history of a high technology corporation in the Silicon Valley. Interview participants were survivors of several rounds of layoffs and the same interview participants were used for the first round as for the second round of interviews. Themes surrounding the ways that survivor's communicated about being survivors emerged at each time period and are both explored independently and compared to each other to illuminate the survivor's syndrome over time."

Some authors argue that suspense  a well-understood process in non-interactive entertainment is also relevant to video game enjoyment, because players are frequently confronted with uncertainty about the outcome of a situation while they are inclined to resolve the situation successfully. The mixture of uncertainty and desire for positive outcome leads to the emotional configuration known as suspense. An experiment (N = 63) was conducted to test the importance of suspense for video game enjoyment. Suspense was manipulated by framing a 3D game environment either as location of a tourist walk (low suspense) or as destination of an intelligence operation with unknown risk (high suspense). Video game enjoyment was assessed by self-report items after playing. Results suggest a positive relationship between suspense and game enjoyment."

The output, revenue and world market share of this industry has experienced a decisive decline since the mid 1990s. This study finds factor and demand conditions in Porters model to be most important in unveiling the underlying forces that built up and brought down this Hollywood of the East. The endowment of the kung-fu tradition and cheap labor helped Hong Kong develop its brand name genre action and comedy and win a large audience with cultural proximity. The breakthrough of Hollywood in computer-simulated special effects technology since late 1980s, however, greatly compromised Hong Kongs competitive advantages in those genres and thereby attracted audiences away. In conclusion, this paper recommends a long run strategy of positioning Hong Kong as a regional center."

Nevertheless, only a few regulatory measures favoring diversity have been implemented. In an empirical study the author was looking for reasons for this paradoxical situation by analyzing parliamentary debates surrounding the implementation and revision of competition and broadcasting regulations between 1983 and 2006. This study, using qualitative methods, identified one important reason: The awareness of Switzerland being a small state affected the implementation of regulation to a great extent. It has lead to a policy supporting cross-ownership: Publishing houses, perceived as the guarantors of diversity, were given the possibility to diversify into the broadcasting sector  a step that was intended to enable them to compete with broadcasters spilling in from abroad."

Few scholars, however, have utilized these theories to expand upon current conceptions of dialogue from the perspective of marginalized groups. For minorities and women, their perceptions of themselves must be negotiated with the perceptions of more socially dominant groups. This process can hinder dialogue across these groups. Symbolic interactionism centers on identity formation through interactions with others, whereas Black feminism focuses more on praxis. Explicating and synthesizing components of symbolic interactionism and Black feminism provide a new perspective regarding dialogue theory and implications it has for marginalized groups."

Twenty years ago, most Indian newspapers were black and white and the rich and the famous rarely made it into the pages unless they were involved in political scandals. The legacy of Indias robust tradition of hard news and development reporting can be traced to the anti-colonial independence movement. Adapting to the changing climate of a rapidly globalizing India, the Times of India, the oldest newspaper in the country, has stepped into the controversial arena of tabloid news with its production of colorful city-based supplements that are filled with entertainment news, gossip columns, pictorial collages of the citys elite, and images of scantily clad celebrities. Industry insiders and cultural critics in India refer to this new genre of tabloid news as Page Three journalism.

Set in Mumbai, Indias center for global commerce and Bollywood film production, Madhur Bhandarkars acclaimed 2005 film Page Three follows the story of one young, female tabloid journalist, Madhavi Sharma, as she frequents the Page Three circuit of parties, events, and lavish media conferences. The film chronicles Madhavis growing disenchantment with her glamorous life through her interactions with a strong cast of secondary characters including a passive and opportunistic editor, a prominent socialite, a crime reporter, and two supportive female room-mates. In the course of covering the frivolous Page Three agenda, Madhavi uncovers a child abuse story and wants to do a hard news report for the main newspaper, but her editor fires her for violating protocol. In the end, she returns to Page Three journalism for a competing newspaper.

How does Madhavi Sharma, a prototype of the emerging female tabloid reporter in Indian journalism, embody the tensions between tradition/modernity, nationalism/imperialism, and mainstream (hard)/tabloid (soft) news? This paper will examine the films representations of the young Indian female journalist, who tries to break free from the Page Three ghetto of tabloid news, but fails to find a place in the nationalist narrative of respectable journalism. In the absence of any academic work on popular constructions of journalism in India, the paper will use this case study to argue for a more sustained scrutiny of journalism in Indian films."

The analysis identifies transgression as an overarching frame, but finds less support for a dominant clash of civilizations frame in Arab media. The media coverage appears to legitimize Muslims reactions to the publication of Muhammad cartoons, without abetting the clash thesis as some have proposed."

2007-1385,Talking About Media Content: Characteristics and Emotional Functions,Emotions and Communicative Processing of Media Content,,,,Paper,Talking About Media Content: Characteristics and Emotional Functions,Emotions and Communicative Processing of Media Content,"Recipients often refer to information obtained from the mass media in interpersonal conversation. Aim of this paper is to explore, how and why audiences by and large do this. In a current survey study, nearly 200 students and 200 non-students were asked whom they talk to about different kinds of media content, and which functions the reference to mass media in conversations comprises.
Almost every kind of media content is discussed more often with family members and close friends than with acquaintances. Thus, it is important to understand that media references may serve to adjust personal positions in emotional relations by avoiding emotional conflicts. Furthermore, items indicating why respondents discuss topics set by the mass media correlate with each other but do not show clear patterns in factor analysis. Comparing different analytic strategies, two functional dimensions occur: (a) managing the information flow by underlining ones own position and motivating others to articulate their position (b) managing integration by involving others into the conversation while avoiding conversation about personal and emotional concerns."
2007-1386,Talking about Mundane Topics on the Internet: A Comparison of Political and Nonpolitical Online Discussions in Korea.,Korean American Communication Association State-of-the-Art Panel,,,,Paper,Talking about Mundane Topics on the Internet: A Comparison of Political and Nonpolitical Online Discussions in Korea.,Korean American Communication Association State-of-the-Art Panel,"Internet has made us witness and participate in a wide range of communication phenomena we did not experience before. Korea stands out as a unique case in terms of how general public utilize online discussion boards, to engage in many-to-many communication at an unprecedented scale, for myriad of topics in everyday life.
Despite much theoretical and empirical research regarding what and how people exchange information and connect to one another through Internet discussion boards, such endeavors have been mostly confined to the issue sphere of political communication while in fact online discussions flourish much more surrounding more mundane topics. In Korea, discussions on day-to-day, non-political subjects thrive in terms of variety of topics and the number and diversity of the participants compared to political discussions. On the other hand, most of what we empirically know about the process and consequence of online discussion is based on the analysis of online political discussions. This research raises a simple question, Does such knowledge apply to online discussions among general public on non-political topics?
What is generally asked about the online discussion is if it is interactive enough and whether it affords exchange of messages of certain quality. Focusing on the dimension of interactivity and quality of the messages, this study empirically compares how the online discussions differ by the discussion subject (ideologically-laden political vs. non-political). A total of four online discussions, held in the same 2-week period of time on the biggest portal site in Korea, consisting of a total of 3257 postings, were analyzed. Based on Rafaelis (1988) definition of interactivity, the discussions on non-political topics were slightly more interactive resulting in more engaging talks. In addition, more information pooling took place in non-political talks while many people in political discussion were engrossed with expression of opposition in response to the postings with differing political stance. Quality of the messages exchanged was also analyzed in terms of issue relevancy, the argument repertoire (Price & Cappella, 2002), flaming, politeness of expression, and writing style. The result was mixed in such a way that political and non-political discussions were evaluated as of higher quality in different aspects.
In addition, a relatively more complete understanding of the characteristics of online communication was fostered by showing that how the difference in message subject matter can make difference in communication process. The characteristics of asynchronous online discussion, along with theoretical implications, are further discussed."
2007-1387,Talking Politics on Russian TV and Internet,From the Politics of the Popular to Popular Politics: Political Communication in the Realm of Popular Culture,,,,Paper,Talking Politics on Russian TV and Internet,From the Politics of the Popular to Popular Politics: Political Communication in the Realm of Popular Culture,"This paper is based on the study of political discourse in contemporary Russian media and documents the limited space of the political communications in the contemporary Russian mass media. In the absence of programs giving an opportunity for political discussion, as well as expert evaluation of urgent problems, the main communicative strategy of the TV-analytics is infotainment. It aims to construct a convenient image of reality and to prevent from public articulation of diverse political views. At the same time, this format is used for normalization of ideology of new state nationalism.

The second part of the paper compares these spaces of political discourse on television with Ru-net (the Russian-speaking Internet's segment) that carries some functions of the missing public sphere. The example of the Russian blogs illustrates people's demand for participation in political process, as well as lack of language for political debate. Yet, at the same time government authority enters the Ru-net's space (for example, through questions to the president  on the Yandex.ru) affirming dominant political discourses."
2007-1388,Talk Scandals,Journalistic Titillation: Sensationalism and Scandal,,,,Paper,Talk Scandals,Journalistic Titillation: Sensationalism and Scandal,"Political scandals are one of the most significant characteristics of modern democracy. Transgressions of social norms regarding sexuality, money and power made by politicians are recurrent. This article introduces and elaborates the concept of talk scandal in order to provide a deeper understanding of the role of media talk in political scandals. Talk scandals represent a new step in the mediatization of scandals because they are not only communicated in the media, but also in most cases originate in the media. Media talk forms scandals in 3 respects: (1) First-order talk scandals: The scandals originate in speech acts, and it is discursive norms that are transgressed. (2) Second order talk scandals: The scandal originates in some other type of norm transgression, but during the medias review and revelation, statements are made that in themselves are developing to a scandal. (3) The staging of utterances and conversation is also more generally used in the dramatization of scandals."

The present study examines the validity of 2 existing teacher immediacy scales: the Revised Nonverbal Immediacy Measure (RNIM) (McCroskey, Richmond, Sallinen, Fayer, & Barraclough, 1995), and the Chinese Teacher Immediacy Scale (CTIS) (Zhang & Oetzel, 2006a), in U. S., Chinese, German, and Japanese cultures. Results of confirmatory factor analysis and Pearson correlation provide evidence for the validity of both the RNIM and the CTIS. Overall, both scales are found to have adequate factorial, construct, convergent, and discriminant validity pan-culturally and within culture, despite some slight variations across cultures. Implications and future directions are also addressed."

A discriminant analysis was employed to assess these two groups on linear combinations of six predictor variables, with the results showing that nontraditional students had stronger preference for lectures and computer-mediated communication (CMC) and higher learning motivation than did traditional students. A qualitative analysis of the students expectations of exemplary instruction showed that nontraditional students described exemplary teaching as providing outlines and examples when lecturing, caring about students understanding of the material, and being open to student questioning, whereas traditional students viewed exemplary teaching as making learning interesting and giving thorough explanations."

The first will be drawn from several top-ranked programs. The second will be drawn from several top-ranked campuses where Media Studies constitutes a relatively late and marginal curricular development. The curricular programs will be evaluated in terms of their scale and quality of coverage of global media developments in general; of the issues central to the ongoing policy debates in WSIS and the WTO; of international journalism; and of world cinema.

The relevance of these evaluations is not restricted to domestic concerns within the USA, given the current influence of its higher education models around the world.

2007-1392,Technological affordances and the practices of talk-in-interaction,The Creative 'Affordances' of Communication Technologies: A Discussion Panel,,,,Paper,Technological affordances and the practices of talk-in-interaction,The Creative 'Affordances' of Communication Technologies: A Discussion Panel,"Early conversation analytic studies often drew on data derived from technologically-mediated interaction: talk on the telephone. Telephone conversation brought particular methodological benefits for the conversation analytic enterprise but it also raised a new analytical question: since the terms of interaction were altered (e.g., there is no mutual visual access), the organisation of interaction itself might manifest systematic alterations. If so, what is the nature of those alterations and how are they related to the technological medium? Such a question involves considering the relationship between technology, mediation, and the practices of talk-in-interaction. Recent work has brought the concept of affordances into play in order to make more explicit, and more systematic, the terms on which we might explore the relationship between technological mediation and the course of social interaction (Hutchby, 2001). This paper will outline and illustrate the argument about technological affordances and the practices of talk-in-interaction using empirical data involving mobile communications devices."

In addition to explicitly conscious efforts, structural and technological factors can profoundly influence credibility judgments by transmitting certain cues that trigger cognitive heuristics leading to impressions of the quality of information. Indeed, a great deal of automaticity governs youths assessment of the credibility of information, and younger users may rely heavily on cues to make snap judgments while in the midst of online activities rather than on the effortful consideration of the totality of information on any given subject or site. This paper will explore the heuristic cues embedded in the technology of online media that may be used to form judgments about the credibility of online information and its sources, and thus influence youths information seeking and usage."
2007-1394,Technology as Culture: Social Shaping of the Internet in Korea and Japan,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Technology as Culture: Social Shaping of the Internet in Korea and Japan,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,"Technology does not exist in the vacuum of culture. The Internet is no exception. Many discussions of the Internet, however, center around technological essentialism, if not vulgar technological determinism, in that they assume inherent natures of the Internet and that they predict certain social changes based on such assumptions. For example, there are widespread claims that the Internet is inherently anti-hierarchical and that the anti-hierarchically organized communications technology promotes anti-hierarchical communication, and the anti-hierarchical communication leads to anti-hierarchical society. This internal approach assumes a one-way relationship between technology and society: technology causes social change, not vice versa. Against such common-place technological essentialism in understanding the Internet, this paper offers a context-specific analysis of the Internet in Korea and Japan through a comparative and media historical perspective. This research is basically an attempt to explore specific cultural, political and economic conditions for Internet technology to exercise a certain influence on society. Through case studies this paper argues that Koreas Internet culture and successful use of the Internet as an alternative medium is a result of the interaction of various factors including Koreas Confucian tradition, education system, governmental policies, economy, geography, and civil society that existed before the Internet was introduced."

Or will the new media social networks exist as parallel universes with little contact with traditional public service media? This paper reviews the responses of three key public broadcasting entitiesPBS, NPR and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting--to the possibilities and threats raised by the new social media.

2007-1397,"Technology, Language, Media: Toward a Mixed Semiotics Framework",(De-)Constructing Communication: Theorizing Mediation,,,,Paper,"Technology, Language, Media: Toward a Mixed Semiotics Framework",(De-)Constructing Communication: Theorizing Mediation,"This paper calls for a critical assessment of the theoretical and methodological separation between the question of medium and the question of content in the field of communication studies. There is a need to acknowledge the complexity of media systems in their deployment of technologies of communication to materially shape meanings. Rather than separating the content from the technology, it becomes necessary to examine how processes of signification are created through specific technocultural environments. This paper argues that Deleuze and Guattaris work on mixed semiotics offers a robust theoretical framework for analyzing the non-linguistic processes at stake in the shaping of meanings. In particular, Deleuze and Guattaris insistence on the examination of how a-signifying semiologies use semiologies of signification to shape material intensities into new realities is central for examining the power relations at stake in the processes of signification in media systems."

Dr. Brinkleys aphorism that Radio waves pay no attention to lines on a map speaks to a particular problem in the emergence of broadcast technology in France and the United Statesnamely perceptions of the creative powers and perils of radio as a mechanism to secure or undermine the nation-state. While social, political, and commercial circuits of power starkly differentiated these countries, the traits imputed to, and the struggles to shape radios affordances, reveal shared preoccupations with containing the local, regional, and transnational circuits of broadcasting within the nation-state frame. This paper supplies a basis for discussion of the capacities of new media understood to create, as well as to challenge, mechanisms of identity formation."

A Content Analysis of Popular Teen Movies in Four Decades,Influence of Traditional and New Media on Adolescents' Health Behavior,"Parents concern about prevalent sexuality in the media has always been a focal issue as their children may learn from the media messages, particularly during the childrens adolescent stage, a period of exploring the concept of sex. Addressing to this issue with an emphasis of movies as an all-time popular sex education source, the current study content analyzes and compares sexually explicit content and messages presented in a sample of top-grossing teen movies of 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000. The study also examines the thematic treatment of consequences and responsibility of sexual behaviors. The finding indicates that the amount of sexual behavior exceeded its talk-about-sex counterpart, and more than 60% of sexual behavior cases were overwhelmingly unmarried but 40% in fairly established relationship. Comparing types of sexual content, two-thirds of the samples in the 1970s and 1980s are sexual behavior, but talk-about-sex and sexual behavior share similar proportions among sexual content in the movies of the 1990s and 2000s. Moreover, sexual responsibility and consequence of sexual behavior are rarely mentioned in the sampled movies. Limitations of this study are also discussed."

Researchers and practitioners need to prepare for differing utilization patterns, access issues, and responses from staff.

Such large-scale projects, however, enhance understanding of and provide insight to technology selection and strategic planning. In addition, multi-faceted telemedicine endeavors provide lessons on management, implementation, partnership development, effective patient care and staff training. Dealing with these planning challenges can seriously impact patient results, caregiver acceptance, costs, and other essential outcome variables.

When properly planned and administered, though, geographically distant telemedicine projects can offer extraordinary access to specialists, more affordable care, reduced patient and family member burdens, as well as faster healing and decreased hospitalizations."

Unlike other women sports figures, roller derby skaters are not just masculine females who display such qualities as aggressiveness and competitiveness alongside physical strength, agility, and endurance. They are also nonconformist women who subvert heteronormative femininity through their involvement in punk culture. The multiple threats these skaters pose to televisions heterovisuality thus require different strategies of containment than those typically used for other female athletes. A docu-soap that spends equal time on its characters gaming and home lives, Rollergirls relies on roller derbys inherent melodrama to produce engaging entertainment while also imposing melodramatic elements on the skaters off-track lives in order to contain their nonconformist gender performances. How viewers negotiate the ambivalent portraits of roller derby skaters produced through Rollergirls contradictory melodramatic strategies is a primary question for this study."
2007-1402,Television and Economic News: Rationality and Discursive Power,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,Television and Economic News: Rationality and Discursive Power,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"This paper presents the theoretical approach, methodology and empirical findings of an extensive study of Swedish television news about economic and political issues. In the study, a focus is placed on the news reports of the annual presentation of the State budget in the years 19880-1995, a period characterized by systemic change, marketization and political restructuring. Methods of quantitative content analysis were combined with qualitative text analysis, with the aim to understand the televised news as an audio-visual textual system with specific discursive qualities. The results indicate that these qualities were crucial in forming public knowledge and comprehension of the economic and political processes during the period under study. They specified and restricted conditions of a rational journalistic discourse, while at the same time they were instruments of insitutional power. The presentation in this paper implicitly argues for journalism research to interrelate three types of theory approach. One is the perspective of Habermas, building on the ideal model of a functioning public sphere and possible rational communication. The other is, in terms of democratic potential its opposite, the negative view represented by Foucault´s theory of institutionalized discursive power. The third perspective deals with the specific semiotic qualities of television as a producer and mediator of knowledge, and directs attention to the significant textual features of the televised news, its representational forms and conventions, and its distinctive ways of producing meaning."

Even years later many Americans continued to express positive attitudes toward measures that would target Arab and Muslim Americans and reduce the civil liberties of those groups. This study is an attempt to link public opinion regarding Arab and Muslim Americans to exposure to television news and entertainment content and the psychological concept of a Belief in a Just World. Findings suggest that television, especially television news, is related to stereotyped views of Arabs and Muslims. While Belief in a Just World does not appear to play a role in the formation of negative attitudes toward Arab and Muslim American, findings suggest support for Gerbners Mean World hypothesis."

This study explores the relationship between regular exposure to different themes (dating and nondating) and genres (reality and fiction) of television programming and sexual timing expectations in college women. A survey of 400 women revealed that overall TV viewing is not associated with womens expectations of their own sexual timing, though it is associated with expectations about peer sexual timing. Additional analyses indicated that dating program viewing, both fictional and reality, significantly associated with earlier expectations of sexual timing- for oneself and ones peers  as well as earlier self-reported sexual behavior. However, nondating programs did not. Indeed, reality nondating programs evidenced a pattern of associations opposite to that shown for reality-dating programs. The implications of these findings for the study of the effects of televised sexual depictions are discussed."

A longitudinal panel survey of 315 EA and AA preadolescent boys and girls revealed that television exposure, after controlling for age, perceived body size, selective exposure based on interest in ideal-body television, and time 1 disordered eating, significantly predicted disordered eating one year later for EA and AA girls but not for boys. Findings suggest that disordered eating is no longer just a problem among EA girls. Results also highlight the need for continued investigation into which type of television content (e.g., advertising versus entertainment) is more consequential vis-à-vis preadolescents eating behaviors."

Although hype and synergy have been examined in great detail in terms of business models and economics, this paper turns instead to the interpretive/hermeneutic role of hype and synergy. Using three case studies of new American television programs hyped prior to the Fall 2006 season, this paper examines, through close reading, how hype such as advertising campaigns, previews, and reviews can pre-decode a text, posing genre, mood, style, and appropriate audience before the text exists. In effect, then, hype and synergy command considerable textual powers, gifted as they are with the ability to create a text, and to set the parameters for a text. This paper studies the meanings that hype created for these three shows, and argues that hype and synergy enjoy a primary role in determining how texts come to mean anything. Hence, since people do judge books by their covers, this paper also calls for more analysis of those ""covers,"" and for close readings, audience studies, and production analyses of the thousands of instances of hype and synergy that surround all media texts."

Concentrating on the economics of television documentaries, it considers the way in which memory can be manipulated to signal national and historical differences. This issue is explored through the vantage point of a particular mode of television production, international coproductions. The study focuses on a television documentary, The Fifty Years War: Israel and the Arabs, co-produced by three television networks: BBC, PBS (WGBH Boston), and MBC. Making this documentary was only possible after funding from separate sources had been secured, with the quid pro quo of each funding source being given the right to use the produced footage to construct its own version of the final product. Analysing the production process of this television documentary, the study shows that making the tri-versions programme on the Arab-Israeli war became a kind of a war: a war over competing memories, a war over interpretation, and finally a war over representation."

The media in India has changed drastically in the last decade. Also evident is the transformation in lifestyle and value-belief system. This study tried to establish the correlation between the change in media and the altering attitudes through the use of survey research. Web-based survey questionnaire was administered to people in different age groups residing in India. Mall-intercept sampling technique was tweaked to work in online setting. Along with Mall-Intercept, Snowball sampling technique was also used to collect the data. Overall 75 responses were received. Relationship between variables such as active viewing, viewing duration and values were explored in the course of the study."

This study seeks to address these discrepancies by incorporating time of measurement into the examination of regulatory outcomes and by identifying trait-like cognitive moderators that presumably are involved in the regulation of negative moods. Results showed that sad mood initially fostered longer listening to mood-compatible music but such preference decreased over time, suggesting the merits of considering temporal changes in the mood-repair process. In addition, ruminative trait was found to be a significant factor in how people cope with their sad moods, whereas mood salience was not."

2007-1411,Testing a Theoretical Model of Identity Gaps Among Young Adult Grandchildren,Communicating in Interpersonal Relationships,,,,Paper,Testing a Theoretical Model of Identity Gaps Among Young Adult Grandchildren,Communicating in Interpersonal Relationships,"The current study utilizes communication theory of identity to extend the research on age-related identity by explaining how multiple layers of identity coexist for adult grandchildren. Discrepancies between layers, also known as identity gaps, are associated with certain outcomes. An online survey (N = 183) was administered to test a theoretical model of adult grandchildrens identity gaps as a primary factor associated with their communication and relationship (topic avoidance, communication satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction) with a grandparent. It also was hypothesized that grandchildrens relational closeness with their grandparent moderates the association between identity gaps and the outcomes. Although the moderation hypothesis was not supported, identity gaps had strong effects on the communicative and relational outcomes. When reflecting on their communication and relationship with a grandparent, adult grandchildren who experienced identity gaps were more likely to engage in topic avoidance and to feel less satisfied with their relationship."

A study (N = 47) assessed Whites explicit and implicit (using IAT) attitudes towards Blacks, Whites, and robots in Part I and examined the effects of the attitudinal differences on preferences for computer-generated robot and Black characters in Part II. The results showed that high interest in robots was associated with more positive explicit and implicit attitudes towards robots than Blacks when interest in Blacks was low. However, the in-group attitudes were always more positive than the attitudes towards robots even when the participants in-group identity was low. The attitudinal differences for Blacks vs. robots sensibly predicted preferences for computer-synthesized Black vs. robot characters for virtual social roles, suggesting attitudinal differences between Blacks and robots were valid. The posited human boundary of racial prejudice is challenged. The implications of robots for interracial relations are discussed."

In particular, it is examined whether different forms of news media function to increase the gap in political knowledge between socioeconomic classes. Consistent with findings in the United States, newspaper reading was positively related to political learning. Use of political websites also indicated a small learning effect. Data supported the knowledge gap hypothesis. There was a significant gap in political knowledge between highly and less-educated South Koreans. More importantly, the gap was even greater among heavy users of newspapers and political websites, suggesting that these news media may function to increase the gap between classes."

This study has significantly greater coverage than previous research, in terms of both time frame and country cases. This paper models changes in the distribution of five digital information technologies, for over 200 countries, from 1995 to 2005. The analysis demonstrates that a successful leapfrog is surprisingly rare in the first decade of the information age. Surprisingly, the distribution of personal computers, Internet hosts, and secure servers among the nations of the world has not improved over the last decade. Second, contrary to received wisdom, most of the countries we might label as successful leapfrog countries are actually among the wealthiest of the world. Third, while policy reform in the telecommunications sector can sometimes speed the diffusion of digital communication tools, the overall effect of economic wealth is still paramount. Controlling for other economic and demographic factors, the weight of an existing infrastructure has greater negative effect than the positive effect of market reform in the telecommunications sector."

Absentee soldier voting serves as a historical case study of the rhetorical, administrative, and technical means by the public is disengaged from the physical limitations of the people comprising it. I seek to establish an empirical starting point for thinking more broadly about enduring tensions between notions of public space and public sphere in communication scholarship. Tentatively, I suggest that the topic of soldier voting illustrates one possible condition for civic nationalism: the transfer of the electorate from public space to public sphere through a process of reimagining the nature of the vote as a communicative act."
2007-1417,The 360º News Experience: Audience Connections With the Ubiquitous News Organization,The Changing Environment of Media Industries,,,,Paper,The 360º News Experience: Audience Connections With the Ubiquitous News Organization,The Changing Environment of Media Industries,"News networks expend a substantial amount of resource in providing access to their content through multiple gateways, yet little academic research informs this process. Extant research continues to discriminate between news content, the medium on which the news is presented or accessed, and the effects of the content, rather than focus on the totality of the multimodal news experience. The current research extends propositions from uses and gratifications, the technology acceptance model, and the expectancy-value perspective and attempts to explain audience connections to the 360º or multimodal content provider (news organization). The findings suggest a strong connection between surveillance gratifications and ritualistic media use on attitudes or perceptual orientations towards the news organization; this in turn mediates and best predicts satisfaction with the 360º news experience. The overall findings also suggest a branding effect or an extension of the audiences television news perceptions to the multimodal content provided by the news organization."

Schools from 4 school districts participated in a study testing a 2-part intervention for reducing childhood obesity in 3rd-5th graders in this county. One school received an after-school education program only, one school received a communication campaign only, one school received both the education program and communication campaign, and one school served as a control, receiving neither intervention. Children in all four conditions filled out pre- and posttest assessments of their likelihood to engage in 4 healthy target behaviors related to good nutrition and exercise. Results showed no differences between the 4 schools with regard to fruit and vegetable consumption, dairy consumption, or increased physical activity. The 2 schools that received the communication intervention progressed in their intentions to reduce the number of hours they spent in front of square screens to fewer than 2 hours per day, whereas the other 2 schools did not progress positively in regard to this goal. Much can be learned from this pilot intervention that was based upon social cognitive theory and a stages of change framework; implications for research and practice follow the description of the projects results."
2007-1419,The Association Between Adolescents Exposure to Romantic-Themed Media and the Endorsement of Unrealistic Beliefs About Romantic Relationships,Fundamental Issues in Assessing Media Effects on Health-Related Outcomes,,,,Paper,The Association Between Adolescents Exposure to Romantic-Themed Media and the Endorsement of Unrealistic Beliefs About Romantic Relationships,Fundamental Issues in Assessing Media Effects on Health-Related Outcomes,"Prior research suggests that unrealistic expectations for romantic relationships predict relationship dissatisfaction and marital discord. We know very little, however, about the potential sources of these expectations, among them the mass media. Using data from a survey of adolescents between the ages of 15 and 17, the present study examines the link between exposure to romantic-themed media content and beliefs in (1) the existence of soul-mates (2) the need for partners to intuitively sense each others needs and feelings. Participants reported the frequency with which they watched 75 television shows and read 30 magazines. For each media title, frequency of exposure was weighted by a relationship content score, a rating of the degree to which the show or magazine focuses on love, romance, and dating (as determined by an independent sample of college students). Results indicate that for both boys and girls greater exposure to romantic-themed media is positively associated with unrealistic beliefs about romantic relationships."
2007-1420,The Babelsberg Approach: Critical Audience Research,Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,,,,Paper,The Babelsberg Approach: Critical Audience Research,Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,"If we look at audience studies we are forced to consider, in most cases, an unawareness of media texts. There may be acknowledgement of the fact that audiences of specific media texts, like soap operas, are constructed, but the specific textual structures are ignored. The main focus of audience research is with the processes of making meaning and not the textual structures that prefigured this processes. If we look at analyses of television texts we are confronted with, in most cases, a lack of knowledge about their relationships to audiences. At best, there are only assumptions of ideological effects; crude thoughts about how ideological elements are realised through the systems of representation. If we want to understand the fascination of media texts for audiences we have to bring textual analysis and audience research into contact with each other. Maybe then it will be possible to understand how media texts position both the individual viewer and specific audiences. With reference to television and film texts we have to consider different audiences that perform the texts in different ways in different contexts. The processing of film and television texts by different audiences in different times and spaces takes place in different reading formations (Bennett, Woollacott, 1987: 64). Text and context are inseparable. Text and context are always part of the same process, the same moment  they are inseparable: one cannot have a text without a context, or context without a text (Storey, 1999: 73).
Therefore the duties of audience research consist of a textual analysis regarding the implied audience, audience and reception research, a discourse analysis and an analysis of the different contexts. Following the traditions of triangulation in qualitative research audience studies have to use multiple methods, theories and objects. According to the so called Babelsberg approach of media research the research design consists of four main parts: a textual analysis, an audience study, a discourse analysis and a contextualisation of the television or film texts. The multiplicity of methods, or triangulation, reflects an attempt to secure an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon in question (Denzin and Lincoln, 1998: 4). The Paper will deal with the basic assumptions of the Babelsberg approach as a kind of critical audience research and illuminate this by giving examples of several studies."

The results of this research show that bestsellers in art and culture can be studied as mulitstage processes in which different sorts of gatekeepers participate sequentially and in which success in one stage is vital for success in subsequent stages. In my paper I describe the network of mediators that contributed to the best-selling status of The Secret History in the United Stages. Part of the research into the bestsellers system will examine the role, function and status of critics and criticism in art worlds where commercial and popular aspects have become more and more dominant. Special attention will therefore be paid to the role of the serious press in the valuation of the work of Donna Tartt. The paper ends by describing the reception of The Secret History in the Netherlands, where the book found its largest reading public. Thus, the paper not only highlights the different stages of a bestseller in art and culture, but also shows its strong international character."

Considering that co-production strategies are a new phenomena in East Asia, this paper first attempts to provide a general documentation of co-productions in broadcasting and film sectors in the region. It discusses why the region has adopted a co-production system by exploring an economic angle to explain the interdependence of television program and film flows, especially since the late 1990s. The paper also brings into focus the relationship between culture and economic factors while investigating the driving force behind coproductions in East Asia. Finally, it examines whether the cultural proximity in East Asian countries, which has been considered one of the most significant factors for cultural flow, has played a key role in the growth of regional coproductions."
2007-1423,The Blame Game: A First Glimpse at the Socially Acceptable Causes of Female Fatness,Communicating Identity and Self-Presentation,,,,Paper,The Blame Game: A First Glimpse at the Socially Acceptable Causes of Female Fatness,Communicating Identity and Self-Presentation,"Fatism remains one of the last acceptable prejudices in the United States. For women, weight is a defining, if not the defining, characteristic. Due to the importance and value that society and media have placed on physical appearance, and in particular weight, a woman's weight communicates who she is as a person. Unfortunately, what her weight communicates includes a whole host of negative stereotypes that reflect the anti-fat bias that is deeply embedded in American culture. This bias, according to some, is based on the belief that weight is an entirely controllable factor. This study explores whether there exist any conditions under which female fatness is considered socially acceptable. Findings generated from thematic analysis suggest that while there exists a handful of ""acceptable"" causes of female fatness, generalized dislike of obese women might be an even bigger issue that the overweight female population must face."

The new conceptualization of the child as an active consumer has become a significant source of meaning and value in the transformation of childrens media culture today. A new regional childrens television network, Minimax, with channels in Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic and Slovakia showcases various aspects of the dynamics, dialectics and ambiguities that indicate the growing commercialization of childhood in the region. While Minimax positions itself as a protector of national and regional cultural heritage in Central and Eastern Europe, it has greatly contributed to the domestication and promotion of the brand savvy child consumer. Hungary was selected for an in-depth analysis, where media professionals, media regulators and families were interviewed throughout the last six years."

While many authors have analyzed it for its use of irony and its possible purpose as a defense for Douglasss recent change of position on the constitution, there is substantially more that can be garnered from this oration. In this paper, a historical overview of Douglasss life and career is provided, as well as a synopsis of womens place in society at the time that the speech was given. A brief description of the text is provided, and Blacks Second Persona and a close reading are used to evaluate both the text and audience, with the conclusion that Douglasss Fourth of July address is not only a justification for abolition but also a call for womens activism. Based upon the point in his career that Douglass gave the speech, as well as womens role in society during the nineteenth century, there are strong indications in the text that point to Douglasss ideal audience as an empowered, active female population who would battle not only for womens rights, but for the protection of the rights of humanity.

Image Analysis of Women in Magazines,,,,Paper,The Cancer on Your Coffee Table: A Close Reading of Health Content in Womens Magazines,More Than a Pretty Picture? Image Analysis of Women in Magazines,"Womens magazines are a significant resource for personal health information. The health information plays a dual role by fulfilling womens need for information and simultaneously subjecting them to perpetual advisement. This paper examines the messages magazine readers receive about health issues through this gendered medium, asking: Can popular womens magazine health content be categorized as feminist? If so, how? To answer those questions, I conducted a textual analysis of 148 health articles. I explore how authority is cultivated and how responsibility is configured as either personal or institutional. I also analyze health-related coverlines, which serve to both promise change and preserve the status quo. The health topics that the magazines cover revolve around the pursuit of wellness and thus lend themselves to individual-oriented solutions. This qualifies most of the content as therapeutic feminism, but it echoes the liberal-feminist mandate of womens right to know from the Womens Health Movement."
2007-1428,The Cartoons and the War on Terror,The Cartoon Controversy: Freedom of Speech as News,,,,Paper,The Cartoons and the War on Terror,The Cartoon Controversy: Freedom of Speech as News,"The interpretation of the cartoon controversy took place in various kinds of discursive environments where the local political conditions played a major part. At points, however, we can distinguish broader frames of interpretation that seemed to set the tone for the coverage in some countries. One such frame is the war on terror. This paper compares some of the findings in the US and Russia where the war on terror  in different ways  played an important part in the vocabulary of the media. In the US, 9/11 was in some ways an overarching narrative for the cartoon controversy. Popular rhetoric after the terrorist attacks suggested that Muslim terrorists hate our freedoms. The violent reaction to the cartoons provided evidence of that supposed hatred of freedom, thus transforming the war on free speech represented by the Mohammed cartoons into an element of the larger war on terror. In Russia, the cartoon controversy highlighted the delicate interplay among the journalistic community, anti-terrorist officials, and civil society in addressing two challenges: Balancing freedom of speech and the security of society and individuals, and balancing the right to access politically and socially important information and restrictions on media not to cooperate with terrorists. The crucial conclusion is that the information security of a society should be a collaborative product of all forces involved in anti-terrorism activity, but on the basis of one key condition  self-regulatory mechanisms of the media."

In fact, though, the support given health-care providers for talking with patients about cancer risk is not extensive. The CAUSE model draws upon existing research, identifying common sources of tension or confusion in physician-patient interaction. Specifically, the model assists physicians and health-care educators in anticipating common barriers to effective communication and overcoming them to establish credibility, create awareness and understanding, gain agreement about solutions, and help patients enact solutions for the prevention of cancer. In this presentation, one exemplar is presented, an exemplar that describes patients lay theories about cancer risk and a range of ways in which these notions may be overcome."

The opportunity costs involved with any given strategy, the signals available for employing that strategy, and even the ease of determining who or what is a source of various messages, for instance, are each determined in part by characteristics of digital environments some inherent to the medium and others more or less dependent upon current technological limitations. How are these unique characteristics altering how information seekers of all ages do assess credibility, and how they ought to assess credibility? What are the prospects for helping information seekers overcome both natural and learned assessment strategies that can be disastrous when employed in digital environments? How might the rules of the game in judging credibility be changing, and what foreseeable technological advances will most likely alter them further?"

Image Analysis of Women in Magazines,"A content analysis 312 advertisements from Essence magazine is used to explore how the magazine constructs black womanhood. A comparison was made between changing images in 1985 and 2005. Findings show that womens roles and social relationship have been redefined to indicate a more independent woman in the new millennium but thin and athletic models continue to dominate advertisements. Brown-skinned models are still predominant but unlike the mainstream media, there is more use of curvaceous models. The range of products advertised to the black female consumer has expanded in the new millennium but only minimally with the majority of products continuing to be personal care and fashion. A significant drop in alcohol and cigarette ads was evident. As such, there have been some positive changes but the definition of black womens beauty is still constrained by the dominant culture."

By textual analysis of the American-born Taiwanese singer Leehom Wangs latest two albums, Shangri-La and Heroes of Earth, which he labels as chinked-out music, and the related media reports, this study aims at uncovering the meanings underlying the music, focusing on the construction and reconstruction of the Chineseness in Wangs Chinese hip-hop. It examines how the hip-hop music style has been transformed into a new one with strong Chinese roots. Through the analysis of the lyrics, particularly the rap part, the music video of two theme songs, and the media coverage about Wang and his two albums, it has been found that through incorporating the traditional and ethnic Chinese cultural elements, this music style has eliminated the original negative meaning attached to chink, and constructed a more positive image of China and Chinese culture as well as the Chinese identity of the singer himself."

Media Pluralism in European Regulatory Policies,Broadcasting: Public Service Meets New Technologies,"Undisputed merits, but also an interpretational richness of meanings and constitutive vagueness of media pluralism provide for significant flexibility in a way how the concept itself is being used in formulation of policy objectives and rationales, as well as in policy implementation. The proposed contribution aims at the conceptual analysis of media pluralism as it has been used and operationalised in European regulatory policies. It will argue that problematisation of media pluralism stems from two different standards of rationality (cutting across geopolitical divisions), and that it has the implication for the historical development and the structural logic of media systems."

Through analyzing 359 pictures involved in the Think Different campaign, the research reveals 2 stages during the clustering. Initially, Apple Computer conservatively adopted the images of people who were widely respected in the mainstream society. This practice not only exalted the users by having them identify with the celebrities in the picture frames, but also utilized the established reputations of these people to justify the brand of Apple. In the second stage, more unconventionality, especially more pornography, characterized the new images. In addition, by providing some of the images not as subjects, but as sexual objects, audiences were encouraged to Think Different as they view the ads. Thus, they were likely to identify themselves as a subject directly from outside the picture frames. The 2 transitions, the appearance of unconventional images and the transference of the identification position, marked the change of the visual brand. It is proposed that the simplicity of the slogan of Think Different contributed to the sustainable development of the clustering of the visual brand, as it left broad latitude for both the advertisers and the audiences."

Recently, community coalitions have grown in size, scope, and popularity. Despite this growth, little is known about the ubiquitous role communication plays in the creation of community coalition visions. This study examines how members of a community coalition have converged around a shared vision and how this vision has affected group sustenance. The fantasy theme analysis methodology provides a foundation for identifying two distinct visions which are in competition with one another. Findings provide a communicative description of the groups symbolic life coupled with a practical look into group effectiveness."

The use of personal WebPages, blogging sites and social networking sites has just recently become a part of the culture and vocabulary of interviewing and networking for personal and professional purposes. The goal of this research is to expand the application of impression management and self-presentation to social networking sites. Imitation Facebook pages were constructed based on the life of either a male or female participant, each being of average appeal. In a 3x3 factorial experiment, study participants (N = 167) viewed a Facebook page of a user with either a high, medium or low number of friends. The person they were viewing was represented with either a picture, video or text-only. This study found that the model Facebook user was perceived as being more popular, attractive, and self-confident when their social network includes a large (as opposed to small) number of friends. Conversely, the modality of representation did not affect participants perceptions of the model user. Findings are discussed in the context of the literature on impression management, basking in reflected glory and self presentation, and open up new doors for designers and users to consider when constructing these virtual images of themselves and others."
2007-1438,The Complexity of Media Power: Rethinking Generalization and Causality in Qualitative Audience Research,Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,,,,Paper,The Complexity of Media Power: Rethinking Generalization and Causality in Qualitative Audience Research,Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,"In the pioneering days of qualitative audience research, the field was developed in a dual reaction against the reductionist generalizations of quantitative audience research, and its simplifying transformations of correlations between variables into linear cause-and-effect relationships (Hall 1973, Ang 1991, Hermes 1995). The paper traces and discusses the gradual turn in qualitative audience research over the last decade towards a rehabilitation of qualitative generalization and an explicit theorising of the possible causal power relations between media and audiences/publics. Methodologically, numerous scholars have addressed the problem of generality in qualitative audience research and the need for generalization in cross-cultural comparative research (Livingstone 2003, Halkier 2003, Eriksson 2006, Schrøder 2004, Barker 2003). Theoretically, scholars have addressed the issue of power, avoiding reductionism by insisting on ""a centrifugal model of media power"" (Ruddock 2006) or demonstrating how one can ""complexify media power"" by analysing the interplay of media and audience discourses (Schrøder and Phillips, in press). These theoretical and methodological trends are discussed with particular reference to recent research about mediated citizenship that illuminates processes of civic agency (Dahlgren 2006) and the notion of cultural citizenship (Couldry 2006, Jeffrey P. Jones 2006), stressing the need to ""complicate both notions of citizenship and mediation"" (Wahl-Jorgensen 2006). The paper asks how qualitative methods can retain a sense of situated complexity while also enabling us to discern patters and general tendencies in the citizens' mediated political practices? And considering 'critical realist' attempts to take the further step of discerning causal 'generative mechanisms', the paper proposes a qualitative research agenda where causal mechanisms are conceptualized as a relatively open and contingent dynamics."
2007-1439,The Creation of Character Attachment in Role Playing Games,Gaming 2.0: Researching the Active User,,,,Paper,The Creation of Character Attachment in Role Playing Games,Gaming 2.0: Researching the Active User,"Online role playing games (RPGs) remain a growing area of the video game industry, in part due to the attractiveness of the ability to create and manipulate virtual characters (avatars) in a virtual world. The impacts of this ability range from simply more time spent playing online RPGs to greater enjoyment of game-playing. Since the majority of online RPGs are character-centered, the concept of character attachment  the level of perceived affective and cognitive connection felt by a video game player toward a video game character containing dimensions of parasocial interaction, identification, suspension of disbelief, control and responsibility  becomes an important aspect in understanding online RPG experiences. An online questionnaire was used to collect data on character attachment, player motivations, time spent playing, enjoyment, state self-esteem, and addiction. We hypothesize that the latter four constructs can be predicted by levels of character attachment moderated by player motivations."

This study considers how different online news formats can affect the perceived credibility of a news medium. Three news mediums were considered: online newspaper, journalist blog, nonjournalist blog. Using an experiment, the researchers studied the effects of media use, media dependency, and political interest on the perceived credibility of a news medium. This study also discusses whether exposure to a medium that is primarily institutional is perceived as more or less credible than a news medium that appears more individualistic. Results showed that media use, dependency, and political interest were not significant predictors of credibility, but the nonjournalist blog was found significantly more credible than the other 2 mediums. The significance might be explained by the nonjournalists blog unattachment to an institution."

The 20th century offered several examples of the potential ways in which media could act as a conduit for communication between international actors, at times even encouraging peaceful resolution to rising international tensions. The case of the Danish cartoon affair offers an example of how media have failed to fulfill these goals, and in fact made cross-cultural dialogue more difficult. This paper explores the role of media at three levels of the affair  the initiation of the controversy by Jyllands-Posten, the varied media involved in the dissemination of information about the cartoons and the reactions and spectacle they sparked, and the uses of new media to organize and respond to the controversy  in an effort to better situate the role of media and global news flow in international politics. Drawing from a broad range of theories of media power, this paper will contextualize the relationship between the individual, community, and media systems at each phase of the controversy, and offer analytic insight into the nature and reasoning for different ranges of dependence on media systems at different stages in the affair. The paper concludes by arguing that the Danish cartoon affair demonstrates how easily contemporary media actors can contribute to a failure in deliberative cross-cultural discussions regarding issues of public importance."
2007-1442,The Death of Cultural Imperialism -- And Power Too?,"Discourse, Power, and Society",,,,Paper,The Death of Cultural Imperialism -- And Power Too?,"Discourse, Power, and Society","A condensed chapter from a recently published dissertation, this paper critically examines selected texts taken from a pool of 275 accounts of the global rise of English published from Jan. 1, 1991 to May 1, 2003 in five American-owned prestige press publications--the Los Angeles Times, the International Herald Tribune, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. In particular, it interrogates representations that declare the death of cultural imperialism. I deconstruct and problematize these representations along a number of theoretical and analytical lines. I note, and challenge, a powerful propensity toward conceiving of globalization exclusively through the lens of cultural consumption, contending that to focus on cultural consumption and creative appropriation, and to use loosely the catchphrase ""cultural flow,"" is to lose sight of the specific, and considerable, cultural production and distribution inequities that characterize the contemporary global social order. I also challenge a valorization of individual agency in the texts, as well as a bottom-up view of globalization that implies the disintegration of global power differentials."

We offer a perspective that seeks to frame CSR in a more expansive temporal and less elite Western-centric frame. Toward this end, we begin with a brief review of Enron and discuss what a global CSR perspective might have told us about Enron long before this decades debacle. We then explore how a global perspective enables us to see the ways in which the development of the CSR movement mirrors (as well as builds upon) the evolution of the global human rights regime. Like the development of international human rights standards and norms, which, we suggest, are integral to corporate global social responsibility, there are several generations of CSR through which we may explore how to construct and enact more humane and ethical organizational practices."
2007-1444,The Descent: Feminism and the Final Girl in Horror Cinema,Feminine Contradictions and the Politics of Mediated Ambivalence,,,,Paper,The Descent: Feminism and the Final Girl in Horror Cinema,Feminine Contradictions and the Politics of Mediated Ambivalence,"Carol Clovers work on the final girl in horror cinema has become so ubiquitous and acknowledged that even Nike used her as a figure of female strength in their 2000 ad campaign. Yet, the evolution of this figure from her introduction in 70s slasher films, to her self-reflexive nod in the Scream films, and on to contemporary horror films such as Neil Marshalls The Descent (2005) suggests that her role in popular culture is marked by contradiction. The final girls empowerment usually comes at the price of her sanity, and this disintegration points to anxieties surrounding contemporary femininity and female representations of strength. Marshalls film, which focuses on a group of all-female spelunkers exploring the bowels of a monstrous cave, epitomizes the simultaneous pleasures and disappointments that this female icon represents. This paper closely analyzes how the final girlthen and nowintersects with contemporary feminist and postfeminist discourses."
2007-1445,The Dialectical Image of Celebrity,"Celebrities, Representation, and Politics",,,,Paper,The Dialectical Image of Celebrity,"Celebrities, Representation, and Politics","This paper takes Walter Benjamins concept of the dialectical image and applies it to the contemporary trend toward celebrity-based reality television. Marketed by VH1 as Celebreality, these shows such as The Surreal Life, Celebrity Fit Club, and Hogan Knows Best recycle famous figures from the past, presenting them in ostensibly real life situations. As powerful commodities of the culture industry, the images of celebrities are an important part of maintaining the glamour and mystique of mainstream film and television. In celebrity-based reality television, however, these subjects are asked to diet, be in talent shows, and perform manual labor. Following Benjamins theory about the emancipatory potential resulting from contradictions embedded in the commodity form, I argue that the celebrity image presented in current reality television offers a site of resistance from which one can interrogate the hegemony of corporate media structures."

To examine the diffusion of this form across geographic space, new data from an unstudied region of England is compared to other British English data as well as studies from other English-speaking countries. This features grammaticalization among English varieties and its cross-linguistic polysemy indicates that be likes geographic diffusion, rather than a case of linear-progression patterning after American media, is a result of both the linguistic tendencies of the word itself, and the social interaction which makes this linguistic tendency possible. Be like is a strong quotative because its ambiguity puts speakers in the position to make a claim without committing to pure word-for-word content."

In this case, the paper deals with the transformations that have affected the role of the journalist, especially the taking on of new tasks and functions. Following an introduction that describes the theoretical and methodological framework for the research, the article describes the main trends observed within Catalan radio and television companies, news agencies, and online media. The article also presents a series of reflections on polyvalence, reskilling and other processes that affect information professionals. Finally, a classification is proposed of the forms of journalistic polyvalence in the information media."
2007-1448,The Discreet Charm of Foreigners: Anonymous Sources and International News,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Discreet Charm of Foreigners: Anonymous Sources and International News,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"A content analysis of 188 stories submitted to the annual contest of Investigative Reporters and Editors found that those involving some international reporting had the highest frequency of anonymous sources. Half of the analyzed stories were winning entries, and the rest represented a sample constructed to match the winners. The high frequency of anonymous sources in international stories held through across both the winners and the nonwinners. Contrary to expectations from the literature, domestic stories about government, politics, and the military did not use anonymous sources with significantly higher frequency that the other categories. The findings suggest that American investigative reporters are perhaps more likely to grant anonymity to foreigners than to U.S. government officials and American sources in general."
2007-1449,"The Dispassion of Media: Television, Violence, and Everyday Emotions",Affect in Public Life: Mediating Conflict and Terrorism,,,,Paper,"The Dispassion of Media: Television, Violence, and Everyday Emotions",Affect in Public Life: Mediating Conflict and Terrorism,"Many analyses of emotional responses to media, and medias performance of emotion, focus on intense forms of affect. This preference can be particularly marked with representations of violent conflict, war and terrorism. Such a combination of great suffering and overwhelming emotion is encapsulated by the traditional meanings of passion, and given the extremity of depicted events and experiences, it seems almost natural to look for strong, overt, emotional triggers and responses. In contrast to such approaches, this paper explores types of dispassionate, non-intense emotional work performed by banal representations of everyday social networks. Based on the analysis of Israeli television coverage of suicide bombings between 2001-4, it argues that even during the reporting of violence and extreme suffering, media consistently produce a taken-for-granted ground of referential, textual and interactional coherence which invokes ordinary social connectivity and emotional responses. It is against this affective-connective background, and in complex relation to it, that strong passions emerge."

The measure is based on the information-theoretic concept of entropy and is appropriate for those networks in which traffic flows over paths and propagates by means of transference. Tables of critical values are developed which allow the researcher to conduct tests of significance.
2007-1451,The Diversity of Self: Media Diversity and Identity,Media Depictions and Identity,,,,Paper,The Diversity of Self: Media Diversity and Identity,Media Depictions and Identity,"Identity is understood in diversity studies and policy as a fixed, stable attribute that can be approached objectively by looking at social-demographic categorisations. This view conflicts with recent thinking on identity, where identity is understood as unstable and fragmentary. Based on a qualitative analysis of 202 online columns, this paper examines the relation between media diversity and identity. The analysis shows that authors construct different identities at different times. The social-demographic characteristics of the authors do not predict their constructed identities. The paper ends by discussing the implications for media diversity in terms of choice, access, and reflection. It claims that the fragmented and temporary nature of identities calls for diversity assessments to be based on actual constructed or voiced identities in media texts."

It further argues that the sides of the controversy represent competing ideologies within country music that have been present since the genres inception; however the popular media construction of a polarized America  divided between red states and blue states  perpetuated the myth that the genre represents a monolithic, grassroots conservative political ideology. The result of this uncritical mislabeling of country music as the official soundtrack of Bush-supporting conservatives lives was that Maines comments were perceived to be anti-red state, elitist and anti-country music, as opposed to anti-Bush or anti-war. Finally, the author questions the future salience of red-state, blue state news frame and calls for more critical analysis of journalists and politicians use of the Culture Wars construct."

This study of vote choice and the campaign combines a content analysis of national newspapers and television news shows (N= 8395) with panel survey data (N= 1379). It investigates which factors influenced the intention to vote NO in the referendum prior to the campaign as well as the impact of campaign and media variables on the final vote choice. Results reveal that prior to the actual start of the campaign general skepticism towards the EU, disapproval of the incumbent government and feelings of national identity were the strongest determinants for the intention to vote NO in the referendum. The campaign was marked by a high degree of volatility with a considerable amount of voters changing from one side to the other over the course of the campaign. The referendum topic was highly visible in the news with a consistently positive tone towards the Constitution. In this context, higher levels of exposure to referendum news increased the likelihood of voters to switch over to the YES side. Despite the overall positive news environment many voters were cynical about the campaign as such which contributed to a NO vote."

Using an experimental design, 240 children (the experimental group) watched 10 episodes of Sisimpur over 20 days, and another 240 children (the control group) viewed an animated series, Tom and Jerry. Children in both groups were tested on a range of skills before and after exposure. These included vocabulary, numeracy, cognitive skills, cultural knowledge (e.g., knowledge of musical instruments, festivals, etc.), and life skills (e.g., sharing, oral health hygiene, recognizing disability). Analyses showed that watching Sisimpur was associated with better vocabulary skills, counting ability, cognitive skills, and cultural knowledge and life skills. While more research is needed to determine the series impact in naturalistic settings, the results of this study indicate that Sisimpur can be a beneficial educational vehicle for young Bangladeshi children."

Specifically, we predicted that: (a) direct communication about uncertainty decreases subsequent perceptions of self, partner, and relationship uncertainty; (b) the magnitude of change in relational uncertainty corresponds with increased intimacy; and (c) direct communication about uncertainty increases subsequent perceptions of relational intimacy, above and beyond the effect of decreased relational uncertainty. To test these predictions, we used multilevel modeling to analyze longitudinal data that was collected from individuals in romantic associations over a period of 6 weeks. The results fully supported our hypotheses. We discuss our findings in relation to research on uncertainty reduction and relationship development."

The current study tested these contextual assumptions at an automatic level by examining the effects of emotional presentation context on recognition for emotional images. High-valence, low-arousal target images were embedded into a stream of similarly or dissimilarly valanced images. Results indicated a significant effect of presentation context valance on both speed and accuracy of target image recognition. Images presented in negative contexts, regardless of target image valance, were significantly more quickly and more accurately recognized than images presented in positive or neutral contexts. These results imply that presentation context valance has a greater effect on recognition memory than the valance of target images themselves, and opens the door for future context-based studies of emotional processing."
2007-1457,The Effect of Imperative Mood Position Statements on Attitude Change in Associative Networks,formation Systems Interactive High-Density: Processing Persuasive Messages,,,,Extended Abstract,The Effect of Imperative Mood Position Statements on Attitude Change in Associative Networks,Information Systems Interactive High-Density: Processing Persuasive Messages,"The study examines the effect of imperative mood position statements (IMPS) on attitude change, the strength of associations in attitude hierarchies, and response latency. The results of 2 pilot studies (N = 204 and N = 88) indicated that premessage attitudes were organized hierarchically. In the main study, participants at a large eastern university (N = 136) were exposed to IMPS or a distraction task in a pretest-posttest control group design. Topic familiarity and involvement were also manipulated in the design, with respondent gender as a control variable. Attitude change toward topic was predicted by information processing theory. Results indicated that IMPS amplified the effect of message discrepancy on attitudes for the unfamiliar but not for the familiar topic. The size of the discrepancy effects was diminished by counterarguing. The relationship among the secondary attitudes was modeled separately for the 2 topics. Results indicate that activation of the attitude network by the pretest disintegrated the strength of the relationships among the attitudes whereas exposure to IMPS increased the strength of the hierarchical associations, leading to enhanced integration. A causal model was developed to link knowledge, involvement, and attitudes premessage and postmessage, for both the target attitude and on attitudes in the attitude hierarchy. Involvement, gender, and familiarity moderated IMPS effects. Exposure to IMPS had no effect on response latency, providing further evidence against mere thought interpretations of IMPS effects. Implications of the results for information processing theory, Tessers mere thought paradigm, and advertising are discussed."

The current research revisited the actor-observer bias by varying the outcome of behaviors (success versus failure), relationship between attribution makers and actors (stranger, self, versus friend), and levels of involvement (high involvement versus low involvement). A nested design was conducted with experimental sessions nested within session type and involvement. Relationship was expected to have a main effect on attributions and interact with behavioral outcomes to influence attributions as well. In addition, a 2-way interaction was hypothesized between behavioral outcome and involvement. Furthermore, 2 research questions were proposed regarding the interaction effect of relationship and involvement and the three-way interaction on attributions. Results indicated that relationship and involvement interacted to affect peoples dispositional attributions. In addition, a significant three-way interaction related to internal attributions was found. No significant results were found for external attributions. Uninvolved friend observers made more dispositional attributions to actors success, whereas involved stranger observers made more internal attributions to actors failure. Results provided further support to Jones and Nisbetts proposition of the actor-observer bias."
2007-1459,The Effect of Late-Night TV Comedy Viewing on Adolescents Civic Participation: Political Efficacy as a Mediating Mechanism,Top 4 Student Papers in Mass Communication,,,,Paper,The Effect of Late-Night TV Comedy Viewing on Adolescents Civic Participation: Political Efficacy as a Mediating Mechanism,Top 4 Student Papers in Mass Communication,"Political pundits, parents, and scholars alike have expressed concern about youth attention to late-night political comedy shows, such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, suggesting that such viewing is deleterious for an active and efficacious citizenry. At the same time, as civic participation declines among adults, it appears to be growing among adolescents. This study assessed the effects of various types of television viewing on civic participation among high school students in a midwestern U.S. urban school district. Results demonstrate that viewing late-night TV had a positive and significant effect on civic participation, and this relationship was mediated by political efficacy. The same did not hold true for viewing national or local TV news. Moreover, viewing these late-night shows was not correlated with political cynicisma relationship found in previous studies. Implications for the study of late-night TV content and further applications to the study of political socialization are discussed."
2007-1460,The Effect of Marijuana Scenes in Antimarijuana Public Service Announcements on Adolescents Evaluation of Ad Effectiveness,"A Tale of Three Vices: Communication About Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol to Adolescents",,,,Paper,The Effect of Marijuana Scenes in Antimarijuana Public Service Announcements on Adolescents Evaluation of Ad Effectiveness,"A Tale of Three Vices: Communication About Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol to Adolescents","This study explored the possible negative impact of a specific ad feature presence of marijuana sceneson adolescents perception of ad effectiveness. A secondary data analysis was conducted on adolescents evaluations of 60 antimarijuana and general antidrug PSAs that were a part of national and state antidrug campaigns directed at adolescents. The major finding of the study was that marijuana scenes, especially scenes showing actual marijuana smoking behaviors, in antimarijuana PSAs, negatively affected adolescents evaluation of ad effectiveness. This negative impact was mainly present for adolescents at higher levels of risk for marijuana use, and it was not reversed in the presence of strong arguments. The results of this analysis may be used to partially explain the lack of effectiveness of the antidrug media campaign. It may also help us design more effective antimarijuana PSAs by isolating aversive elements in the ads that may elicit boomerang effects in the target population. Limitations and future directions were also discussed."
2007-1461,The Effect of Perceived Source Credibility on Persuasion: Moderators and Mechanism,Examining Media Credibility,,,,Paper,The Effect of Perceived Source Credibility on Persuasion: Moderators and Mechanism,Examining Media Credibility,"This study investigates how individual need to evaluate and timing of source identification (before or after message exposure) influence the strength of the effect of perceived source credibility on persuasion. It also explores the psychological processes underlying the credibility-persuasion relationship. Results of a laboratory experiment (N = 363) indicate that perceived source credibility has a positive effect on persuasion, which tends to be stronger when the source is revealed before (versus after) message exposure. Effect strength change, however, only occurs for individuals who are low in need to evaluate; for those high in need to evaluate, the strength of the positive effect is unaffected by timing of source identification. It is further demonstrated that perceived source credibility has both a direct and indirect effect on persuasion, which is mediated by perceived message validity. The relative strength of the direct and indirect effect varies as a function of individual need to evaluate and timing of source identification."

But are they effective? Previous research has shown that participants in online communities develop a strong sense of social presence with other members. This study takes that research to the comparatively noninteractive realm of a single news article. A 2 (language) X 2 (photograph) by 4 (news article) experiment tested whether reporters could encourage feelings of social presence in readers of online news simply by including a photograph of themselves and using a few examples of social language. Participants reported higher levels of social presence in the condition with social language, but the use of a photograph did not have any effect."

Simple effects analyses showed that those in the maximum blood and medium blood conditions had a significant increase in hostility and physiological arousal, while those in the low blood and no blood conditions did not have such an increase in arousal and hostility. Further analyses indicated that those in the maximum and medium blood conditions used the characters weapon significantly more often than those in the low and blood absent conditions. Implications and future research are discussed."

We hypothesized 3 main effects. Students (N = 130) were recruited from undergraduate Communication classes. The 12 messages were carefully controlled in terms of structure, length, readability, content, and vividness. Our results find, first, that the topic with less involvement was more persuasive and generated a more positive attitude than the topic with higher involvement. Second, statistical evidence was more persuasive and generated a more positive attitude than did narrative evidence. Third, a larger amount of evidence was less persuasive than a smaller amount of evidence. In addition, an interaction effect revealed that a larger amount of narrative evidence was less persuasive than a smaller amount of narrative evidence, but a larger amount of statistical evidence was more persuasive than a smaller amount of statistical evidence. Implications and future directions of these findings were discussed."
2007-1465,The Effect of Video Game Realism on Aggression,Causes and Consequences of Video Game Play,,,,Paper,The Effect of Video Game Realism on Aggression,Causes and Consequences of Video Game Play,"This study tested the effect of videogame realism (comparing Doom 3 to Doom 1) on perceptions of game qualities such as graphicness, pacing, enjoyment and perceptions of violence. Furthermore, utilizing social cognitive observational learning theory, we tested the effect of game realism on three character identification factors and on aggression. Lastly, we tested the moderating effect of identification with the game character on aggression. Overall, we found that players perceived Doom 3 to be more graphic, realistic and difficult than Doom 1 but there were no significant differences for perceived enjoyment, ease, pacing and violence. Regarding identification, there was an effect of the experimental manipulation on two of the three factors with those who played Doom 3 experiencing more involvement and rumination than those who played Doom 1. Lastly, there was both a main effect for Doom 3 and an interaction with involvement on aggression. Compared to Doom 1 and to the control group, those who played Doom 3 and experienced greater involvement were more verbally and physically aggressive and they also reported greater emotional hostility."

Two product types were manipulated in the study. A total of 44 Chinese students were recruited and exposed to 4 types of advertisements. The results suggested that spokesperson-audience congruence worked for low-involvement product (liquid hand soap) only, while spokesperson-brand congruence worked for high-involvement product (laptop computer) only. A significant interaction effect was found by combination of 2 types of congruence for low-involvement product (liquid hand soap), but not for high-involvement product (laptop computer)."

In a 2x2 between subjects design each behavior was varied in two levels: occurrence of the behavior compared to the absence of the behavior. The behavior of the participants was analyzed to determine whether the user mimics the agent´s behavior. Results show that self-touching gestures compared to no self-touching gestures have positive effects on the experiences and evaluations of the user, whereas eyebrow raising evoked less positive experiences and evaluations in contrast to no eyebrow raising. The nonverbal behavior of the participants was not affected by the agents nonverbal behavior. Implications for agent design and basic research on nonverbal communication are discussed."
2007-1468,The Effects of Arguing Expectations and Predispositions on Perceptions of Argument Quality and Playfulness,"Well-Being, Anger, and Arguments",,,,Paper,The Effects of Arguing Expectations and Predispositions on Perceptions of Argument Quality and Playfulness,"Well-Being, Anger, and Arguments","Argument production is, or is expected to be, influenced by a number of factors. Among these are one's expectations about what goes on during interpersonal arguments, one's emotional predispositions about arguing, and the goals of making good and appropriate arguments. This investigation concerns these factors. Argument frames refer to one's expectations about arguing, and personalization of conflict is taken as a reasonable index of feelings about arguing. These self-report batteries are compared to respondents' judgments about the quality, playfulness, and appropriateness of conversational argument moves, presented as vignettes. Half the vignettes presented arguments on public issues, and half on personal topics. Half the versions concluded with a rude argumentative move, and half with a polite one. Respondents rated the concluding moves. Appropriateness, effectiveness, and soundness are so highly intercorrelated that respondents appear to be using the scales synonymously, and so these measures were combined into one, labeled quality. Argument playfulness is distinct, however. The politeness of concluding moves affects their perceived argumentative quality, but has inconsistent effects regarding the arguments' apparent playfulness. Perceived argument quality is poorly predicted by any of the expectations or predispositions except conflict valence. Perception of argument playfulness, in contrast, is predictable by several individual differences measures, including expected argument utility, use of arguing to display dominance, the expectation that arguments can be playful, competitiveness, expectation of civility, and conflict valence."

The findings of this study demonstrated that advice was more effective (resulting in higher perceptions of advice quality and facilitation of coping, as well as stronger intention to implement the advice) when advice givers outlined the efficacy of the advised action, explained the feasibility of undertaking the advised action, addressed the potential limitations of the advised action, and employed politeness strategies when giving advice. The study further found that perceptual counterparts of the manipulated message features and perceived credibility of the advice giver largely mediated the effects of the message variations on the dependent variables."

Using a series of multidimensional factor analyses, we identified 3 factors: failure of self-control, escapism, positive evaluation of online experiences. The other is to investigate how these factors are influenced by the basic psychological needs articulated by the self-determination theory. Using structural equation modeling, we examined how autonomy, competence, and relatedness influenced overall life satisfaction, which, in turn, affected the three factors of online game addiction. The data, collected from 8th graders, adequately fit the hypothesized model. Through latent mean analysis, gender differences were also examined. The male students appeared to have higher levels of failure of addictive behaviors than the female students, and the females appeared to have higher levels of relatedness. The paths coefficients among the constructs, however, did not show statistically significant differences. The implication of the results is that enhancing autonomy, competence, and relatedness would be an effective approach for the female as well as the male adolescents for reducing online game addictive behaviors."

However, the question of how peoples increasing Internet use for health information affects their contact with health professionals has not yet been fully answered. Directly addressing this issue, I examined whether peoples Internet use for health information exerts any effects on their frequency of contact with health professionals, using a 2-wave panel dataset with a national representative sample. Overall, the results showed that Internet use for health information positively predicts health professional contact. The implications of the findings for future research in this area were discussed."
2007-1472,The Effects of Moral Mediation on Childrens Responses to Violent Television,"Parents, Children, Television: The Role of Parental Mediation",,,,Paper,The Effects of Moral Mediation on Childrens Responses to Violent Television,"Parents, Children, Television: The Role of Parental Mediation","The purpose of this study was to discuss the importance of moral mediation through reviewing of literature that documents violent TVs negative effects on childrens negative attitudinal orientations and moral development, identifying moral justification process and mental model activation process that lead to these effects, and lastly, designing and testing moral mediation strategies that modify these processes. Conceptualization of moral mediation within a greater framework of active mediation was also reviewed. The results in this study highlighted the need to mediate violent content through moral mediation that addresses both judgment and reasoning. Parents are encouraged to engage in moral mediation that explains the reasoning behind evaluations for more effective results."
2007-1473,The Effects of Parental Monitoring and Parent-Child Communication About Sex on Adolescents' Sexual Behavior,"A Tale of Three Vices: Communication About Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol to Adolescents",,,,Paper,The Effects of Parental Monitoring and Parent-Child Communication About Sex on Adolescents' Sexual Behavior,"A Tale of Three Vices: Communication About Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol to Adolescents","Using data from a longitudinal survey of adolescents, the present study examined the effects of parental monitoring and parent-child communication about sex on adolescents subsequent initiation of sexual intercourse. Controlling for baseline sexual behavior, adolescents reports of monitoring and communication at round 1 were used to predict sexual intercourse at round 2. Bivariate results indicated that parental monitoring significantly decreased the odds of sexual initiation; however, once relevant covariates were added to the model, including sensation-seeking and relationship status, the effect of monitoring was no longer statistically significant. Parent-child communication about sex was positively associated with sexual initiation, and this result persisted after controls were added to the model. A 1-point increase in the communication scale was associated with a 38% increase in the odds of sexual initiation."
2007-1474,The Effects of Reappraisal and Distraction on Cortisol Levels Among Students in Public Speaking Classes,"Public Speaking, Imagined Interaction, Monitoring Performance, Embarrassment, and Self Deprecation",,,,Paper,The Effects of Reappraisal and Distraction on Cortisol Levels Among Students in Public Speaking Classes,"Public Speaking, Imagined Interaction, Monitoring Performance, Embarrassment, and Self Deprecation","The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of interpersonal communication as a source of comforting on the physiological stress associated with giving a speech in a public speaking class. Cortisol, a stress hormone, was used as an objective measure of stress reactivity, and the effects of distracting or reappraisal comforting messages were examined. Salivary cortisol was collected from 42 students enrolled in an introductory public speaking course, in five intervals prior to an in-class speech and once after the speech. Although the first five cortisol collections did not yield significant results, the final cortisol collection showed that participants in the distraction condition experienced significantly less stress than participants in the control condition. Because these results provide insight into the trajectory of stress decay, they lay the foundation for future research on the impact of comforting communication on physiological stress."
2007-1475,The Effects of Seeking and Scanning on Behavioral Intention: Theory of Planned Behavior Approach to Seeking and Scanning,Cancer Information Seeking,,,,Paper,The Effects of Seeking and Scanning on Behavioral Intention: Theory of Planned Behavior Approach to Seeking and Scanning,Cancer Information Seeking,"This study examines a possible theoretical mechanism through which health information seeking as well as health information exposure through routine use of media (called scanning) may affect cancer-related prevention and screening behaviors. Data came from a survey conducted among a list-assisted, national random digit dial-recruited panel of adults, ages 40-70 (N = 1,753). Outcomes were intentions to perform cancer prevention (exercise, diet, fruit and vegetable consumption) and screening behaviors (PSA test, colonoscopy, mammogram) The proposed theoretical mechanisms for the relationship between the seeking and scanning measures and the outcomes is the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Our results showed that seeking and scanning behaviors were associated with intention to perform each preventative or screening behavior. Furthermore, these relationships were substantially (in the case of seeking) and almost completely (in the case of scanning) mediated by attitude, social norm, and perceived behavioral control. The implications of the findings for future research in this area were discussed."
2007-1476,The Effects of Strategic News on Political Cynicism and Vote Choice Among Young Voters,"lective Exposure, News, and Politics",,,,Paper,The Effects of Strategic News on Political Cynicism and Vote Choice Among Young Voters,"Selective Exposure, News, and Politics","This study investigates the relationship between strategic news exposure and political cynicism and vote choice among young voters in the context of a referendum on an issue of European integration. Using a survey (n=720) and a media content analysis, we link media use measures to indicators of media content so as to provide a compelling link between exposure to media content and cynicism. As hypothesized, we find a positive relationship between exposure to strategically framed campaign coverage and political cynicism. In addition, we find that cynicism is related to voting no, which suggests that cynicism served as a mediator in the relationship between media exposure and a no vote. The results are discussed in the light of extant research on media, political cynicism, and electoral behavior in the case of direct democracy."
2007-1477,The Effects of Structural Features and Information Introduced on Internet Advertising,formation Systems Interactive High-Density: Processing Persuasive Messages,,,,Extended Abstract,The Effects of Structural Features and Information Introduced on Internet Advertising,Information Systems Interactive High-Density: Processing Persuasive Messages,"The proposed study on Internet advertising is based on the line of research on the impact of information density associated with the onset of the structural features in television messages. A long line of research shows that structural features in mediated messages (i.e., camera changes in television messages) elicit orienting responses (Thorson & Lang, 1992; Lang, Geiger, Strickwerda & Sumner, 1993). In an attempt to improve the rough categorization of the information introduced by a structural feature (i.e., cut & edit), Lang and her colleagues proposed the concept of Information Introduced, or I-squared (Lang, Bradley, Park, Shin, & Chung, 2004). In order to avoid confusion with Audio I-Squared proposed by Potter et al. (2005), the I-squared developed by Lang et al. (2004) is now called Video I-squared. The total number of structural feature in a television message affects the cognitive resources allocated for message processing, while the sum of Video I-Squared is related to the amount of cognitive resources required for processing the message. Since its introduction, Video I-squared has been used exclusively on television messages. The proposed study attempts to apply Video I-squared to internet advertising which has structural features that resembles camera changes of television messages. A total of 95 college students from a large Southeast Asian University participated in the study for extra credit toward their class grade. Data analysis is ongoing."
2007-1478,The Effects of Students Intrinsic Motivation on Academic Achievement and Preference for Cooperative Learning,proving Educational Outcomes,,,,Paper,The Effects of Students Intrinsic Motivation on Academic Achievement and Preference for Cooperative Learning,Improving Educational Outcomes,"The main purpose of the present study is to explorer the effects of students intrinsic motivation on academic achievement and cooperative over competitive learning preferences using the framework of self-determination theory. We hypothesized that students perceived pressures in classroom would influence the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness underpinning self-determination theory. In turn these basic needs would influence students academic achievement (Model 1), and cooperative vs. competitive learning preferences (Model 2) via intrinsic motivation. Using a nationally represented sample of 6,908 middle school students (Korean Longitudinal Study 2005), we tested the hypothesized causal links among the variables with Structural Equation Modeling. The result showed that environmental pressure influenced students' autonomy and competence. Perceived competence had and direct impact on achievement. The basic psychological need for relatedness was highly associated with preference in cooperative learning, and competence was highly associated with competitive learning. With these results, we can identify the students psychological conditions for academic achievement and effective cooperative learning."
2007-1479,"The Effects of Video Game Violence and Frustration on Aggressive Tendencies: A Test of the Mediating Influences of Affect, Cognition, and Arousal",A Closer Look at Violent Video Games: Beyond the Simple Effects Paradigm,,,,Paper,"The Effects of Video Game Violence and Frustration on Aggressive Tendencies: A Test of the Mediating Influences of Affect, Cognition, and Arousal",A Closer Look at Violent Video Games: Beyond the Simple Effects Paradigm,"Several studies have shown that violent video game play can lead to various aggressive effects, such as increases in aggressive affect, aggressive cognition, arousal, and aggressive behavior. While many of these studies explore the content of video game play (violent vs. nonviolent), they often ignore the importance of contextual elements such as game play-induced frustration. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives, the present study argues that playing any video game, violent or not, can cause aggression if the game play experience is sufficiently frustrating. Results of this experiment (n = 124) support this notion and also demonstrate that several variables mediate the relationship between violent video game play and aggression."
2007-1480,The Effects of Visual Literacy and the Perception of Digital Alteration in Photojournalism,Taking Visual Representation in the News Seriously,,,,Paper,The Effects of Visual Literacy and the Perception of Digital Alteration in Photojournalism,Taking Visual Representation in the News Seriously,"This study aimed to find the effect of the readers perception of digital alteration of news photographs and visual literacy on the evaluation of the news article. Results from an experimental study indicated that the subjects who perceived the digital alteration process of the news photograph evaluated the news article more negatively. Also, by suggesting 2 aspects of visual literacy, the visual editing literacy and visual production literacy, this study tried to find the interaction effect of the perception of digital alteration and the visual literacy. There was a significant interaction effect of the perception of the digital alteration process and the visual editing literacy of the readers, but no effect for visual production literacy. The result suggested that the readers more capable at editing visual message were more critical in evaluating the news article when they perceived the digital alteration process. This study suggests that education on visual literacy, especially visual editing ability, can empower readers to become more critical and defensive in evaluating the media."
2007-1481,The Endurance of Gatekeeping in an Evolving Newsroom: A Multimethod Study of Web-Generated User Content,Constructing News in the New Media Age,,,,Paper,The Endurance of Gatekeeping in an Evolving Newsroom: A Multimethod Study of Web-Generated User Content,Constructing News in the New Media Age,"Today, online media allow the public to join professional journalists in the newsgathering, reporting, and dissemination process, thereby facilitating what some refer to as a reversal of the gatekeeping process through a convergence of content producers. This study employed a multimethod approach to identify and access the processes used to generate Web-generated user content and its influence on gatekeepers decision-making regarding the print edition of one community newspaper identified as a prototype of the citizen journalism movement. The study also analyzed three newspapers to determine how much and what kinds of user content made its way from the Web into print. It was determined the impact of Web-generated user content transcends the physical amount of user content in print; its importance rests in the cooperation and conversation the newspapers Web site facilitates between the newsroom and the public."
2007-1482,The Ethical Counselor Role: Strategic Decision Making in Communication Management,Public Relations Top Papers Session,,,,Paper,The Ethical Counselor Role: Strategic Decision Making in Communication Management,Public Relations Top Papers Session,"Communication managers are sometimes referred to as the corporate conscience of an organization. But, how common is the enacting of an ethical counsel role among public relations or communication professionals? Do they advise their dominant coalition on ethics, and feel trained and ready to do so? To examine these questions, mixed methods were employed to study public relations professionals. Quantitative research found that 65% of public relations professionals do advise their dominant coalition, and most believe very strongly that communicators should act as ethics counsel to senior management. This research revealed that ethics counseling situations and crises offer valuable opportunities for participation in strategic management and eventual dominant coalition inclusion for senior public relations professionals to act as ethical advisors."
2007-1483,"The Evaluation of Popular Music in Comparative Perspective: American, German, and Dutch Popular Music Reviews",Popular Music and the Nation,,,,Paper,"The Evaluation of Popular Music in Comparative Perspective: American, German, and Dutch Popular Music Reviews",Popular Music and the Nation,"Over the past 50 years, popular music has received increasing editorial space in American and European newspapers and has apparently gained in status and artistic legitimacy, though the degree of change varies across countries (Janssen et al., 2005). Some have argued that popular music criticism has assimilated the evaluative criteria traditionally associated with high art aesthetics, while others have claimed that popular music discourse opposes the evaluative principles of high art worlds in favor of a popular aesthetic. Just as increases in editorial space for popular music vary across countries, we expect that the presence of high art and popular aesthetic criteria in popular music reviews also varies cross-nationally. In this paper, we compare the prevalence of various high art and popular evaluative criteria in popular music album reviews in American, Dutch, and German newspapers. In the US, the boundary between high art and popular aesthetics appears to be weakest, with most popular music reviews drawing on both types of criteria. We find that German reviewers generally take the most high art approach to popular music reviews and use the least popular aesthetic criteria, while Dutch reviews clearly favor the popular aesthetic over high art criteria."
2007-1484,The Excess of Meaning and the Value of Influence,Reality a Scarce or Abundant Resource?,,,,Paper,The Excess of Meaning and the Value of Influence,Is Reality a Scarce or Abundant Resource?,"When he said that humans live with an excess of meaning in a world without enough, Lévi-Strauss was describing the human condition. It is only to the extent he was correct that we could imagine reality, meaning, or history to be in short supply. The scarcity arguments forwarded by Carey or Appadurai are not claims about the human condition but about the means of social influence. That issue, who has influence over others thoughts about reality, meaning, or history, can only be interesting if there are choices to be made, if in fact, there might be something we could call an excess of meaning. From the excess of meaning derives the ubiquity of magical thinking, also a fact of the human condition. I will illustrate the value of Lévi-Strausss thinking on these issues with examples drawn from public responses to 9/11, posthumous reputations of musicians, and contemporary celebrities."

This study represents the first application of the third person effect hypothesis to the analysis of the perceived and the actual effects of antidrug ads. Regardless of whether or not they have used drugs, adolescents perceived that they are more influenced by antidrug ads than their friends or peers who currently use drugs, indicating the first-person effect. Those who have used drugs perceived that they are less influenced by the ads than their peers who currently do not use drugs, indicating the third-person effect. The perceived effect of the ads estimated by adolescents who have used drugs was smaller than the perceived effect expected by those who have not used drugs. Perceived informativeness and realism influenced perceived message quality, which was associated strongly with the perceived effect on self and other but weakly with the first-person effect. The perceived effect on self showed a substantial positive association with the actual effects of antidrug attitudes and intentions."
2007-1486,The First Mediated War  Israel and the Hezbollah in Lebanon Summer 2006,Media Wars: Lessons From Lebanon,,,,Paper,The First Mediated War  Israel and the Hezbollah in Lebanon Summer 2006,Media Wars: Lessons From Lebanon,"TV first brought war visuals into the American living rooms during the war in Vietnam in the 1960s. 20 years later, with satellites and on-line broadcasting, civilians in Rome, Paris and New York could watch the military campaign as it simultaneously took place in the Persian Gulf; the concept CNN effect was born. The medias influence on foreign affairs has grown during the wars in Kosovo, Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq. Yet the 2006 clash in Lebanon between Israel and the Hezbollah represents a quantitative leap.

Thus the term used by students of political communication  mediated politics  should be adopted to the field of media and the military. This was the first mediated war. The major reason for this phenomenon is the fact that these asymmetrical wars or low intensity conflicts are wars of conscience. Unlike past conventional wars, their purpose is to shape public opinion. Therefore the visuals seen on the TV screen in the rear are not less significant than actual events that take place in the war theatre.

The paper also describes other manifestations of the mediated war, e.g., the impact of technological innovations, media modes of production, dissemination and media logic, the use of the internet, cellular phones, the cyber space and the blogosphere."
2007-1487,The Fluidity of Religious Forms and their Attractiveness for Audiovisual Communicative Media,"Media as Contested Spaces of Religious/Spiritual Evolution: Rituals, Spectacles, Commodities, and Markets",,,,Paper,The Fluidity of Religious Forms and their Attractiveness for Audiovisual Communicative Media,"Media as Contested Spaces of Religious/Spiritual Evolution: Rituals, Spectacles, Commodities, and Markets","In the current period of late modernity, a new stage has been reached in the long history of dynamic interactions between religion and developing media. This has led to almost contradictory diagnoses:

On the one hand, sociologists highlight the increasing functional differentiation of late modern societies, which eventually led to the emergence of the most recent social subsystem: mass media. On the other hand, cultural theorists and media scholars observe a trend that seems to counter functional differentiation: not only the transformative adaptation of a wide range of religious forms (especially by television) but also religions calculated incorporation of media.
This paper seeks to explore examples of such blending of religion and media. In addition, it will discuss and map theoretical accounts developed to date. Finally, it will expand upon the notion of a transition and transformation of cultural forms."

Blog design, which has evolved very differently from online news design, is rarely discussed. In this article, I examine the roots of the blog form, in an attempt to place this emerging design genre in its historical and cultural context."
2007-1489,The Four Frames of Citizenship: Citizenship Appeals in Promotional Films for the Beijing Olympics,Chinas Olympic Makeover: Shaping Chinas Global Image via the 2008 Beijing Olympics,,,,Paper,The Four Frames of Citizenship: Citizenship Appeals in Promotional Films for the Beijing Olympics,Chinas Olympic Makeover: Shaping Chinas Global Image via the 2008 Beijing Olympics,"This paper analyzes how five short promotional films produced by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad construct four levels of citizenship: the local, the national, the regional, and the global. I focus on how the films negotiate tensions between promoting Chinese nationalistic pride while simultaneously appealing to the Olympic Movements notions of global citizenship. This is complicated by the Organizing Committee having to meet the expectations of diverse audiences that are also stakeholders in the 2008 Games, such as the International Olympic Committee, corporate sponsors, and foreign and domestic media. The promotional film for the 2008 slogan, One World, One Dream, for example, combines visual cues that link Chinese history and accomplishments with emblematic images of diverse cultures in Asia and worldwide. Other films, such as China Forever, combine images of Beijing with Chinas rich history and diverse citizenry in order to emphasize nationalistic ardor."

Universities are faced with the important task of following the ongoing changes in the media market in order to make informed decisions for a contemporary journalism education. But what are the requirements, and are they similar in countries with a different educational background? In a comparative study of journalism education in the United States and Germany, both media professionals and journalism educators were asked for their opinion on what contemporary and future journalism education should look like. The survey included questions regarding
 the future development of the media sector and the impact of technological trends on everyday journalistic work,
 how journalism education should react to these trends,
 and what professional requirements are expected of young journalists entering the profession these days.
For the study, all accredited journalism programs and a representative number of chief editors and news directors in both countries where asked for their opinion via an online survey. Drawing from these empirical findings, the study will point out expectations about the development of journalism education programs in both countries as well as differences and similarities between US and German media and educational trends in journalism."

Innovative although somewhat complex mechanisms were developed to implement this mandate. This paper identifies some of the key features of the E-rate program and how they have been implemented, issues to be addressed, and recommendations for the future of the program."
2007-1492,The Future of TV Commercials,Current Issues in Advertising Research,,,,Paper,The Future of TV Commercials,Current Issues in Advertising Research,Advertising as an important part of broadcast content has been neglected by mass communication research. Changes in the TV industry concerning the production and distribution of content but also changed usage patterns create the necessity to reevaluate how commercials are produced and inserted into the program. As traditional commercial breaks face growing avoidance strategies we analyze how industry professionals value the efficiency and effectiveness of TV commercials. Additionally we examine whether the professionals increasingly make use of hybrid advertising formats integrating the commercial message into the editorial content. To address these questions we conducted expert interviews with senior executives in the advertising and media industry. We find that TV commercials are still considered the most important advertising format and cannot be substituted. Nevertheless the future is seen in integrated intra- and intermedial campaigns using both traditional but increasingly also hybrid advertising formats. Ultimately hybrid formats might transform traditional advertising into quasi-editorial content eliminating the boundaries between editorial content and commercial message.
2007-1493,The Gay Marriage Debate: Did the Media Agenda Drive the Policy Agenda or Vice Versa?,Agenda Setting,,,,Paper,The Gay Marriage Debate: Did the Media Agenda Drive the Policy Agenda or Vice Versa?,Issues in Agenda Setting,"Justice Antonin Scalia insisted in a strongly worded dissent to the U.S. Supreme Courts Lawrence v. Texas decision in 2003 that the ruling to decriminalize homosexuality would open the way for gay marriage. Within months, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ordered its Legislature to permit same-sex unions. A continent away, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered his city to begin performing gay marriages. This case study examines nearly 13 months of Associated Press coverage of the nationwide gay-marriage debate, culminating with the U.S. Senates defeat in 2004 of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex unions. Using critical analysis, it explores how the media agenda influenced the policy agenda and vice versa. It finds that media-driven policy stories overwhelmed those driven by the policy agenda, since reporters have many more choices than do policymakers for keeping an issue alive. Further, the U.S. presidential election campaigns of 2004 magnified the ways in which reporters could press for putting gay marriage on the policy agenda. While the policy agenda on gay marriage certainly influenced the media agenda, the media agenda likely also propelled the policy agenda on both coasts, and in a dozen states in between, faster and further than it would have gone otherwise. This likely resulted because, in accord with the theorizing of Walgrave and Van Aelst (March 2006), gay marriage was an unobtrusive and new issue, political actors had clear responsibility over it, and the reporting was dramatic, unambiguous and pointed toward self-evident solutions."
2007-1494,The Genre-Specific Effects of Informative and Entertainment Media on Personal and Social Risk Perceptions,"Message and Social Features Affecting Information Seeking, Risk Perceptions, and Personal Disclosures About Health",,,,Paper,The Genre-Specific Effects of Informative and Entertainment Media on Personal and Social Risk Perceptions,"Message and Social Features Affecting Information Seeking, Risk Perceptions, and Personal Disclosures About Health","One of the central elements of effective health communication efforts is to communicate accurate level of risk to the public. The impersonal-impact hypothesis (Tyler & Cook, 1984), however, predicts that mass media only have an impact on social risk perceptions, but not personal risk. The underlying assumption of this hypothesis - that the mass media are a monolithic whole  needs to be challenged. The present study sought to advance theory and research on the differential-impact hypothesis on 2 major fronts. First, the changes in media landscape compel the media content to be further decomposed into news media, documentaries, traditional entertainment shows, and new form of entertainment education shows. To this end, a conceptual framework for understanding genre-specific media effects on risk perceptions is proposed. Second, this study decomposed the audience in terms of their risk status- smokers and nonsmokers- and examined if the effects of different media genres are different between these 2 segments of the public. A survey of 558 college students was conducted in South Korea, in which the rate of smoking is estimated to be one of the highest in the world and various public health initiatives are currently being taken to reduce the rate. The results show that smokers and nonsmokers exhibited different patterns of risk perception upon the exposure to different media genres. This suggests that the predictions of the impersonal-impact hypothesis may no longer be relevant to the present media landscape, and that not only media genres but also audience types need to be disentangled in assessing media effects on risk perceptions. Lastly, implications on future risk communication research are discussed."
2007-1495,The Global Knowledge Order: Defining the International Knowledge Race,Competition or Regulation? Telecommunications and Global Knowledge Issues,,,,Paper,The Global Knowledge Order: Defining the International Knowledge Race,Competition or Regulation? Telecommunications and Global Knowledge Issues,"The problem of knowledge development in comparative context poses a foundational challenge for maintaining competitive leadership in innovation and ideas and signifies the evolution of what this paper calls a new international knowledge order in the 21st century. Drawn from a multi-year investigation of world knowledge systems, the paper assesses three key dimensions of the global knowledge race. First, it addresses gaps in current literature as well as departures taken in this study from current social science frameworks. Research to date has yet to formulate alternative frameworks for understanding the problem of idea innovation, nor succeeded in transcending geographic boundaries to pursue complex social causes of comparative knowledge advantage. Second, the paper evaluates strengths and weaknesses of regional approaches to knowledge development in four world regions which reveal that the form in which information technologies and knowledge systems evolve are not intrinsically determined by technology or tradition but are politically and culturally shaped by prevailing institutions and social forces. Finally, the investigation makes it possible to suggest dynamic knowledge properties as core components of a new theoretical framework for the study of contemporary knowledge growth across different national contexts."

Susanne Langer began to define the meeting place of the discursive and the presentational in the early 20th century, but rhetorical scholars still need to take more steps to clearly define the role of visual rhetoric in the dominatingly visual world of the 21st century. This essay takes a step closer to defining that meeting place by evaluating protest images of the war on terror depicted on posters that focus on functioning to target an external audience and developing a generic approach to the analysis of visual protest rhetoric."
2007-1497,The Half-Life of Outrage,The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,,,,Paper,The Half-Life of Outrage,The Debate Over Corporate Social Responsibility: Past and Future Trends,"Ken Lay is dead, his criminal convictions have been expunged and I dont feel too good myself. It seems incomprehensible that in a handful of years we are hearing the concerted corporate drumbeat to roll back the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. And yet, that is precisely the case. Corporate interests continue to embrace the hazily defined notion of corporate social responsibility. At the same time, they are working publicly to dilute the law created as a symbolic bulwark against corporate excess. Perhaps this case is a paragon example of the dexterity with symbols that observers describe as a key management skill. We are invited to believe that the loss of $38 billion in the ENRON debacle is, like Al Gores explanation of global warming, an inconvenient truth."
2007-1498,The Healthcare Consumer's Dilemma: Patients' Rights in an Era of Managed,Creating the Neoliberal Subject in Health Communication,,,,Paper,The Healthcare Consumer's Dilemma: Patients' Rights in an Era of Managed,Creating the Neoliberal Subject in Health Communication,"Consumer has become a common synonym for patient in US healthcare. The term evokes the idea of patient empowerment yet also revulsion at the association of market language with a social good such as healthcare. 1960s-70s rights groups, especially the womens health movement, adopted consumer as a radical redefinition of the paternalistic doctor-patient relationship and as a critique of the emergent medical industrial complex. These movements considered information key to empowering the patient-as-consumer. Neoliberalist health policies since the 1980s have reduced consumer empowerment to a set of choices dictated principally by insurance corporations and managed care organizations. This paper examines the patient-consumer both historically and in light of todays troubling dilemma wherein the plethora of health information in the media and advice on being an active healthcare consumer has failed to alleviate the institutional constraints, produced by an increasingly bureaucratized and corporatized healthcare system, upon patients rights to quality care."
2007-1499,The Heart of Serious Game Design,The Heart and Science of Designing Serious Games for Education,,,,Paper,The Heart of Serious Game Design,The Heart and Science of Designing Serious Games for Education,"Serious games must balance the sometimes conflicting values of game designers, instruction designers, and content experts. These domains converge at the heart of serious game design. Designing effective, engaging serious games requires theoretical understanding of learning, cognition, emotion, and play. Along with great game design, serious games need content and pedagogy expertise, design research, and impact research. Serious game design is a relatively new discipline. Due to a lack of standard practices, the serious game design process varies dramatic from one team to another. The lack of a common language and process has resulted in a fractured community and an ad hoc approach to design that often results in serious games that do not achieve their full potential. This paper introduces a Design/Play/Experience framework that provides a language to discuss serious game design, a methodology to analyze a design, and a process to design a serious game."
2007-1500,The Hostile Media Effect in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election,Exploring Perceived Media Influence,,,,Paper,The Hostile Media Effect in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election,Exploring Perceived Media Influence,"This study explored the role of political identity, perceived media influence, interpersonal discussion, and the election outcome in hostile media bias during the 2004 U.S. presidential election. Young adult voters (N = 234) completed self-administered questionnaires less than one week prior to the election, and 166 of these respondents completed questionnaires after the election. As expected, both pre- and post-election, Republicans and Democrats perceived news coverage as biased against their candidate, whereas Independents perceived the coverage as fair. Stronger political identification was associated with greater media hostility. Hostile media bias was associated with perceived media effects on outgroup voters, but not with perceived effects on ingroup or average voters. After the election, hostile media bias dropped among Republicans, whose candidate won, but not among Democrats. Finally, Democrats (but not Republicans) who discussed the election results more often with like-minded individuals perceived greater media bias. Interpretations of the findings are discussed."
2007-1501,The Human Face Specificity for Visual Processing of Human and Human-like Animal Cartoons,formation Systems Interactive High-Density: Examining Media Processes and Effects,,,,Paper,The Human Face Specificity for Visual Processing of Human and Human-like Animal Cartoons,Information Systems Interactive High-Density: Examining Media Processes and Effects,"This study investigates how individual differences in age and motivated cognition influence the processing of emotional faces. Few studies have investigated how emotion is processed in faces. And, no study that we are aware of to date in the field of communication has addressed how the emotional facial expressions of media cartoon characters are processed by children. Here we present results from a study that investigated emotional responses in children from the ages of 11-17 while they viewed pictures of the faces of human and animal cartoon characters. Results show that children do respond emotionally to emotional faces and that these responses are faster and more like adult responses for older children. In addition, emotional responses differ as a function of whether the cartoon characters are animals or humans. Responses to human faces are more predictable and faster. Responses to animal faces suggest that children have some difficulty recognizing emotion in animated animal faces ad that this difficulty is reduced with age. In addition, there is evidence that neutral animal faces receive more processing than either positive or negative animal faces."
2007-1502,The Illusion of Objectivity in the Documentary Berkeley in the Sixties,Constructing and Reconstructing the '60s,,,,Paper,The Illusion of Objectivity in the Documentary Berkeley in the Sixties,Constructing and Reconstructing the '60s,"The 1990 documentary Berkeley in the Sixties recounted events from the history of activism at the California State University at Berkeley. This documentary advanced the idea that protest is a legitimate form of civic engagement. Talking head interviews and archival images were objectivity codes that gave credibility to this film as a balanced depiction of the Berkeley student movements, even though the film privileged the perspectives of former activists. An analysis of the film and its journalistic reviews suggests that the documentarys formal structure played a central role, perhaps more than the content of the film, in the construction of the films legitimacy. Alternatively, an analysis indicates the presence of objectivity codes may delimit opportunities for controversial ideas to have legitimacy in popular culture."
2007-1503,The Impact of Exemplars and CRM Displays on Television Viewers Perceptions and Judgements,Judging the Whole by Some of Its Parts: Advances in Exemplification Research,,,,Paper,The Impact of Exemplars and CRM Displays on Television Viewers Perceptions and Judgements,Judging the Whole by Some of Its Parts: Advances in Exemplification Research,"Exemplification theory claims that media coverage of issues contains two basic types of information: Base rate information describes an issue or problem in a summary-type fashion (statistical data, frequency of occurrences, distribution of opinions, etc.). Exemplar information is based on the individual expression of opinions or the de-scription of an individual fate. The body of empirical research shows that exemplars are more powerful in influencing recipients own judgments and perceptions. Rea-sons for the marginal impact of base rate information might be (1) a general difficulty in processing the meaning of figures and (2) the pallid nature of this kind of informa-tion. Therefore, the present study  instead of using numeric information  visualizes base rates through continuous response measurement displays (CRM) showing a fictitious average assessment of others who have watched the video before. In a two-factorial design, we manipulated the tendency of the CRM graphs (positive vs. negative; base rates) and the tendency of individuals reporting positive or negative judgments towards the video (exemplars). Contrary to previous results, the data show that both exemplars and CRM graphs have an almost equal capability to influ-ence viewers judgments and perceptions. Based on these findings, consequences for a broader theory of exemplification effects are outlined."
2007-1504,The Impact of Free Daily Newspapers on the Circulation of Paid Newspapers,The Changing Environment of Media Industries,,,,Paper,The Impact of Free Daily Newspapers on the Circulation of Paid Newspapers,The Changing Environment of Media Industries,"Paid dailies in Western Europe and Northern America have seen their circulation decline in the last decade. During the same period free daily newspapers have seen their circulation go up to more than 30 million. In this paper the relation between the two developments is studied in 14 European markets. Circulation development before and after the introduction of free papers was compared. Also data from countries without free papers were used to assess whether non-free dallies markets also suffered. Media substitution, however, seems to be modest at least. Other factors may be more important causes for the decline in paid newspaper circulation. Long term effects, however, are not yet clear."
2007-1505,The Impact of Global News Coverage on International Aid,Global Media in Local Context,,,,Paper,The Impact of Global News Coverage on International Aid,Global Media in Local Context,"This study examines the impact of global news coverage on international aid in the global system. Specifically, this study investigates how global news coverage influences aid allocation and aid relations. Several common determinantsinternational trade, population, and GDP per capitaof both international news flows and aid were examined. The global bystander intervention model provides a causal mechanism that encourages international aid, emphasizing the importance of communication among members in a social system and the process of decision-making on national policy to assist other countries. International news networks play an important role as agenda-setting agents in this process. A hypothesized path model mainly expects the positive impacts of global news coverage on aid amount and the number of donors. It was tested by using data for 159 recipient countries. The results support the causal relationships. That is, recipient countries with a high level of news coverage receive more aid and have more international relations than those with less coverage. In addition, based on the results of total effects, international trade and population positively affect international aid as well as news coverage. Conversely, GDP per capita negatively influence international aid, and it is not a significant determinant of global news coverage."
2007-1506,The Impact of Political Discussion on Political Awareness: A New Research Design,terpersonal Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Impact of Political Discussion on Political Awareness: A New Research Design,Interpersonal Communication Interactive Paper Session,"This paper proposes a straightforward normative benchmark and a new method to evaluate the contribution of interpersonal political discussions to democratic processes. The key idea is to evaluate the contribution of political discussions to the quality of democracy via their ability to assist participants to emulate what their voting behavior would be if they were fully informed. While this benchmark is not relevant for all the relevant aspects of deliberative processes, it nevertheless captures a key idea that goes back to Lazarsfeld and Berelsons studies of political communications, but remained understudied afterwards. The paper uses panel survey data and simulations to demonstrate the potential of the new simulation method proposed. The results suggest that participation in interpersonal political discussions does indeed increase ones ability to offer an opinion on political matters, but may not lead to any gains in factual knowledge. Moreover, participants ability to vote as I they were fully informed is not affected by their information level. It is suggested that the reason for this may be that the conditions for ideal deliberations are rarely present in the circumstances of everyday political communication. Thus, further research may be directed on identifying the conditions and contexts where interpersonal communication can successfully perform this function for democratic processes."

Spam created a short-term rise in the price of the average stock. It was found that a message strategy consisting of sending a number of messages over a period of days could exert a positive effect on stock price.
2007-1508,The Implications of Exemplification Theory for Newsroom Diversity Policies,Judging the Whole by Some of Its Parts: Advances in Exemplification Research,,,,Paper,The Implications of Exemplification Theory for Newsroom Diversity Policies,Judging the Whole by Some of Its Parts: Advances in Exemplification Research,"News organizations have experimented over the years with diversity policies to in-crease and improve coverage of minority groups. Such policies are designed to in-crease the visibility of underrepresented groups so as to produce news that is more representative of the populations it addresses and with an additional goal of increas-ing readership. Previous exemplification research suggests there may be unintended effects of these policies that require increased use of minorities as expert and non-expert sources in news stories, but the present study, an experiment that manipu-lates use of minority exemplars in news stories, also suggests that such policies can have potentially desired effects and alter attitudes about members of minority groups."

Bertelsmann,Where Does Code End and the State Begin?,,,,Paper,The Inducement Theory in Post-Grokster: Arista Records v. Flea World; UMG v. Bertelsmann,Where Does Code End and the State Begin?,"In Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, the Supreme Court ruled that providers of peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing technology could be held secondarily responsible for the copyright infringement committed by their users if they actively market and induce users to infringe. Through the analysis of the case law in both Arista Records v. Flea World and UMG v. Bertelsmann, this study examines the emerging impact of the inducement theory on third party liability in copyright infringement. Is a flea market analogous to a technological device? Can investors be held liable for the activities of the companies in which they invest? What is the impact of the inducement theory on contributory and vicarious liability? This article analyzes what the inducement theory might mean to the delicate balance between public and private interests which is the bedrock of intellectual property laws in this country."
2007-1510,The Inductive-Deductive Dialectic of Group Differentiation,Communcating Within and Between Groups for Maximum Understanding,,,,Paper,The Inductive-Deductive Dialectic of Group Differentiation,Communcating Within and Between Groups for Maximum Understanding,"Sociality is inherently a dialectical process a give and take (Poole, 1988, p. 148). This paper conceptually illustrates how dialectical tensions lead to in-group homogeneity and intergroup heterogeneity by coupling Structuration Theory (Poole, 1988; Poole & McPhee, 2004; Poole, Seibold, & McPhee, 1986) with Social Identity Theory (Tajfel, 1978) and Self-Categorization Theory (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987. Thus, it is argued that convergence within groups and divergence across groups emerges as negotiations to layers of dialectical tensions that situate individuals in groups, and groups in a larger contextual environment. The formation of a group is explored as the culmination of many layers of dialectical forces, enabling members to reap the benefits of both agency and structure in tandem."
2007-1511,"The Influence of Context, Emotion, and Gender Stereotypes on the Realism of Media Stories",formation Systems: Tell Me a Story...Processing of Narrative in Media Content,,,,Paper,"The Influence of Context, Emotion, and Gender Stereotypes on the Realism of Media Stories",Information Systems: Tell Me a Story...Processing of Narrative in Media Content,"Social judgments about stories can influence perceived realism in complex ways. Earlier studies indicated that unexpected emotions are simply less real than expected emotions. There are several reasons to think the situation is not that simple. While the studies controlled for a number of variables, they may have over simplified emotional expression in stories. In addition, there appear to be different expectations about emotion for men and women and those expectations depend on the context. Using a complex multimessage design, this study examines the impact of emotion (anger, happiness), the response (over reaction/under reaction), the situation (achievement/interpersonal), the characters sex, and the participants sex. The situation, the response, and the specific emotion had large, complex effects on perceived appropriateness and realism, but character sex and notions of sex role had less impact than expected. This study adds to a growing catalog of social judgments shown to influence perceptions of the realism of a story and to our understanding of the complex, multidimensional judgments people make about the realism of social interactions."
2007-1512,The Influence of Early Adolescents Television Viewing on Perceived Reality: The Roles of Parental Mediation and Peer Interaction,"Parents, Children, Television: The Role of Parental Mediation",,,,Paper,The Influence of Early Adolescents Television Viewing on Perceived Reality: The Roles of Parental Mediation and Peer Interaction,"Parents, Children, Television: The Role of Parental Mediation",This study considers multiple features of parental mediation and peer interaction in examining their influences on early adolescents perceived reality about mistrust and the dangerous world. This study also examines early adolescents viewing of violent and action-oriented television on their perceived reality. These relationships were proposed as a testing model. The data were collected from 184 families (184 parents and 184 early adolescents). Model testing shows that peer interaction is a compelling contributor to early adolescents construction of social reality about mistrust and danger. Results demonstrate that early adolescents exposure to violent television is a positive predictor of mistrust whereas peer interaction is an indicator of increased danger when they process television information.
2007-1513,The Influence of Electronic Medical Record Usage on Nonverbal Communication in the Medical Interview,"Technology, Social Capital, and Terrorism Preparedness in Health Care",,,,Paper,The Influence of Electronic Medical Record Usage on Nonverbal Communication in the Medical Interview,"Technology, Social Capital, and Terrorism Preparedness in Health Care","This study examined nonverbal communication in relation to Electronic Medical Record (EMR) use during the medical interview. 6 physicians were videotaped during their consultations with 50 different patients at a single setting Veterans Administration Hospital. 3 different office spatial designs were identified and named open, closed and blocked. The open arrangement put physicians in a position to establish better eye contact and physical orientation than did the alternative closed and blocked office configurations. Physicians who accessed the EMR and took breakpoints (short periods of no computer use and sustained eye contact with patients) used more nonverbal cues than physicians who tended to talk with their patients while continuously working on the computer. Long pauses in conversational turn taking associated with EMR use may have positively influenced doctor-patient communication. High EMR use interviews were associated with patients asking more questions than they did in low EMR use interviews. Implications for medical education and future research are discussed."

A survey of 340 college students found that even youth who have grown up with Title IX still rate most sports as masculine. The study also examined the relationship between media use, sports participation, and gender role socialization with sex-typing of sports, finding that socialization factors seemed most linked to perceptions of sex-appropriate sports. Heavy television and TV sports viewing, attitudes toward women, and attitudes toward masculinity were related to sex-typing of masculine sports, but these attitudes were not linked to typing of feminine sports, perhaps demonstrating the ubiquity of the hegemonic notion that sports are, for the most part, inherently male. Current media consumption played a smaller role, and sports participation played no role."

Within actual encounters, verbal fluency is a characteristic that contributes to the speakers credibility. The planning that takes place through imagined dialogues can help a speaker overcome disfluency found in speech. Results from this study indicate plannings influence in the reduction of silent pauses but not vocalized pauses."

This investigation used three issues: the death penalty, radon gas, and human cloning. The data generally supported the presence of the hostile media effect, projection, and persuasive press inference. The projection effect received most support: the effect was present in all three issues. The data suggested the presence of persuasive press inference in 2 issues: radon gas and human cloning. Similarly, the hostile media effect was noticeable in 2 of the 3 issues, radon gas and the human cloning."
2007-1517,"The Influence of Patients' and Health Professionals' Communication on Quality of Care, Health Outcomes, and Treatment Compliance",Developing and Extending Models of Intergroup Communication (Top Papers),,,,Paper,"The Influence of Patients' and Health Professionals' Communication on Quality of Care, Health Outcomes, and Treatment Compliance",Developing and Extending Models of Intergroup Communication (Top Papers),"In this study we investigated communication between patients and health professionals, and specifically focussed on the patient outcomes of quality of care, health, and treatment compliance. Fifty-two patients completed questionnaires before and after their consultation, and 44 responded to the follow-up questionnaire one month later. We investigated communication perceptions through the use of communication accommodation theory (CAT), and outcome measures were adopted from the linguistic model of patient participation (LMOPPC). CAT was used to examine the extent to which patients perceived interactions with their health professionals as accommodative. We also examined the subsequent effect of accommodative communication on patient outcomes. Results indicated that accommodative communication strategies did predict quality of care perceptions, but only emotional expression was a significant predictor on its own. When considered together, quality of care perceptions measured initially and at one-month follow-up did not significantly predict health outcomes, but follow-up measures of quality of care perceptions did uniquely predict health. Finally, emotional expression and commitment significantly predicted treatment compliance, but only emotional expression was a significant individual predictor. This study provides evidence for the important impact of communication during the medical consultation on patient outcomes. It also highlights the importance of health professionals appropriate use of emotional expression. Finally, it provides support for the use of CAT for understanding the impact of communication between patients and health professionals on patient outcomes in the medical consultation context."
2007-1518,The Influence of Situational Constraints on the Commodification of Consultant-Client Interactions,Organizational Communication Interactive Session,,,,Paper,The Influence of Situational Constraints on the Commodification of Consultant-Client Interactions,Organizational Communication Interactive Session,"In consultant-client relationships, the emphasis on economic resources has inherently commodified these interactions into explicit exchanges of time, money, and deliverables. This paper seeks to extend our understanding of consultant-client interactions by examining how situational constraints impact clients valuations of the task and socioemotional resources exchanged when interacting with consultants. A study of professionals responding to scenarios about the resources provided by consultants found the valuation of resources change when situational constraints were present. Regardless of the context, task resources were generally valued more than socioemotional ones. When relational constraints were salient, socioemotional resources were valued more in long-term than short-term relationships. And in the presence of time pressure or budgetary constraints, task needs were valued more than socioemotional needs."
2007-1519,The Influence of Television News Depictions of the Images of War,Top 4 Papers in Mass Communication,,,,Paper,The Influence of Television News Depictions of the Images of War,Top 4 Papers in Mass Communication,"This investigation examined the effects of network television news coverage of combat in Iraq. It featured an experiment designed to assess the influence of television news footage of combat operations and the potential of inoculation treatments as a possible antidote to such influence. The results of the experiment indicated that, compared to a control condition which featured the same news stories but without actual footage of combat, television news reports depicting images of combat exerted significant influence on viewers: reports depicting combat operations increased viewer involvement levels about the war in Iraq and they reduced viewer support for continued U.S. military presence in Iraq. Television news depictions of combat operations also reduced viewer pride in U.S. military presence in Iraq, but they did not affect other emotions. However, regardless of how news stories were packaged, women experienced greater emotional response to network news stories of combat operations than men. The results also shed light on the potential of inoculation to deflect such influence. Both print and print-plus-photograph inoculation manipulations took and were effective in bolstering pride levels against erosion caused by exposure to television news footage of combat. However, inoculation failed to confer resistance to the decline in support for continued U.S. military presence in Iraq resulting from viewers exposure to television news footage of combat operations."
2007-1520,The Influence of the European Commission Data Privacy Protection Directive on Third Countries,The Right to Know and the Right Not to Be Known,,,,Paper,The Influence of the European Commission Data Privacy Protection Directive on Third Countries,The Right to Know and the Right Not to Be Known,"In the current digital age, increasing amounts of personal information are transferred over the Internet. In order to protect the private data of its citizens, the European Union (EU) issued the European Commission Protection Data Privacy Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) in 1995. This law required EU Member States to establish specific safeguards for protecting privacy and required that any non-EU nation that wished to transfer private data with EU businesses provide adequate levels of data protection in their nations laws. This article explores the definition of adequate data privacy protection. The EU has deemed the laws of five nations as adequately protecting data and has consistently followed a set of five criteria in the process of analyzing a third countrys laws. This article concludes with an analysis of the EU's process of determining adequacy and suggests that the EU has shown consistency in its approval process and has thereby become influential in determining the data protection laws of other nations."
2007-1521,The Influence of the Mass Media on Information-Seeking Behavior,"formation-Seeking, Knowledge Gain, and Media Influence",,,,Paper,The Influence of the Mass Media on Information-Seeking Behavior,"Information-Seeking, Knowledge Gain, and Media Influence","This paper investigates how the mass media may influence information-seeking behavior through an analysis of how the release of the movie The Day After Tomorrow, a fictional depiction of global warming causing catastrophic natural disasters, changed the information-seeking behavior of the public on global warming related websites. A ""teachable moment"" of elevated information-seeking activity was found to extend from 10 days before the release date of The Day After Tomorrow to 19 days after the movie release date. A significant positive correlation was found between changes in media coverage of the movie and changes in the information seeking behavior of the public (B = 0.395, b = 0.565, p < 0.001). These results are discussed in light of the dual affective intelligence model developed by Marcus, Neuman, and Mackuen (2000). Additionally, new research directions are proposed to link agenda-setting research with the information-seeking literature."
2007-1522,The Influence of Video News Releases on the Topics Reported in Science Journalism: An Explorative Case Study on the Relationship Between Science Public Relations and Science Journalism,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Influence of Video News Releases on the Topics Reported in Science Journalism: An Explorative Case Study on the Relationship Between Science Public Relations and Science Journalism,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,"A rise in time and cost pressure has led to video news releases (footage) becoming increasingly popular in television editorial offices. Footage represents broadcastable video material which is made available to television stations by companies and institutions for reasons of public relations (PR). Its use is, however, problematical since editorial contents can thus be influenced by third parties. Against the background of the intereffication model of journalism and PR the question of the influence of footage on television reporting is explored on the basis of the example of science journalism. To this end, in a case study 44 German science journalists were asked how they dealt with this material. The results lead to the conclusion that footage is handled pragmatically. In addition, within the framework of a contents analysis of transmission data relating to reporting on the Max Planck Society, the influence of footage material over a period of nine and a half months was determined (n=274). It was revealed here that almost one third of the reporting was directly attributable to PR material whereby contributions induced by footage were represented to a greater extent and were longer than reports based on news releases. The influence on private stations was greater than that on public-service channels. This therefore raises the question about binding rules on how to deal with footage."
2007-1523,The Informationalization of Race: Communication Technologies and the Human Genome in the Information Age - Top ERIC Paper 3rd Place,Racializing Technology: From Cyberspace to the Human Genome Project,,,,Paper,The Informationalization of Race: Communication Technologies and the Human Genome in the Information Age - Top ERIC Paper 3rd Place,Racializing Technology: From Cyberspace to the Human Genome Project,"This paper suggests that a new form of racialization is being produced in the information age through developments and innovations in communication technologies. Increasingly, racial knowledge is being constructed from seemingly neutral and unrelated pieces of information, which are collected, sorted, and analyzed through two key technologies: databases and the Internet. I call this interaction between technology and identity the informationalization of race. As a mode of representation, a structuring device, and as a biological category, race is undergoing a significant transformation in the digital age. I ground this concept in a case study of the next Human Genome Project, the HapMap Project, to understand how technologies are being shaped in a specific institutional setting. Advances in human genomics has recently re-invigorated scientific research into the relationship between race and biology. Where the HGP concluded that humanity is similar at the genetic level, the HapMap Project began by looking for differences between white, African, and Asian groups. The findings from the HapMap project have been promised to help in developing pharmaceuticals that can target common diseases, such as cancer. However, this development also opens the door to old biological conceptions of race and a new phase of the biopolitics of the human body."

2007-1525,The Interaction of Consciousness and Language in Talk,Creating Perspective With Words,,,,Paper,The Interaction of Consciousness and Language in Talk,Creating Perspective With Words,"This essay reviews some of Wallace Chafes (1994) ideas about the implications of the interaction of experience with language for our understanding of consciousness, and an application of Chafes ideas to the problem of transcribing discourse data proposed by Cameron and Stelma (2004). Chafes discourse-based model of consciousness implies that thought occurs primarily in language, perhaps supplemented by images and emotions. Chafe identifies short spurts of speech, which he calls intonation units that, he says, represent bursts of consciousness. Underlying theoretical assumptions about the nature of cognitive processes involved in language use are critiqued in terms of Barsalous (1999) perceptual simulators theory of cognition, according to which thought occurs primarily through simulation of perception, including introspective perception of the thought processes themselves. Language activates perceptual simulators, and forms part but not all of thought. It is proposed that consciousness performs an editing function, in which language is first activated by the perceptual simulators in working memory. Potential utterances in turn activate new perceptual simulators that are compared to the originals and rejected if the match is not sufficiently close (the search for the right words familiar to all speakers and writers). Finally, implications for theory and research on discourse are discussed."
2007-1526,The Interaction of Interturn Silence and Prosody in American and Japanese Perceptions of Trouble in Interaction,Creating Communicative Opportunity Within and Between Many Languages,,,,Paper,The Interaction of Interturn Silence and Prosody in American and Japanese Perceptions of Trouble in Interaction,Creating Communicative Opportunity Within and Between Many Languages,"The current paper addresses the general claim that Japanese speakers are more tolerant of silence. By exploring this possibility experimentally and at the interpersonal level, this project examines whether American English speakers and Japanese speakers actually differ in their perceptions of interturn silence as projecting disagreement. The study also accounts for the role of sequential context (requests vs. assessments) and the prosody of response tokens following silences. The approach replicates the procedures of a published study in which English speakers (n = 123) listened to conversations in which silence was inserted between 1st and 2nd pair parts in request and assessment sequences; prosody of the affirmative responses in those sequences was also manipulated. For the current study, conversations were translated into Japanese by a native speaker and recorded by native speaking Japanese students. Results from Japanese raters (n = 103) indicate that while the Japanese perceive overall greater willingness and agreement than Americans when there is no silence or a short gap (600 ms), when the gap reaches 1200 ms, the purportedly different sensitivity to silence disappears. The prosodic cue (duration of affirmative response) also affects judgments similarly across the 2 language groups.However, sequential environment (request vs. assessment) is more salient for the Japanese."
2007-1527,The Internet and Global Civil Society: Communication & Representation Within Transnational Advocacy Networks,"New Media, Social Development, and Governance",,,,Paper,The Internet and Global Civil Society: Communication & Representation Within Transnational Advocacy Networks,"New Media, Social Development, and Governance","The global Information Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure continues to grow as does the use of this media to negotiate social change and justice. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), grassroots activists, and social movement actors are becoming more intertwined, working within transnational advocacy networks (TANS) to leverage their strengths and make a social impact. Through new and established social networks and the use of the Internet and other technologies, these TANS are contributing to what some consider to be a global civil society operating outside of state and market control. While recognizing the value and importance of these networks and their capacities for social change, it is equally important to understand how these networks facilitate representation among local and global actors. In this paper I examine theories of global civil society and the intersection between TAN actors and their use of the Internet to achieve their objectives. These findings are then compared to broader issues relating to the digital divide, hierarchies of global power, and representation. What is revealed is that large economic, technical, and educational gaps continue to exist between rich and poor that affect network actor involvement. Additionally, little cross-cultural dialogue or communication is being facilitated. I argue that NGOs working within the TANs are in a perfect position to implement and facilitate greater cross-cultural communication and that this act may serve to create more sustainable, long-term social change, rather than traditional reactionary network responses to crisis."
2007-1528,The Internet and the Expansion of Political Discussion in Singapore Elections,Mapping Code Politics: International Perspectives on Web Campaigning,,,,Paper,The Internet and the Expansion of Political Discussion in Singapore Elections,Mapping Code Politics: International Perspectives on Web Campaigning,"This essay will document the changes in the ways in which the use of the
Internet in elections in Singapore has changed since the 2001 election,
examining both the 2005 Presidential Election, and the May, 2006
Parliamentary election. New technologies, including blogs, podcasts,
vodcasts, and instant messaging systems have become much more popular,
and many of these have political relevance and usage. Singapore's
population has begun to use information technologies as an avenue of
expression of opinions on issues of public significance, making the
Internet more politically significant than it was in 2001. It is
appropriate, therefore, to re-examine the way in which the Internet has
become integrated into the political life of Singapore, and
particularly, how the Internet was used during the 2005 Presidential
election and the 2006 General Election. I will also comment on how the
use of the Internet during these elections has introduced subtle changes
into Singapore's political culture, portending a greater potential
impact in later elections."
2007-1529,"The Internet and the Rise of ""Do-It-Yourself Journalism: From September 11 and the Iraq War to Hurricane Katrina","Quality, Credibility, and Morality in Journalistic Genres Online",,,,ractive Paper (Poster),"The Internet and the Rise of ""Do-It-Yourself Journalism: From September 11 and the Iraq War to Hurricane Katrina","Quality, Credibility, and Morality in Journalistic Genres Online","The Internet has become more and more peoples news source. News audiences have been increasingly fracturing, as trust in the mainstream media has declined and the Internet is playing an ever-more-important role. Along with this trend, a new phenomenon called do-it-yourself journalism has surfaced. One of the many reasons the Internet has become more and more popular a news medium is that it fulfills peoples need not being met by the traditional media. The Internet provides a wide variety of sources, up-to-the-last-minute news, and points of view that are different from those in traditional news sources and official government sources. In the past 5 unusual years in American history, from September 11 to the Iraq War to Hurricane Katrina, these sensitive, or sensational, news events have fostered the role of the Internet as not only an alternative, but also a unique source for news information. Meanwhile, do-it-yourself journalism has arisen to prominence. Do-it-yourself journalism is made possible by the no-gatekeeping, interactive nature of the Internet. New technology has made the journalism world different, with this do-it-yourself innovation. While doing good to journalism, however, new technology has also allowed virtually anyone to become a news publisher, some with no editor, affiliation, nor profession standards involved, which has become a problem. This paper explores the background for the rise of do-it-yourself journalism, examines its early evolution process, especially its development from September 11 and the Iraq War to Hurricane Katrina. The study concludes that do-it-yourself journalism has become a significant part of the Internet news culture in the past 4 years, and while playing a positive role in enhancing news information diversity, it may also bring negative effects, if no sensible regulations are established and enforced."
2007-1530,The Internet as a Social Resource for Taiwanese Teenagers: A Study of the Relationship Between Depressive Mood and Internet-Mediated Communication,fluence of Traditional and New Media on Adolescents' Health Behavior,,,,Paper,The Internet as a Social Resource for Taiwanese Teenagers: A Study of the Relationship Between Depressive Mood and Internet-Mediated Communication,Influence of Traditional and New Media on Adolescents' Health Behavior,"This article presents a large-scale preliminary investigation that explored the relationship between Taiwanese teenagers' depressive mood and their Internet-mediated communication. A total of 6,341 teenagers completed a questionnaire that examined this relationship. Chi-square and correlation analysis showed that, depending on their level of depressive mood, respondents used the Internet especially for establishing new relationships, finding people who care for them, and expressing feelings they could not express otherwise. These results shed new light on earlier research that focused exclusively on U.S. Internet users (Kraut et al., 1998, 2002) and suggest that the role which the Internet plays for people with depressive mood depends for an important part on the way this disorder is perceived and dealt with in a particular cultural context."

Application of this theory, which uses psychological factors (beliefs and attitude), social factors (social support and social acceptance), and self efficacy factors (prior experience), enables investigation into why matrimonial sites are being used for partner searches. The study of the attitudes and beliefs, associated with the intention to use the Internet to look for marriage partners, provided a unique window to view the changing trends in mate selection among contemporary Indians and also valuable insights into the subtle shifts in perceptions of the institution of marriage itself. An online survey format was used to recruit Indian citizens based in the US and in India as participants. The study found that there was a significant relationship between attitude and perceived subjective norms and intention to use a matrimonial website. Of the two attitudes towards the use of matrimonial websites was found to be the strongest predictor of intention."
2007-1532,Their Side of the Story: Understanding Health Risk Behaviors From the Participants Perspective,"Assessing Risk, Defining Fear, and Understanding Perceived Control: Implications for Health Communication",,,,Paper,Their Side of the Story: Understanding Health Risk Behaviors From the Participants Perspective,"Assessing Risk, Defining Fear, and Understanding Perceived Control: Implications for Health Communication","How to define risk or risky behaviors has generated a great deal of conceptual confusion (Moore & Gullone, 1996). Some scholars have argued that adolescents and college students might define risk differently than do adults (Alexander et al., 1990; Moore & Gullone, 1996), suggesting that there is a need to define risk behaviors by participants. Responding to such research call, we examined viewpoints of participants for various health risk behaviors. By conducting an online survey, we explored types of risk associated with protective behaviors (e.g., using condoms, getting an HIV test) that have been largely ignored in various health decision-making models. Second, we investigated how the perceived risks associated with both protective and alternative behaviors can influence attitude and behavioral intention. Our data suggest that college students do perceive various risks associated with protective health behaviors, ranging from psychological or financial to emotional risks. We also found a significant impact of the perceived risks associated with protective and alternative behaviors on attitude and behavioral intention. Implication for future research is discussed in a public health campaign context."

Specifically, this research examined the U.S. media coverage of the No Gun Ri incident between September, 1999, when the Associated Press first reported the story of No Gun Ri, and April, 2000, when the Pulitzer board officially legitimized the No Gun Ri account by awarding the prize to the APs investigative team. The analysis of media texts identified 3 narratives: Ill-equipped Troops Unfortunate Mistake, Fear Stricken Soldiers Defensive Action, and Reconciliation, each of which contributed to locating the No Gun Ri text within a larger frame of the American collective memory of the Korean War. No Gun Ri also illustrated both the medias potency as channel and reservoir for countermemories, and their limitations due to the political context and to their own rhetorical conventions."
2007-1534,The Less Said the Better: Framing Through the Absence of Elite Sources,Agenda Setting & Framing,,,,Paper,The Less Said the Better: Framing Through the Absence of Elite Sources,Agenda Setting & Framing,"Framing accomplished through the inclusion of elite sources and the absence of dissenting voices is a well-studied quality of news coverage. Where these studies deal with international issues, most concern issues involving military responses or wars far from U.S. borders. Trade issues, however, affect nearly every aspect of everyday life. Much less is known about the forms framing takes in regard to trade issues. This study of U.S. and Canadian coverage of the discovery of BSE (mad cow disease) in North America constructs the dominant framing in New York Times and Toronto Star coverage and discusses the implications for framing theory. Differences in the framing and the manner in which the frames are supported are described and compared. In particular it is found that framing was accomplished specifically through the absence of U.S. elite voices in U.S. news coverage."
2007-1535,The Liberal-Bias Accusation Against Journalism: Contradictory Evidence from a Visual Perspective,Visual Studies Top Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Liberal-Bias Accusation Against Journalism: Contradictory Evidence from a Visual Perspective,Visual Studies Top Paper Session,"The content analysis reported here scrutinized network news coverage of Republicans, Democrats, and a group of other presidential candidates across four consecutive (1992, 1996, 2000, 2004) election campaigns for bias. Most studies of journalistic bias in TV news focus on the volume of coverage or the verbal component of news, neglecting the visual aspect. This study reveals the importance of incorporating visual analysis into future investigations. Variables related to visual prominence and structural features (editing and camera techniques) used in packaging news stories were employed to do so. Results related to volume of coverage shows that candidates outside the two dominant political parties received relatively little coverage while Republicans and Democrats received more or less equal coverage. Yet, when the visual aspects of coverage are considered it becomes clear that Republicans were the beneficiaries, while the position of other candidates improved markedly. Democrats received the least favorable visual coverage of the three groups, across all four elections."

This paper considers one area of law relevant to speech  defamation  and its relationship with journalism to suggest how such a conceptualization of free speech could be reworked. If to converse involves spontaneous and open feedback that is subject to egalitarian rules of engagement and aimed at consensus formation, then at least some public speech may be better thought of differently: to address a public is particular kind of world-making project; such speech creates divergent and plural publics. Here, these ideas about speech, law, and journalism are explored by drawing on empirical research into defamation litigation and news production practices in Australian, England, and the U.S., and by drawing on Anglo-Australian and U.S. media studies writing and cultural research. This sociolegal, media studies, and cultural research is used to suggest how professional understandings of the value of speech, from within law and journalism, could be reconsidered through recognizing the role of speech in creating diverse publics, which could reconfigure what is seen to be at stake in speech and its control."
2007-1537,The Living Body and the Corpse: Israeli Documentary Cinema and the Intifadah,Trauma and Popular Culture,,,,Paper,The Living Body and the Corpse: Israeli Documentary Cinema and the Intifadah,Trauma and Popular Culture,"This article has two purposes. The first is to describe the way in which Israeli documentaries made during the al-Aqsa Intifadah represent the trauma caused by suicide attacks. Discussing the shift in the politics of the body/corpse as an outcome of the recent conflict, allows us to compare perspectives towards trauma in the Israeli documentary No. 17 is Anonymous (as a representative example of an entire genre), in video recordings of suicide bombers recorded before their missions, and in the Palestinian feature movie Paradise Now. The second purpose of this paper is to propose the negotiation of the body/corpse relation as a new ""materialistic"" discourse for discussing trauma, one that contests the predominance of memory discourse in trauma studies."
2007-1538,The Magazine Market in Denmark and Germany,The Changing Environment of Media Industries,,,,Paper,The Magazine Market in Denmark and Germany,The Changing Environment of Media Industries,"Economic indicators show that publishing sectors in Denmark are between 10 to 15 times smaller than their German counterparts. Other main findings on industry level are Danish industrys underperformance in productivity and a higher relative title diversity both on newspaper and magazine markets compared to Germany. The German publishing industry is mainly characterised by national ownership, representing the strong positions of single companies in the market, while in Denmark foreign media companies dominate the sector and thus influence strategies. Consumer magazine publishing sees significant national differences in strategies pursued. A majority of large and middle-sized German companies relies on differentiation as the main orientation, while 2 major competitors focus on cost leadership. In Denmark, differentiation strategies are observable within a number of magazine subsegments. Within these segments, some publishers rely on differentiation while on enterprise level, only one competitor pursues an explicit strategy of differentiation. In b2b publishing, strategic orientation is less explicit. Some major publishers in both countries show approaches to differentiation, but in general, companies seem to concentrate on content in first place, without pursuing explicit strategies."
2007-1539,The Marketplace in the Classroom: Outcomes of School Commercialism,Health Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Marketplace in the Classroom: Outcomes of School Commercialism,Health Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Past research done on advertising exposure has found that advertising is effective in accomplishing its intended purpose of attracting consumers. However, this research has also demonstrated that there are significant unintended consequences tied to exposure, particularly for children. Increased advertisement exposure has been linked to parent-child conflict, development of materialistic attitudes, obesity, eating disorders and general unhappiness. The purpose of this study was to determine if such effects were found in another realm, commercial exposure at school. A survey of school commercialism was designed and sent to all public school principals in the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts. Using school specific data available from each states Department of Education, results from the administrators surveys were matched to school performance data. Results indicated that nearly all schools sampled (97%) are involved with for-profit businesses. When testing school outcomes, increased commercialism was significantly linked with decreased performance on fitness tests, increased absenteeism, increased discipline problems and decreased performance on academic assessment tests. The results have potentially, important implications for the practice of allowing commercial entities into schools as well as shedding light on the way researchers study the effects of advertising exposure, especially as it relates to Gerbners Cultivation Theory (1969, 2002)."
2007-1540,The Meaning of Organizational Trust,Organizational Communication Interactive Session,,,,Paper,The Meaning of Organizational Trust,Organizational Communication Interactive Session,"Over the past decade, trust has been gaining special attention as a crucial component of organizational life. It is increasingly being viewed as an important ingredient in business, global business, learning organizations, and in the new economy. Research presented here includes the results of 2 studies designed with the purpose to explore the meaning of organizational trust. The first study was conducted in 2004 in a large metropolitan area in the southeastern United States, whereas the second study was conducted in a Midwestern regional center in 2006. The findings show that organizational trust contains a cognitive, moral, and affective component and that there is a difference in the depth of trust in the workplace."
2007-1541,The Media Role in Constructing Israeli Ethiopians' Social Identity in Times of Terror and War,Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Media Role in Constructing Israeli Ethiopians' Social Identity in Times of Terror and War,Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Paper Session,"This study examines attitudes and reactions of Israeli Ethiopian teacher trainees towards media coverage of terrorist acts in Israel shortly after a series of horrific terrorist attacks and following the second Lebanon war. 38 Jewish-Israeli students of Ethiopian descent were asked to describe their most vivid and memorable interactions with mass mediated images of terror events in individual interviews and focused group sessions. The results suggest that media coverage of terrorist incidents was specifically interpreted by Ethiopian students only in view of their personal and cultural spheres, and was not integrated into their Israeli identities or social and national public dialogues. Consequently, media consumption by Ethiopians of terrorism acts both mirrors their integration process and reinforces their marginal status in Israeli society."

The current study employed a solomon 4-group experimental design to investigate the mediating role of realism, similarity, identification and desirability in the effects of exposure to prosocial messages. Participants were 452 college students who viewed one of 9 vignettes depicting negative outcomes resulting from alcohol or substance abuse. Exposure to the messages affected expectancies and efficacy only if mediating perceptions were activated successfully. The results show that campaign designers must consider individual differences in message interpretation processes even within seemingly homogeneous target groups."

Critical analysis of explicit and implied messages in lyrics, track collections, and cover art can cultivate student interest while bringing issues as diverse as political action, sustainability, white privilege, inter-racial and inter-SES communication, and violence in popular culture to the forefront. Poverty of Philosophy provides a powerful message to students whose lives have often not required them to confront these issues. This project explores ways in which teachers may use, students might relate to, and outcomes can be affected by the pedagogical introduction of music as social criticism and call to action."

Any analytic method always incorporates certain assumptions and thus can be validly applied to data that satisfy its assumptions but not those that do not. It also has its own strengths and weakness in extracting information hidden in the data, and therefore may reveal different messages from the same data. In media research, signal detection analysis of recognition memory is a good example.This paper introduces a dynamic signal detection model (DST) developed by Balakrishnan, Busemeyer, MacDonald, and Lin (2001), describes it assumptions, justifies its validity, and empirically demonstrates how this method can help media researchers better understand recognition memory of mediated information."
2007-1545,"""The Misleading ""Management"" in Communication Management: Organizational Communication as a Holistic Alternative",Giving Up Cognitive Control: Public Relations and the Turn to Emotion,,,,Paper,"""The Misleading ""Management"" in Communication Management: Organizational Communication as a Holistic Alternative",Giving Up Cognitive Control: Public Relations and the Turn to Emotion,"Today, the term communication management is popular in the field of public relations. However, we consider this term problematic for several reasons. Firstly, it implies that communication can, in general, be controlled and we feel that such control is feasible only within narrow limits. Secondly, the management perspective blinds communication research towards changes at the macro-level. It narrows research interest to deliberate, intended action by the organization itself (meso- and micro-level) so research tends to be interested in the communication of organizations, but not in communication about organizations happening in the public sphere. After determining the limits of classical management approaches to PR, we develop a view that illuminates organizational communications processes from a multi-dimensional perspective that takes into account the outlook of both organization and recipients."
2007-1546,The Moblilization of Ecoinformation & ICTs by Hawaii Marine Stakeholders,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Moblilization of Ecoinformation & ICTs by Hawaii Marine Stakeholders,Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,"Once thought of as limitless in resources, the worlds oceans are now resembling empty tanks. At the same time, the present structure of a central authority, with a monopoly on information that regulates a passive and limited set of stakeholders, is being challenged. There has been an emerging set of marine stakeholders in Hawaii, who are enabled by technology and whose actions are fueled by an increasing amount and availability of information, fostering the formation of new alliances and partnerships. These stakeholder groups have started to demand a more active role in the management of marine resources. In this paper, we characterize this shift from ocean users to technology-enabled, information-rich, and active stakeholders. We link preliminary findings from ongoing research to theoretical approaches to information and communication technology use in order to describe and understand this new shift among Hawaiis marine stakeholders."
2007-1547,The Modern(?) Korean Woman in Prime Time: Analyzing the Representation of Sun on the Television Series Lost,"On the Screen and Behind the Scenes: Gender, TV, Nation",,,,Paper,The Modern(?) Korean Woman in Prime Time: Analyzing the Representation of Sun on the Television Series Lost,"On the Screen and Behind the Scenes: Gender, TV, Nation","This article investigates the representation of Sun, the most prominent non-White female character on ABCs Lost. Given the importance of Suns character in terms of visibility for Korean women specifically (and Asian women generally) coupled with the fact that Lost under-represents women in general, her role provides a substantial case-study in gender within the science-fiction genre. Through a narrative analysis of the first season, the authors demonstrate the simultaneously flawed and empowered dimensions of Sun, who challenges some of the stereotypes viewers have come to expect from prime time drama, especially within the science fiction genre. Elements of colonialism, interpersonal relationships and the castaway narrative in Lost are also explored."
2007-1548,The Monitorial Citizen: Toward a Theoretical Model,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Monitorial Citizen: Toward a Theoretical Model,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,"With Michael Schudsons historical analysis of American civic life, he and other scholars have proposed the concept of a monitorial citizen to describe the ways in which citizens engage in information-gathering and processing in an era of information abundance. The model, however, remains underdeveloped. This paper seeks to establish a theoretical understanding of monitorial citizenship by first examining evidence of its existence, including the ways in which state, market, and citizens are engaged in monitoring through the symbolic material of daily life. The notion of an active citizen-consumer (a prosumer) is developed, resulting in a form of do-it-yourself (DIY) citizenship that engages a broad array of cultural discourses about politics. The social context of contemporary citizenship, awash as it is in communication technologies, also results in a techno-political habitus that is central to monitorial activity. The paper then seeks to understand why citizens engage in monitorial behavior in the first place, examining both the rational and affective factors associated with social/political surveillance. The paper concludes by arguing that given this broadly cultural nature of monitorial relations between citizens, state, and market, the conception of a monitorial citizen represents a shift in our understanding of the dynamics that shape contemporary civic life."

Using the July 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict as a backdrop, this study reviewed access U.S. military public affairs officers provided the media and analyzed the medias subsequent coverage for the presence of the militarys message, frames, and other relationships. Coverage was more neutral and positive than negative. Items containing organizational messages were more positive; those quoting practitioner-facilitated sources introduced organizational messages into coverage and generated more positive coverage. Access to sources and other information subsidies had a positive impact on coverage and aided in the successful transfer of attribute salience from practitioners to the media."
2007-1550,The Mourning Public: Grief and Identification in an Antigay Murder,"Being Public: Bowling, Murder, and Coming Out",,,,Paper,The Mourning Public: Grief and Identification in an Antigay Murder,"Being Public: Bowling, Murder, and Coming Out","The paper analyzes the media discourse surrounding the murder of Matthew Shepard in 1998. Shepard was the most publicly mourned victim of antigay violence. The paper uses Judith Butlers discussion of the obituary as a political and nationalist genre in order to examine the ways in which Shepard was articulated as not only a mournable body, but as a figure of identification for a broad (gay and straight) public. In doing so, the paper traces both the discursive operations by which a gay man could become iconic within mainstream media, as a national loss and as a quasi-intimate relation to many strangers. These discursive operations take on even greater significance when analyzed within the context of public formation. The invocations of mourning and identification take a central role in the formation of publics around Shepards death, illustrating the need to better understand the role of affective discourse in the public sphere."

Such associations are strongly suggested in both the language pedagogical, and in the intercultural, literature but had been the subject of little empirical investigation. The Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) was identified as a suitable instrument for predicting intercultural effectiveness. The study found that the MPQs Cultural Empathy subscale was highly predictive of language learning ability and achievement, although a new and exploratory subscale, Intergroup Cultural Empathy was slightly better at predicting certain aspects of language learning achievement. Openmindedness, Flexibility and, to a certain extent, Social Initiative were also found to predict language learning achievement. Cultural Empathy, Intergroup Cultural Empathy, Openmindedness and Social Initiative also predicted self-rated language teaching ability. These findings offer support for those who advocate an intercultural approach to language learning and teaching."

Professional and scholarly literature in the last decade has proposed that interactivity would radically change journalism, its professional values, and its routines. The historical origins of these proposals are explored and confronted with the actual practices of online media projects through published empirical research and four case studies selected from an average European region. The study takes an ethnographic approach to online newsrooms working routines to assess the actual role of the myth of interactivity in shaping the development of these four online news projects. The professional culture of traditional journalism has a strong inertia in the online newsrooms that prevents them from developing most of the ideals of interactivity, as they do not fit in the standardized news production routines."

However, there is hardly any research systematically examining the concept in regard to its core theoretical and methodological assumptions. The aims of this study are, first, to present a re-conceptionalization of NFO, and second, to explore the usefulness of a new NFO scale in an agenda setting study. Based on recent theoretical developments in agenda setting theory, three dimensions of NFO are posited: NFO toward issues, NFO toward facts, and NFO toward journalistic evaluations. The existence of these dimensions was tested in a panel survey on the 2002 elections in Germany. These panel data were combined with an extensive content analysis of TV and newspaper coverage. The findings demonstrate the impact of NFO on first and second-level effects. Implications of these results will be discussed in terms of agenda setting theory."

We argue that the core elements of Habermas's mature theory of the public spherethe political system, functional systems, civil society, and lifeworldhave all been transformed by network forms of organization. Our primary focus is on the public sphere itself in its relations to civil society, and particularly on the role of mediated communication in the generation of what Habermas has termed communicative power. To illustrate, we focus on data from comparative studies of social networks of association and likelihood of participation in Bogota, Colombia and Madison, Wisconsin, based on communicative orientation."

This analysis shows how the discourse of public concerns shifts over time in response to US government policy as well as to changing conceptions of the Internet and the Internet economy. While the research located a significant number of news stories demonstrating economic justifications for market regulation, several other themes also emerged, including an increasing sense of anxiety surrounding deregulation in the later years of coverage. These trends in public discourse demonstrate what frames of communication policy were most available during this period. The discourses identified in this paper are significant because they reflect the ambivalence surrounding Internet regulationwhile the Internet and the related technology economy are often framed as necessarily unregulated, there is also a considerable amount of concern in later coverage about how the market processes may not adequately serve the public interest, particularly in the cases of privacy and mergers. While it is impossible to make specific causal claims regarding the relationship between material circumstances and discursive trends, analyzing public discourse is useful because it shows what frames of issues are most available at different historical moments."

One hundred forty-two college undergraduates completed a time/space diary for a randomly assigned week-day in which they recorded their contacts or bundles with members of their personal network. Analysis of the data show that interpersonal media coexist because they are differentiated from each other in their usage patterns. Each medium is used in different time/space/network relationship contexts."

2007-1558,The Only Thing We Have to Fear IsDeath: Using Terror Management Theory to Predict Attitudinal and Behavioral Responses to Death-Explicit Antitobacco PSAs,formation Systems: Persuasion by Negative Emotion,,,,Extended Abstract,The Only Thing We Have to Fear IsDeath: Using Terror Management Theory to Predict Attitudinal and Behavioral Responses to Death-Explicit Antitobacco PSAs,Information Systems: Persuasion by Negative Emotion,"Terror Management Theory (TMT) posits that the primary function underlying human behavior is self-preservation. Humans are uniquely conscious of the fact that they will inevitably die, and death-related thoughts regulate their behaviors. Thoughts of death remove an individuals protection from mortality and make them seek ways to save themselves (Greenberg, Solomon, & Pyszczynski, 1997, p. 72). For example, TMT suggests that when faced with thoughts of their own death, human beings try to control anxiety related to mortality salience by: promoting the beliefs and values of their culture (cultural worldview defense); showing aggression toward and suggesting punishments for those outside their social group; changing behaviors to comply with social norms; overestimating the number of people who agree with their views. This study uses a 2 (death threat/nondeath message) x 2 (smoker/nonsmoker) between-subjects experiment wherein participants are exposed to either 10 death-explicit or 10 nondeath antitobacco PSAs, and complete self-report measures of emotional response, anxiety, cultural worldview defense, smoking blame, behavioral intent, and perception of smoking consensus following. To the extent that death-related thoughts can influence the self-regulatory process, reminders of our mortality can have a significant effect on the way individuals respond. Previous TMT findings indicate that feelings of anxiety and arousal often occur when death is made salient. We expect our findings regarding death-explicit antitobacco PSAs to support the premise that death-related thoughts function as a motivating force in performing antitobacco behaviors. Thus, death-explicit PSAs can be used to motivate health promotion and disease prevention."

As an example, research in interpersonal compliance-seeking behavior slowed dramatically when theory failed to predict behaviorally observed differential selection of message strategies based upon situation perception. We argue that cognitive perspectives explain this apparent lack of findings. A brief empirical study is provided to illustrate the argument. We generalize these findings to argue that theory often serves as metatheory: explaining the circumstances under which a primary theory operates."

Nevertheless, clinical evidence gathered over the last three decades has suggested that the right hemisphere is essential for language competency through its contribution in modulating the emotional aspects of communication through affective prosody and gestures. Unlike the aphasic syndromes, the organization of affective prosody in the brain has remained controversial because affective-prosodic deficits may occur after left or right brain damage. However, evidence will be presented to support the following concepts 1) affective prosody is a dominant and lateralized function of the right hemisphere, 2) the intrahemispheric organization of affective prosody in the right hemisphere, with the partial exception of repetition, is analogous to the organization of propositional language in the left hemisphere and 3) the aprosodic syndromes are cortically-based as part of evolutionary adaptations underlying human language and communication."

First, I review the literature of foreign news, and second, trace the historical and cultural contexts of foreign news in newspaper and television in Japan. Then, I reveal foreign news in Japan a manifested form of dimensional consciousness and demonstrate how it is revealed in the magic, mythical, and perspectival consciousnesses. While previous studies have attempted to understand foreign news in either behavioristic or political-economic orientations, this study unfolds what constitutes foreign news and how it comes to appear in human consciousness."
2007-1563,The Origins of Licensing: The Navy's 1905 Bill,"Chronicling the Past: Memory, Maps, Marconi, and Money",,,,Paper,The Origins of Licensing: The Navy's 1905 Bill,"Chronicling the Past: Memory, Maps, Marconi, and Money","This paper draws on archival research to analyze the U.S. Navys push for licensing wireless telegraph stations in the 1899-1905 period. By 1905, when the Navy submitted the first wireless bill to Congress, the main contours of the approach that would lead to the enactment of licensing in the Radio Act of 1912 had already developed. The Navys push for licensing is best understood as a complex mixture of straightforward military and broader geopolitical considerations. Since the first wireless company operating on U.S. soil, the Marconi Company, was a subsidiary of a British corporation, its activities immediately raised the specter of extending British control over international communication to the new technology. While naval policymakers did not yet have the full-blown strategy with regard to liberating American radio from foreign influence that would later result in the establishment of RCA and an assortment of foreign ownership regulations, geopolitical concerns did play a key part in their decisions, which makes this case essential for understanding the development of the Navys position over time. Ironically, perhaps, this study also contributes to understanding the difficulties of regulating under conditions of convergence. Licensing was originally designed for a point-to-point industry. When it was uncritically transferred over to broadcasting, ignoring the substantial differences between the two uses of radio technology, the problems it created were at least as important as the ones it solved."

This presentation will outline the major socio-technical challenges for the successful development, deployment, and growth of social and knowledge networking tools as part of the cyberinfrastructure to empower issue politics networking. Specifically, the presentation will identify challenges for NGOs and other organizations engaged in a wide range of activities such as tobacco control, obesity control, disaster response, economic resilience and immigrant communities. The presentation extends Monge & Contractor's (2003) multi-theoretical multilevel model (MTML) for the emergence of communication networks by identifying new theoretical and methodological challenges (and opportunities) to measure, understand and enable the social dynamics among the human and non-human agents that comprise these issue networks."
2007-1565,"The Other Algeria: Zidane, World Cup Soccer, Globalization, and the Media",Global News in Local Context,,,,Paper,"The Other Algeria: Zidane, World Cup Soccer, Globalization, and the Media",Global News in Local Context,"In the study of global media flows, one of the central concerns is balance in quantity, quality, and access to information. This paper explores the discourses produced around French team captain Zinédine Zidanes head butt of Italian defensive player Marco Materazzi during the 2006 World Cup Final pitting France against Italy. Elite discourses from the French and Algerian presses focused on their respective national identities, while public reactions were very limited, concentrating on violence and racial portrayals. Both elite and popular discourses suggest a serious marginalization of Algeria in the global media flows stemming from this event. This study further finds the market for satellite broadcasts, in its relatively unfettered state is not adequate for the possibility of national identity negotiation. Combining critical discourse analysis with political economic analysis allows us to uncover a continuing process of marginalization that influences the development of countries such as Algeria."
2007-1566,The Other Halo Effect: A Cultural Comparison of Aggression Following Violent Video Play,A Closer Look at Violent Video Games: Beyond the Simple Effects Paradigm,,,,Paper,The Other Halo Effect: A Cultural Comparison of Aggression Following Violent Video Play,A Closer Look at Violent Video Games: Beyond the Simple Effects Paradigm,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether levels of aggression experienced after violent video game play are affected by one's culture. The study looks at cultural dimensions of individualism and collectivism separately, to explore whether these 2 dimensions are either positively or negatively associated with cognitive, verbal, and physical aggression. Participants (N = 45) were recruited from a large Pacific university and asked to play Halo, a popular violent video game, for 15 minutes. After video play, participants were asked to complete questionnaires which measured the 3 types of aggression and culture. After analyzing scores on the individualism and collectivism measures, correlational coefficients were computed between the culture and aggression variables. The results indicate that high individualism is associated with high levels of cognitive and behavioral aggression, whereas high collectivism was related to low levels of cognitive and verbal aggression."
2007-1567,The Paradox of the Positive: A Flaw in Public Relations Practice,Public Relations Response Strategies,,,,Paper,The Paradox of the Positive: A Flaw in Public Relations Practice,Public Relations Response Strategies,"The paradox of the positive is an imperfection in discourse that is most evident when people in positions of power make public, upbeat announcements of actions they are taking or policies and programs they are implementing that are supposed to produce good and favorable outcomes for the publics who they (both those in powerful positions and the actions, policies and programs) represent. This flaw is revealed in statements that stress the positive side of some matter, while potentially marginalizing alternative perspectives. As support for the presence of this paradox and its prevalence in public relations practice, the authorsusing close textual analysisexamine Cincinnatis statements applauding urban renewal which champion the revival of the inner city but arguably alienate marginalized populations by not including and even masking their interests in the positive advances framed in the language. This flaw has even greater potential of alienation when it is employed by public relations experts as boosterism on behalf of government officials and development groups."

Considerable research has emerged on the impact of these media formats on journalism. Rare in the literature, however, are studies of what nonjournalists, in fact, produce when given the unbridled power to craft and publish news stories. Thus, this paper focuses on the emergent Web-based format called citizen journalism. The paper begins by presenting a theoretical framework within which to consider citizen journalism and then examines, through a textual analysis of stories published on a popular citizen journalism site, this user-driven medium in practice. The study is guided by the following questions: What dominant narratives exist in citizen journalism? What do these narratives emphasize and omit? What do these narratives portend for mainstream journalism? Findings from an analysis of more than 300 submissions indicate that the overwhelming majority of stories fall under one of 2 master news narratives: the pastoral hero and the good mother. The central characters in these master narratives are apolitical. Story submissions tend to depict the pastoral hero and good mother in the context of family, religion, school or leisure, with very few submissions on government or civic responsibility and even fewer that depict conflict or deviance. Implications of these findings will be discussed."

The aim is to facilitate the frequently tedious and unsatisfactory search for specialist articles, papers, doctoral theses, studies, abstracts or books. An experiment with a single-factor design was performed in order to examine empirically the performance of Google Scholar in the search for scientific information. Specifically, the research topics related to the search for information, firstly according to the quality criteria for television programmes established by Winfried Schatz and Heribert Schulz (1992) and, secondly, to the media performance approach devised by Denis McQuail (1992). In the case of the three-level independent variable the general search engine Google was selected as one of the two control conditions alongside the experimental condition. Traditional research in a specialist library of relevance to the two study topics, including the search in the electronic library catalogue, served as the second control condition. The results of the experiment clearly indicate greater success using the general search engine Google in comparison with the specialized offering for scientific searches, Google Scholar, and the specialist library. It must be stated that the performance of Google Scholar at the time of the study is still unsatisfactory. This state of affairs is attributable to the index which is incomplete and unsuited to scientific research in many disciplines, to limitations placed on the result lists due to cost-incurring and password protected documents, to non-utilizable search results (citations in other publications, books that are only available offline in libraries) and to the technically imperfect operating or search-limitation options."

These visual interruptions create change blindness. Change blindness is a phenomenon that occurs when an individual does not notice a change in the environment after some form of visual interruption which includes, a camera change, a door passing between two people, or a pan within a scene (just to give a few examples). This study is using the Limited Capacity Model of Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP) and applying it to change blindness. Change blindness may be an error of encoding, storage, or retrieval. Although there are number of factors which may affect change blindness this study focuses on 2 motivational relevance and size of change. Results suggest an interaction between motivational relevance and size of change for aversive stimuli that create change blindness. The type of interaction is different for encoding, storage, and retrieval."
2007-1571,The Persuasiveness of Online Safety Cues,Best of Information Systems Division,,,,Paper,The Persuasiveness of Online Safety Cues,Best of Information Systems Division,"Safety cues are frequently used in online stores to relieve consumers risk perceptions concerning online purchases. This paper applies regulatory focus theory (RFT) to predict the persuasiveness of online safety cues. According to RFT (Higgins, 1997) people process information processing differentially depending on whether they strive for achieving gains (promotion focus) or avoiding losses (prevention focus). The aim of the current study is to examine the impact of the regulatory focus compatibility of web content on online consumer behavior. In 2 experiments we show that the effect of online safety cues depends on the consumers regulatory focus. Study 1 shows that safety-oriented web content lowers consumers risk perceptions, but only when in a prevention focus. Study 2 replicates and extends this finding by showing that depending on the regulatory focus online safety cues both lower consumers risk perceptions and engender more favorable attitudes toward the website and the online retailer. Theoretical and practical implications will be discussed."

Paid critics must perform a specialized kind of labor to warrant reward for their analysis, thus they must exercise professional vision. In a sense, all popular media analysis is reception analysis; the only difference is which audience (paid or unpaid) is the focus of the reception analysis. The essay examines a series of studies of the television show Will & Grace to illustrate how the political economy of textual criticism motivates counter-intuitive (and typically negative) assessments of the show, while audience-centered research has generated almost exactly opposite results."

The impetus for the present investigation was to explore why this may be the case; specifically, this semiotic analysis of photographs depicting the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib seeks to explore what the images, and the scandal itself, mean. Conclusions drawn include the argument that the photographs of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib both enabled and disabled discourse about the abuse of detainees in the Global War on Terror. In a culture (contemporary American) where seeing is believing, the photographs, on the one hand, placed the reality of the abuse in a familiar and preferred frame of reference, making their impact upon Americans widespread, immediate, and forceful. On the other hand, the ability of the photographic message to mean without context, combined with a preference for the visual message in obtaining information in the modern media environment, produced conditions conducive to the photographs becoming the story, rather than proof of systemic abuse."

The focus rests on the interaction between private and public/popular spheres, as it relates to the journalistic coverage of Swedish feminist politician Tiina Rosenberg and the political association Feminist Initiative (Fi). A consistent leitmotif in the media discourse is the portrayal of Tiina Rosenberg as deviant, and the equation of feminism and radicalism with extremism. On a more general level Tiina Rosenberg appears to have a condensing function that extends beyond the rational political culture, where the media construction of Fi-Tiina clearly has the character of symbolic excess. Here, one key factor is the abscence of political self-styling. To present one self, as Tiina Rosenberg did, to the public without a strategic political self, left the field open for other actors to construct her in any way they wanted. Instead of representing a new political project, she became a focus for projections of potent emotional reactions in defense of traditional norms."

It asks, in the age of 24-hour coverage, how does the mainstream media turn a public official into a celebrity and what impact, if any, does the process of celebrification have on more traditional political coverage? The present research examines coverage of Condoleezza Rice and Barack Obama in three magazines and three newspapers during four months following the 2004 election. It considers how media frame politicians as knowns by utilizing backstory, and in turn, how this impacts the relationship between an audience member and mediated individual, thus parasocial relations. Findings suggest a framing continuum in the celebrification of politicians, from traditional hard news mold to celebrity-style coverage. In addition, findings also indicate issues of gender framing in political news coverage."

Policymaking dealing with the principles of diversity and localism has been particularly vulnerable to an increased politicization of the research process by policymakers, which has affected all aspects of the role of research in policymaking, ranging from the nature of the data gathered by regulatory bodies, to policymaker attention and inattention to particular streams of research, to the process by which researchers are selected to contribute to the policy research process. This politicization creates an environment of cynicism around the research process that may lead researchers to disengage and that may compromise the credibility of the entire policy research enterprise. The end result is a return to the more rhetorically-based approaches to policymaking that characterized the pre-evidence-based policymaking era, with research serving as a rhetorical element of competing policy claims."
2007-1577,The Politics of Fear and Reassurance,Affect in Public Life: Mediating Conflict and Terrorism,,,,Paper,The Politics of Fear and Reassurance,Affect in Public Life: Mediating Conflict and Terrorism,"The media have often been blamed for perpetuating a climate of fear, more recently in relation to terrorism. This paper discusses affect and the emotions at the level of everyday life and argues that the discussion of generalized fear and anxiety has to take into account the medias parallel role in catalysing feelings of security and trust. These are parallel processes and need not be seen as necessarily contradictory. After addressing the different theoretical approaches on fear together with the conceptual distinctions between fear as a response to a physical threat, generalised or ambient fear and anxiety, the paper, drawing on fieldwork in 30 London households will discuss the dialectical articulation of fear and reassurance in peoples consumption of the news."

These texts are drawn from print, television and radio sources, and represent the way in which language-use became a site of struggle and contestation in a mediatized public debate over the meaning of a single word, refugee. From the perspective of folk linguistics and critical discourse analysis, this paper looks at the way peoples talk about language-use and the meanings of words can reveal their ideological beliefs both about the role of language in society and about wider political and social categories. It demonstrates the ways in which everyday language-use in media coverage of Hurricane Katrina constructed an understanding of refugee that was both problematic and contested, while it also revealed popular understandings of the category citizen. These categories then became a way for people to talk about issues of racism and poverty in the context of the natural disaster, and a successful (in some ways) challenge to media practices that usually silence and obscure such issues. Drawing on theories of globalization, migration and mobility, this study connects the local-level meaning-making surrounding Hurricane Katrina to global discourses of refugees in particular and human mobility in general."
2007-1579,The Politics of Science: Communication and Opinion Formation About Scientific Issues and Policies,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Politics of Science: Communication and Opinion Formation About Scientific Issues and Policies,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Using national survey data, we examine how people use science media, factual knowledge related to nanotechnology, and predispositions such as strength of religious beliefs, to form attitudes about nanotechnology. We show that strength of religious beliefs is negatively related to support for funding of the technology. Our findings also confirm that science media use plays an important role in shaping positive attitudes toward the technology. Finally, we demonstrate how people distinguish between supporting policies that are personally or politically relevant for them, such as increases in federal funding, and their support for nanotechnology more abstractly. Overall public support for nanotechnology will not depend on levels of knowledge among the electorate, but on simple rules of thumb or heuristics, such as risk and benefits perceptions or other media frames. And as our study showed, these heuristics or frames tend to be interpreted through the lens of religious beliefs. Public support for funding for nanotechnology, however, will to some extent be related to levels of factual knowledge."

In addition to helping us understand the role of technology, postmodern organizational theory, among others, also challenges modernist perspectives on organizational power, structure, strategy formulation, roles, and organizational discourse, and how these concepts are applied in public relations theory and practice."

To what extent does the adoption of these new technologies affect our democracies and power relations within our societies? Are these new technologies increasing opportunities for free cultural expression and for participation for groups hitherto on the margins of society, or rather are they simply reinforcing existing patterns of inequality? These and other similar questions have been addressed to varying extents and in different contexts. There is a lack of consensus in existing academic literature on the impact of new media technologies, where there is a tendency to focus either on opportunities or on dangers.This paper tries to lay the theoretical and methodological framework for a study of how ethnic minority youth in Oslo incorporate the ICTs in their everyday lives in ways that are meaningful to them, and the extent to which practices related to the use of ICTs can constitute forms of empowerment."

Literature on gaze' reflects the subordination of women, particularly Asian women compared to the Western women. Given the changing trends in the empowerment of women and advertising, this study through a content analysis of visuals over a period of eight years in For Him Magazine (FHM), Singapore examines gaze in the portrayal of men and women, their social roles and societal relationships. The interesting results reflect a change in the trend, where over the years more women than men are gazing directly into the camera and there are significant relationships between the types of visuals, race of models, and modes of dressing between men and women."

Results revealed that viewers acquired knowledge from the content of each drama, despite the fact that some content was inaccurate. Viewers who were not organ donors prior to exposure to the dramas were more likely to decide to donate organs if the drama explicitly encouraged donation, portrayed characters revealing how they had become donors and discussed the merits of donating. Viewers were also more likely to become an organ donor if they were emotionally involved in the drama. Viewers who were organ donors prior to exposure were less likely to be influenced by the storylines and possessed more accurate knowledge than nondonors. Implications for using dramas to educate and motivate the public were discussed."

These 2 approaches were used to examine the behavioral intention to limit drinking to 0 to 4 drinks. Further, this study examined whether perception of subjective norms, university and U.S. level descriptive norms, and university and U.S. level injunctive norms represented separate dimensions for this behavioral intention. A representative sample of 1110 college students completed a web-based survey. The results confirmed that the 5 types of norms were all unique constructs. This study also found that individuals intentions to limit their alcohol consumption to 0 to 4 drinks were predicted by positive attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms. Subjective norms also moderated the relationship between attitudes and behavioral intention. University descriptive norms also served as a moderator. This study has important implications for future normative interventions."

Specifically, this paper uses priming theory to predict that subjects exposed to negative images of the Iraq war will have lower perceptions as to the effectiveness of the war that those exposed to positive images of the Iraq war. Results showed that subjects exposed to the negative priming condition were less supportive of the military effort in Iraq and felt less confident as to the success of the war effort than those exposed to the positive priming condition. However, there was no difference between the two groups in regards to their perceptions as to the number of causalities of the Iraq war. Results of this study and implications for future research are discussed."

Children of nature? Indian princesses? Defilers of white virgins? These are a few of the persistent stereotypes used in the media, particularly in advertising and product branding, that feature images and attributes of Native Americans. Sue Bee Honey, Land OLakes dairy products, and Jeep Cherokee are contemporary examples of the commodification of racist representations. How and why pictorial metaphors of North American Indians on commercially produced product labels and promotions create and perpetuate commodified stereotypes is the focus of this chapter. In particular, I view these representations in and on consumer goods as a lens through which we can see how race is commodified and how stereotypes are reified. Grant McCrackens Meaning Transfer Model and Roland Barthes semiotic analysis serve as the framework and method of analysis for four illustrative national brands. I expand on McCrackens framework by acknowledging the role of the viewer in the process and add a reinforcement loop from the consumer back to the culture in which these stereotypes are constructed, experienced, and recirculated through the American (and global) system of goods and services."

This question is addressed by analyzing the Channel One TV news coverage over the course of three school years, from September 2003 to May 2006. Channel One TV is a corporate-owned news broadcast transmitted to 7 million teenagers daily, comprising 30 percent of U.S. teenagers. This investigation found that the news service did provide ample coverage of certain political institutions, issues, and major events, such as the presidential campaign. However, some of the framing was problematic as it amplified political problem definitions and solutions that emanated from a corporate, militaristic, or conservative point of view."

Canonical texts such as Tuchmans Making News showed that organizational dynamics shape differences in journalists categorical work and editorial routines for hard and soft news, but also the existence of a significant level of editorial, organizational and technological common ground. This and other texts helped established the still dominant notion that, borrowing from Zelizer, the differences between hard and soft news are of degree rather than kind. In this paper I will argue that this notion no longer accurately depicts contemporary dynamics in, at least part of, the journalistic field. Drawing from an ethnographic study of Argentinas largest online newspaper, I will describe the divergent logics that govern the production of hard and soft news, explain why these differences of kind have emerged, and reflect on the studys larger implications for theory development."

Inherent to this idea is the prefiguring of a new relationship between media producer and audience. Drawing upon new social movement theory and critical media studies, the framework of prefigurative media paints a picture of what nonhierarchical, truly democratic media can look like. From new social movement theory the ideas of collective identity within social movements and the formation of affective bonds within movements are offered as a guide to the new type of relationship that people can have with media. From critical media studies, the idea that media can be used to bring about political and cultural freedom point the way to the possibilities of prefigurative media. The Independent Media Center movement, which was born at the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle is offered as an exemplar of what prefigurative media may look like."
2007-1591,"The Public Sphere, the Field of Power, and Comparative-Historical Research: The Intermediary Sphere of Society","Public Reasoning, ""Truth,"" and Power",,,,Paper,"The Public Sphere, the Field of Power, and Comparative-Historical Research: The Intermediary Sphere of Society","Public Reasoning, ""Truth,"" and Power","Referring to the ICA 2006 keynote speech, this paper conceptually takes a path not taken in social science, marked by John Dewey, C. Wright Mills, Jürgen Habermas and pragmatist thought more generally. Particularly Mills suggested the structural transformation of the public sphere as an alternative framework for com-munication and media studies. This paper lays out a conceptual map for this framework by linking public sphere theory with contemporary social theory and with established comparative-historical research traditions. To address these disconnections, the oscillating meaning of the term public sphere must be differentiated into its broader and its narrower sense: broadly, as the sphere of public communication; and narrowly, as the capacity for reasoned collective choice. The paper argues that the sphere of public communication as an intermediary sphere between the private sphere of everyday life and the different fields of society is analogous to the public part of Bourdieus understudied notion of the field of power as an encompassing sphere between the different fields of society. Fur-thermore, this paper asks how to overcome the disconnection from the established traditions of comparative-historical research. It suggests that the different traditions can be bridged through the study of diffusion processes in the sphere of public communication in general and the study of its capacity for reasoned collective choice in particular. The paper provides an analytical framework for the study of the structural conditions of these diffusion processes by bringing together conceptual tools from various theory and research traditions."
2007-1592,The Quest for a European Public Sphere: News Media and Democratic Legitimacy,The Public Sphere,,,,Paper,The Quest for a European Public Sphere: News Media and Democratic Legitimacy,The Public Sphere,"This paper critically discusses the normative criteria commonly used to assess the emergence of a European Public Sphere and presents the results of a comparative, long-term, multidimensional content analysis of national quality newspapers in five European countries to test these criteria (A, D, DK, F, and GB, 1982-2003). In the first part, four normative models of Europeanization are advanced and partly revised. In particular, it is argued that a European public sphere cannot do without some degree of mutual observation and exchange between countries as well as some collective identification with Europe; coverage of EU institutions and policies in the national media is not enough. In the second part content analytic data on all of these dimensions is presented. Unlike other studies, this paper identifies a complex pattern of segmented Europeanization due to its multidimensional design: While EU coverage does increase over the past two decades, mutual observation and exchange as well as collective identification stagnate. Proposals for future research on both the reasons and the consequences of this pattern are advanced in conclusion."

Specifically, we examine the degree of centralization that emerges in task-based and nontask-based communication patterns during task and nontask periods in a task-based group. The study also examines the prominence of the group leader in task vs. nontask- based communication. We found group task-based communication to be more centralized in high- and medium-stress periods than low-stress periods. The group leader was highly central (Freemans degree centrality) in task-based but not nontask-based communication activity."

But beyond the personal meaning, quilts hold communal values. Though considered simply a womans craft, quilting can uphold important cultural, religious, and even political values. Focusing on the history and reading quilts like texts inform us of the value systems of a given group. This paper will attempt to explain both what makes a Hawaiian quilt and its importance. To do such, the paper will focus not only how the missionaries introduced quilting but how native adoption of the skill was often subversive. Missionaries had specific expectations for the use of fabric and quilting that held both religious and gendered meanings. However, native Hawaiians adopted only certain aspects. The historical situation of quilting in Hawaii had unique implications for women and for native culture. Recent efforts by the Hawaiian sovereignty movement have tied the need for political independence with cultural distinction and thus cultural markers (like quilting) gain greater significance. Though the West gained influence in the islands over aspects like religion, politics, and culture, the Hawaiian quilt continued to voice the beliefs of native identity."

The Radio Diaries program is broadcast nationally and regionally on six stations. Each week, one of the two HIV-positive diarists in each station discusses his or her experience living as an HIV-positive person. Broadcasts are designed to show that HIV-positive persons are no different from the larger population in terms of their daily lives, struggles, and experiences. This presentation discusses one component of the results from the midterm evaluation of the BRIDGE project  effects of the Radio Diaries program, almost a year after the broadcasts began. It discusses the challenges in measuring exposure to the program, and it introduces three separate measures of program exposure: (a) number of episodes listened to, (b) number of times tuned in to the program, and (c) the style of listening. Although the inter-correlations among the three items were high (rs ranging from .71 to .77, all ps < .001), their ability to predict stigma (measured as perceived similarity between oneself and an HIV-positive person and ones openness to talk about HIV/AIDS) varied considerably from one measure of exposure to another. The best predictor was the third measure of exposure  radio listening style  which assessed how the listener listened: (1) the program was in the background, (2) paid some attention while doing something else, (3) paid quite a bit of attention, and (4) listened very closely without doing anything else. The presentation will discuss how the quantity and quality of exposure may differ from each other."

This study traces the development of video games in China and then investigates them from perspectives of cultural studies and political economy. It is argued that globalization and cultural proximity play different roles in 2 distinct markets: single PC game and online game. This study suggests China has a strengthening homegrown game industry dominated by nonstate players, and the state assumes various roles to cope with the new social medium as well as a billion dollar business: monitoring and regulating the market, facilitating homegrown game industry, and incorporating video games into its own nation-building agenda. The study is concluded with two trends that 1) China rises from a pure market for foreign games to become a possible center of online game export in the regional geocultural market; 2) Chinese online game giants attempt to expand into domestic traditional media sectors, and may collided with the authoritarian state."

This neo-romanticism presents resistance as a subversive field, which is positioned opposite hegemony. This construction of resistance was criticized and rearticulated recently in the field of media studies. Especially the studies on reality television use a fragmented concept of resistance. In this paper, the concept of resistance is rearticulated as part of a hegemonic discourse and the notions of partial and potential resistance are introduced to construct a theoretical insight in the concept of resistance in relation to reality television formats. Using agency/structure and active/passive as dimensions of resistance, a model of resistance with the ability of incorporation will be elaborated. This rearticulated concept will be used in a case study on reality television as a critique of hegemony."
2007-1598,"The Relation Between Suspense and Emotions  Poor Cousins or Identical Twins? Emotional Experiences of The Italian Job""",Measuring Reactions to Visuals,,,,Paper,"The Relation Between Suspense and Emotions  Poor Cousins or Identical Twins? Emotional Experiences of The Italian Job""",Measuring Reactions to Visuals,"Emotional responses to media messages seem to be crucial to catch on selection, processing, evaluation and impact of media content (e.g. Tannenbaum, 1978: 184; Ravaja, 2004). Similarly, respondents report that suspense is a vital motive for media usage (e.g. Brewer 1996: 115f; Neckermann 2001: 521; Vorderer 1997: 241). Even though several theorists mention a relation between both concepts (e.g. Carroll 1996, Zillmann 1980; 1991, Brewer, 1996, Mikos 1996), little research has in fact explicitly dealt with the question if and how these two concepts are linked (Zillmann, 1991). Therefore our main research question addresses the relationship between suspense and emotion: Is suspense a form of emotion? If not  which emotions accompany the experience of suspense? To answer these questions, we have to compare the emotional responses to the experience of suspense evolving during media exposure. Online-monitoring of pleasantness and activation gives us the opportunity to describe the dynamics of emotional responses (Larsen & Diener, 1992; Ravaja, 2004). Against this background we conducted an experimental study where we acquired the skin conductance level of the subjects as an indicator for arousal/activation. One group expressed their feelings of pleasantness via continuous response measurement (CRM; Biocca, David & West, 1994) while watching the first 25 minutes of the thriller The Italien Job. The other group used the CRM-slider to express their suspense. We can now indicate where in the course of exposure suspense is correlated with which emotional state. Results show that suspense is correlated with negative emotions (like fear) during exposure followed by tension release. Whereas in the moment of feeling suspension negative emotions seem to play a crucial role, postreceptive mostly positive emotions seem to have an impact on remembered suspense: Asked after the exposure, subjects report mostly having felt positive emotions and simultaneously they report having been taken in by the action. In sum, suspense and emotions seem to be linked in many ways (e.g. Carroll, 1996): While watching a movie, suspense is associated throughout with negative emotions; this finding is consistent with Mikos (1996) conception of suspense as an experience between fear and pleasure. Besides, suspense seems to be a meta-concept as well: After exposure, it becomes a label for a felicitous reception experience."
2007-1599,The Relationship Between Video Game Flow and Structure,Game Studies Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Relationship Between Video Game Flow and Structure,Game Studies Interactive Paper Session,"Psychological flow has often been reported in the sport and media literatures and as a result of or simultaneous with video game play. The structural characteristics of gaming have been much studied as well, but the point of this inquiry is to ask are there structural characteristics of games that are more or less likely to be associated with the experience of psychological flow during game play? Structural preferences and self reports of flow during play were gathered. As in previous research, hardcore gamers reported more experiences of flow during gaming as well as more specific structural preferences. However, in factor analysis of the flow and structural preferences scales no relationship was found. Thus it may be that all types of video game play can result in experiences of flow."

To directly address this issue, this study examined the reliability and stability of general media exposure measures using the National Survey of Parents and Youth (NSPY), an in-home survey 4-round panel study of children (aged 9-18) and their parents living in the United States. Using a SEM model developed by Wiley and Wiley (1970), we found that for youth, the measures showed moderate reliability, with underlying variables showing moderate to high stability. For parents, reliability was moderate, but underlying variable stability was quite high. The implications of the findings for future research in this area were discussed."

In Sob Sisters: The Image of the Female Journalist in Popular Culture, Joe SaltzmanDirector of USCs Image of the Journalist in Popular Culturesays: For the last 70 years, the best-known female reporter sob sister has been Lois Lane of the Daily Planet who, with Clark Kent, fights for truth and justice in the best newspaper tradition. As an enduring icon and archetype in comic books and cartoons, on television, and in movies, Lois Lanea cartoon character even when portrayed by flesh-and-blood actresseshas influenced generations of devotees perceptions of women in journalism. And her relationship with her longtime dualistic and distant lover has influenced fans real-life romances.

Superman Returnsthe latest Superman franchise offeringpresents a 21st Century Lois Lane fans have never before seen: a Pulitzer Prize-winner (""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"") and single mom to a child whose biological father might be the Man of Steel, who has been away from Earth for five years while Lois has remained at the conglomeratized Planet. After tracing the evolution of the Lois Lane character (ending with the woefully mis-cast Kate Bosworth in the 2006 role), this analysis will use media critic Galicians Seven-Step Dis-illusioning Directions to identify and critique myths and stereotypes in Superman Returns, including what Saltzman describes as the perfect battleground of the sexes, a scenario in which the underrated girl reporter could prove she was as capable as the male, and the boy reporter could gloat that no girl could possibly keep pace with him."

The intellectual ground for the most liberal of these movements is the Mutazila or Rationalist tradition dating from the 8th century, whose modern interpreters include Fazlur Rahman, Mohammed Arkoun, Fatima Mernissi and Hassan Hanafi. This paper discusses how the thinking of these Arab and Islamic theorists constitute the vanguard of the so-called Islamic Reformation; it then moves to a discussion of the discourse of equal rights in Morocco and how the womens movement and human rights organizations have persuaded the King of Morocco to revise the Mudawana (Family Code) in favor of women and children. Focus is on the kings 2003 speech Equal Rights for All, which reveals how this revision is embedded in a nationalist rhetoric that actually legitimizes ongoing repression and criminalization of dissidents."

Sometimes, however, we dont want to be in the best but in the right mood. For example, before taking an important exam, a student might listen to classical music to increase concentration, even though listening to distracting heavy metal music would make him/her feel much better. Not only individual tasks instigate such mood adjustment behavior during media use, also anticipated social interactions will often induce efforts to adapt one's own mood. Conceptualization of these processes has been elaborated in the mood adjustment approach and will be presented with empirical evidence. Existing empirical insights have shown that the genders differ remarkably in their mood adjustment goals and patterns and that media stimuli as different as music and online news are employed to adjust moods."
2007-1604,The Rights of Journalism and the Universal Right to Know?,Journalism and Human Rights,,,,Paper,The Rights of Journalism and the Universal Right to Know?,Journalism and Human Rights,"The paper will question accepted beliefs concerning the function of journalists as providers of truth. It will reason, and empirically demonstrate, that the idea of the right to know as some kind of universal truth is for the most part occupational ideology rather than a product of popular will. The intention of the paper is to collapse the myth of a profession whose existence is for the common good, and as such has special rights of access to information. The right to know, although often justified in terms of democratic theory, has in principle functioned as a mechanism for the aggrandisement of a profession affording it special status and privileges. As an occupational ideology it has served the profession well: it has increased its power of entry to public and private life, and given respect, in the sense of accord, by policy makers, indeed, in certain instances actually shaping foreign policy by its open coverage of events. Yet, as the findings from focus groups and the findings from a nationally representative survey will show the journalists belief in their right to report openly from conflict zones is not shared by the public to which the journalists are supposedly serving. The conclusion is that a disjuncture exists between beliefs that the journalists hold about rights to know and what the public consider the journalist has a right to report. The right to know, from the empirical findings, is not a universal or uncontested right, and looks more the expression of a sectionalised group interest, namely, that of an occupation."

In this multilevel model, I propose that transformational change triggers sensemaking at the individual and organizational levels. Given the interactive nature of emotion and cognition, sensemaking affects the emotions that organizational members experience and vice versa. With the moderating role of appropriate communication strategies, a shared understanding is reached between organizational members and top management regarding transformational change. This shared understanding is negotiated through the communication between an organization and its members, which can lead to positive emotions felt by organizational members. Positive emotions that organizational members feel ultimately result in behavioral reactions instrumental to change, such as change participation, collaboration, and learning. Although emotion is not the only variable that affects behavioral responses toward change, it is nevertheless an important guide for human action."

The present research investigates the extent to which interactivity of mediated communication, specifically interactivity of the Web site, influences individuals stereotypes and attitudes toward stereotyped issues, such as stereotypes of mental illness. The results from an experiment, in which the user control and responsiveness dimensions of interactivity were manipulated, showed that interactivity had significant moderating effects on knowledge acquisition, attitudes and behavior intentions relating to people with mental illness, while task involvement mediated the effects on these outcomes. Findings of this research provide implications for future research and campaigns on mental illness stigma."

Findings suggest that, cross-sectionally, individuals who spend more time using media have a stronger agreement on important public issues within the social groups to which they belong than those who spend less. Findings also suggest that, longitudinally, when the same individuals increase their newspaper reading, agreement on important public issues within the social groups to which they belong increases to a higher level of consensus. In consistent with Shaw and Martins 1992 study, this study shows empirical evidence for the one major function of mass media: enhance group consensus within the larger social system."

Based on a nation-wide sample of more than 3,000 Chinese children 6-18 years old, this study investigates the relationship between the childrens body weight and the time they spent watching TV or playing video games. While most of the studies in other countries have found a positive relationship between TV watching and childrens body weight, this study found no such relationship among the Chinese children. The authors speculate that it was probably because Chinese children on average spent much less time watching TV than their counterparts in the developed countries, so TV watching in China has not reached a level where it can significantly affect childrens body weight. Further, this study finds that gender plays an important role: the boys who spend more time with TV and video games tend to be thinner, while watching TV or playing video games are not clearly correlated with the girls body weight."
2007-1612,The Role of Media in International Conflicts: A Long-Term Analysis of Israels Media Image in International TV News,News Framing and International Conflicts: Contexts and Impacts,,,,Paper,The Role of Media in International Conflicts: A Long-Term Analysis of Israels Media Image in International TV News,News Framing and International Conflicts: Contexts and Impacts,"Since the Gulf War of 1990 the media arena has become increasingly important for parties in conflict  especially in asymmetric wars. International TV focuses on a restricted range of conflicts, following an independent logic, influenced by self-referentiality and the availability of footage. The interplay of these factors leads to stereotyping of conflicts and its participants. This paper analyzes the media coverage of Israel in international TV news, looking at the topic and protagonist structures as well as the tone of coverage. Reporting about Israel has been dominated by reporting about Israeli military activities or terrorist acts against Israeli civilians in the context of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The Israeli Defense Force has been in the focus of more than 40% of news reports in 4 German TV news shows in the period from July 2001 to July 2006. Issues not related to this conflict are mostly absent from the news. As a consequence, the evaluation of Israeli protagonists has been consistently negative for the last six years with the exception of the first half of 2005. Long-standing negativity in turn influences the development of conflicts, as the opponents instrumentalize media for their conflict strategy. In the 2006 Lebanon war, Hizbullah deliberately staged its fight against Israel in a way that damaged Israel in international media coverage."

Participants (N = 334) were contacted from a systematic random sample of 2233 students, and surveyed by telephone in October 2005 (n=122 questions). From a subset of 52 question items, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine hypothesized relationships between the observed measures and four latent constructs: social, media, spatial, and community. A structural equation modeled the relationship among the constructs, predicting that media will have an indirect mediating effect on community ties through social and spatial variables, which will directly affect community ties. Two alternative models were constructed predicting both direct and indirect roles of spatial behavior, for model comparison. These findings provide support for the hypotheses that social interactions lead to community ties, that media use influences social integration, and that media use has a mediating effect on the strength of community ties. However, these data do not support the specific hypothesis that spatial behavior has an influence on community ties. These results have implications for our understanding of community belonging. Theoretical implications about the structural influences of space in community behavior have not been tested empirically. The influence of spatial behavior has practical implications for the development of emerging technologies that combine social networking and location awareness tools. Future research is needed to develop more robust measures of spatial behavior and examine the relationship that spatial behavior plays in community belonging."
2007-1614,The Role of News Coverage in Shaping Public Support for War,War & Peace,,,,Paper,The Role of News Coverage in Shaping Public Support for War,War & Peace,"When politicians and citizens are asked to identify what causes public support for war to change over time, news coverage about the war almost always comes up as a likely suspect. Yet scholarship on this topic has almost completely neglected the role of news coverage in changing levels of public support, despite the widespread assumption that the standard factors used to explain public supportnumbers of casualties, costs and benefits of the conflict, dramatic rally events, and whether American forces appear to be winning or losingare conveyed through news coverage to the mass public. Our study is the first to directly test the impact of news coverage on public support for war across a range of major military conflicts. After controlling for casualties and the passage of time, we find that increases in support for war tend to occur during periods with relatively high levels of prominent news coverage about the war. We also find that the intensity of war coverage tends to have a larger impact on support for war than the evaluative tone of that news coverage. We conclude that the dominant opinion process underlying support for major American wars seems to be neither persuasion nor attitude reinforcement, but rather the tendency for war news to activate supportive social identities."

It has been proposed that, while students generally overestimate the prevalence of alcohol consumption on campus, it is the perceptions of the drinking behavior of their close friends and social circles, and not necessarily that of the entire campus, that influence alcohol consumption. This finding highlights the mediating role identification with groups can play in informing descriptive norms and behavior. This paper similarly finds that the perceived drinking behavior of ones close friends are more strongly associated with ones own drinking behavior. This paper extends the research on social norms and alcohol consumption into the realm of television, finding that, in the absence of a real-world reference group, viewers can parasocially identify with televised reference groups, inferring descriptive norms from the televised groups behavior."

I hypothesize that the effects of antidrug ad exposure on marijuana-use-related cognitions, intentions, and initiation are mediated by beliefs in favorable outcomes of marijuana use. In an effort to educate youth about negative consequences of drug use and ways to say no to drugs, the ads also offered information that illuminated positive consequences of use as well, thus offering counterbenefit information. Thus, an unintended effect of these ads may have been to educate youth and communicate about the benefits of using drugs. Accordingly, this research proposes to account for, in part, the campaigns apparent boomerang effects on youth. 4 nationally representative cohorts of youth were surveyed 3 times an average of 15 months apart. Mediation analysis is used; lagged regression analyses offer limited supportive evidence."
2007-1617,The Role of Television Programming in the Creation of Social Capital: A Construction and Application of the Social Capital Index,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Role of Television Programming in the Creation of Social Capital: A Construction and Application of the Social Capital Index,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Audience fragmentation is intensifying because of the appearance of more specialized or discriminating programs, along with the audience's increased control over television channels. As a result, we lose chances to share the common experience of watching the same program. Since shared experience can promote social interactions between people, less shared experience due to audience fragmentation may weaken social relations or erode the social capital of a society. Moreover, audience fragmentation limits the scope of people with whom one can share an experience to like-mined people with similar preferences, reducing the chance of exposure to programs that represent different voices and opinions. Eventually, particular groups opinions and perspectives are hardly mediated to the public through broadcasting, and thus cannot be reflected in policy decision processes. With this perspective in mind, this study evaluates how much each television program can help create social capital among audiences. In particular, it proposes the Social Capital Index (SCI), measuring each television program's ability forms a network of shared-experience among its viewers, and how this shared experience might eventually contribute to building social capital. Its applicability is then assessed by applying it to 168 programs actually broadcasted in Korea."

It makes sense of the recent growth and diversification of the field by tracing its emergence and evolution as guided by the seemingly archaic term online community as coordinative production frame. Hereby, it demonstrates how the theoretical advances produced by the multi-disciplinary knowledge network of scholars studying mediated organizing and socializing may be better understood in the context of a structurational process between two dominant cognitive research frames. One of them is represented by the community metaphor, and the other one is represented by the network metaphor of electronic communication. By examining how researchers representing many different disciplines and research traditions have been collectively weaving back and forth between paradigmatically foregrounding one metaphor while backgrounding the other one, some light is shed on the coevolutionary dynamics of scholarly knowledge production. It is argued that the recursive engagement with both paradigms, carried out by different clusters of researchers in the network at different points in time, enabled the community of scholars as a whole to process the adaptation of network theory more quickly. Retaining online community as a metaphor is thus viewed as tool for coping with complexity that has been speeding up the advancement of the scholarly community rather than obstructing it."

Comparisons with journalism routines are explored. In-depth, semistructured personal interviews were conducted with bloggers who focus primarily on social and political issues. A number of routines were identified, including specializing content, dodging stories because of lack of time for fact checking, constructing audiences in terms of statistical feedback, developing a niche persona, typifying source material and standardizing the content/commentary form of posting. Likely negative consequences include continued focus on national over local issues, avoiding personal reporting and an emphasis on style over substance."

The following paper, discussing an episode about John Kerry and the 2004 American presidential election, illustrates how a rumor and its subsequent image circulation invite a tabloidesque orientation to the political process. News stories that are not ostensibly about policy initiatives or even leadership abilities are affected by lifestyle type stories that ultimately frame what some will consider to be more substantive issues of policy outlooks, experience and record, and leadership abilities. In fact, this kind of coverage, generically closer to reality TV than to traditional campaign reporting, may serve to drown out or preclude consideration of such ostensibly substantive qualities of the campaign process through powerful techniques of political branding, which ultimately serve dual political and news business purposes."
2007-1623,The Rural Conundrum: Examining E-Rate Implementation in Rural America,Network Neutrality and Broadband Development,,,,Paper,The Rural Conundrum: Examining E-Rate Implementation in Rural America,Network Neutrality and Broadband Development,"The E-Rate program was mandated by the 1996 Telecommunications Act to fund telecommunications and internet access in U.S. schools and libraries, in a manner that the most needy schools and libraries are preferentially funded. However, the complex, multi-stage application process may prevent some school districts from availing of E-Rate funds due to lack of technical expertise and administrative support. Thus, the intent of the act to provide support to the neediest schools is at least partially neutralized by procedural hurdles and resource constraints. The objective of the paper is to assess the cumulative impact of these two contradictory effects. We also examine learning effects and hypothesize that the funding gap between poor/rural school districts has narrowed over time due to experience and better information. Data on all E-Rate funded projects where the recipient is a school district were collected for two years, 1999 and 2004, for the state of Pennsylvania. This data were analyzed using multiple regression and repeated measures ANCOVA. Among other results, we found that rural school districts continue to be disadvantaged compared to their urban peers. The consequences of this for policy-making are discussed in the conclusions."

Canadian producers, through their cultural proximity to the United States as well as their experiences working with American counterparts in the Canadian runaway locations industry, have become particularly adept at integrating the Hollywood style while maintaining a unique cultural sensibility that appeals to the U.S. industrys current discourse on the need for both standard formulas and competitive originality in the post-network era. This paper explores this process through a case study of Canadian producer Chris Haddocks series Da Vincis Inquest, a crime drama that has been sold to thirty countries and was the first Canadian series to be purchased by a major American network (CBS)."

Bush and The New York Times by focusing on North Korea over time. How the two counterparts portrayed attributes of North Korea and how the attributes influenced the publics perceptions about the country were examined. The newspaper strongly influenced the attributes used by President Bush, although the latter also exerted some influence on the former. Attributes highlighted by the two counterparts influenced the publics perceptions of North Korea."
2007-1626,The Second Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,The Public Sphere,,,,Paper,The Second Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,The Public Sphere,"Referring to the ICA 2006 keynote speech, this paper empirically takes a path not taken in social science, marked by John Dewey, C. Wright Mills, Jürgen Habermas, and pragmatist thought more generally. The paper provides a synthetic empirical discussion and a tentative periodization of the structural transformations of this intermediary sphere in Western Europe and in the U.S. While the classical works portrayed the structural transformation of the public sphere as a single process within a framework of decline, this paper points out the distinct second structural transformation--that is, the differentiation of the media from the polity and the de-differentiation from the economy and the decrease of politically pillarized large-scale communities. This second structural transformation of the public sphere profoundly changes the political communication itself."
2007-1627,The Selection Process in Local Court Reporting: A Case Study of Four Dresden Daily Newspapers,The Importance of Localization to Quality in Journalism,,,,Paper,The Selection Process in Local Court Reporting: A Case Study of Four Dresden Daily Newspapers,The Importance of Localization to Quality in Journalism,"Court reporting is a regular feature of German daily newspapers and is widely read by a third of German newspaper readers. However, only a modest number of the daily trials find their way into the press. The aim of the present study is to identify the process and criteria for selecting local court cases for press coverage. The study is based on 4 Dresden daily newspapers whose reporting is examined in a first sub-study by means of content analysis. The results signal a focus on criminal, rather than civil, law matters as well as trials conducted in the place of publication. A second substudy involved observation of the selection of criminal law matters at Dresden county court by reporters of the 4 newspapers. It was possible to identify a multistep selection process as a result of which only a fraction of the trials were reported. Thirdly, selection factors were identified using guided interviews with court reporters and their editors. Significant factors steering selection included the seriousness of the deed, the diversity of reporting, the degree to which the readers are directly affected by the event, the prominence of the participants as well as the possibility for simple presentation and illustration."
2007-1628,The Seven Deadly Sins of Communication Research,Theme Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Seven Deadly Sins of Communication Research,Theme Interactive Paper Session,We analyzed anonymized copies of the complete reviewer comments for 120 recent submissions to the Journal of Communication and attempted to identify which scholarly sins and virtues were most frequently mentioned by the reviewers and which were most closely associated with the recommendation to accept a paper for publication. We assessed levels of interreviewer agreement and patterns of evaluation in different subfields of communications scholarship. An explicit connection to a clearly identified theoretical corpus and novelty in findings and perspectives proved to be the most significant predictors of publication. We discuss the ramifications of these findings for the current state of fragmentation and ferment in communication research.
2007-1629,The Shaping of Korean Popular Music from 1945 to the 1960s,Constructing and Reconstructing the '60s,,,,Paper,The Shaping of Korean Popular Music from 1945 to the 1960s,Constructing and Reconstructing the '60s,"This paper explores the history of South Korean popular music after her liberation from the Japanese colonization. Since the American military entered South Korea in 1945, there has been competitive contestation for cultural hegemony between Japanese-style and American-style music, especially after South Koreas liberation. The American military government introduced cultural policies that favored America in order to intensify the political bond between South Korea and America. This policy enables Korean people assimilate American popular culture. In addition, institutions such as AFKN (American Forces Korean Network) and the Eight US Army Show have provided Korean musicians and audiences with resources for entertainment or the education of new music. American broadcasting and performance have influenced the shaping of modern popular music in South Korea. American-style music, such as rock, standard pop and folk music, has dominated popular music industry in South Korea since the 1960s. My paper examines how American popular music has gained cultural hegemony over Korean audiences through cultural policy analysis and archival works. This study will contribute to the understanding of the relationship between traditional music, Japanese-style music and American-style music since 1945. Historically, popular music has never received academic attention appropriate for its prominence in society. Unlike other studies Park (2003) and Shin (2004) concentrated on a particular genre; however, my study will address general popular music and its social/political context. Furthermore, it will discuss popular musics transformation in terms of Koreas reception of modernity."
2007-1630,The Situational Theory of Publics in a Different Cultural Setting: The Case of Singapore,Developments in Public Relations Theory Building I,,,,Paper,The Situational Theory of Publics in a Different Cultural Setting: The Case of Singapore,Developments in Public Relations Theory Building I,"Many of the theoretical constructs that form the body of knowledge of public relations have originated primarily in the US with some elements of the literature coming from a couple of countries of Western Europe such as the U.K. and Germany. In an ever globalizing world, it behooves us to ask whether, and if so to what extent, these theoretical constructs are also applicable in other parts of the world. Such an analysis would help both the profession and body of knowledge move toward developing global theories of public relations, which should prove very useful to scholars and professionals alike. With that rationale, this study applied the Situational theory of publics (conceptualized and tested over the past 20 years or so in the U.S.) in a non-U.S. environment to assess the communication behaviors of a sample of Singaporeans vis-à-vis the level of customer service in the retail sector of this city-state. The study collected quantitative data consisting of 242 completed surveys of retail customers and qualitative data based on three focus groups of retail consumers. Results revealed that the situational theory was quite useful in identifying the communication behaviors of consumer publics in Singapore showing that the theory is applicable in a different cultural setting. Based on our data, we classified most respondents as ""aware"" publics. A majority of the respondents perceived that there was a lack of good customer service practices in Singapore displaying high levels of problem recognition. However, they displayed constrained behavior in seeking better service as a response to this problem. Only a few survey respondents and focus group participants complained when faced with poor service. Those that complained were not persistent. Cultural factors such as deference to authority and tolerance of fellow human beings appeared to play a role in the constrained behaviors of the respondents. Despite this apparent apathy among consumers, it is recommended that retailers proactively improve their customer service practices and preempt future activism arising from an environment that is becoming more dynamic due to globalization and the entry of competitive multinational retailers to Singapore."
2007-1631,The Social and Personal Dynamics of HIV Stigma,Communication Perspectives on HIV/AIDS for the 21st Century,,,,Paper,The Social and Personal Dynamics of HIV Stigma,Communication Perspectives on HIV/AIDS for the 21st Century,"Scholars across many disciplines have examined and defined HIV stigma, identified its sources, and provided evidence as to how it affects the social, psychological, and physical experiences of those living with HIV. Despite the value of this foundational work, far more research is required to better understand HIV stigmas psychosocial dynamics. In particular, research that explores the intersection of communication and psychosocial outcomes would greatly elucidate how HIV stigma functions in the lives of people infected with the virus. As such, the purpose of this manuscript is to synthesize the extant literature on HIV stigma to provide a review of the sources, forms, and prevalence of HIV stigma within the United States, as well as the documented effects stigma has on people living with HIV, culminating in the presentation of unfulfilled areas of social interaction research still needed to address the challenging and pervasive epidemic of HIV stigma."

We offer a structural model that addresses a discrepancy in previous attitude formation research  whether interpersonal discussion leads to attitude extremity, or extremity leads to discussion. By using data based on a longitudinal, nationwide mail survey carried out between 2002 and 2005, we explore within-wave and between-wave causal paths, revealing patterns difficult to discern in traditional attitude formation experimental designs. Our findings show that it is discussion itself  and not media  that directly influences the formation of extreme attitudes. Furthermore, the type of discussion plays a substantial role in shaping these attitudes, with networks composed of likeminded others leading directly to the development of extreme attitudes toward stem cell research."
2007-1633,"The Sound of Safety: Design, Disguise, and Disclosure in Early Phonography",Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,"The Sound of Safety: Design, Disguise, and Disclosure in Early Phonography",Communication and Technology Interactive Paper Session,"In 1906 the Victor Talking Machine Company produced the Victor-Victrola, the first mass-produced phonograph to feature an internal horn (i.e. speaker). From the outside this machine appeared as a cabinet designed to harmonize with the domestic surroundings, thereby disguising its mechanical interior. Communication technology in general call into question distinctions between private and public, personal and political, as well as the bourgeois individual and the social totality. Particular machines such as the Victrola camouflage the processes by which they connect to the outside world. This paper analyzes Victors marketing material for the Victrola, design elements of the machine, and popular literature of the time to situate the producer, the technology, and its reception. Borrowing from Walter Benjamins critique of the bourgeois interior, this paper argues that the design of the Victrola indicates a way producers and consumers managed threats posed by communication technology to the sanctity of the private sphere around the turn-of-the twentieth century. I suggest that the design innovations of the Victor-Victrola articulates to contemporary trends in technology toward effaced objects that facilitate interactive or smart modes of interfacing with machines embedded in everyday life interiors."

My purpose in doing so is twofold. First, I want to better understand the place and function of the TRC in South Africas transition from apartheid to multiracial democracy. Such an examination clearly illuminates the enormity of what the Commission accomplished by considering its work in light of Habermass work. Secondly, I want to affirm some of Habermass claims about the power of the civil society and its relation to political power and steering by critically assessing these ideas in relation to some of the TRCs major achievements. It is my position that such an examination elucidates a number of important gains of both the truth commissions handiwork and the valuable theoretical articulations in Between Fact and Norms. The TRC cleared space within the public sphere, and established itself as a strong, anchoring institution in the fledgling democracys civil society. It is my contention that as an institution of civil society, the TRC did remarkable work in changing public opinion and thought about the past in the public sphere and began the difficult task of integrating an historically factionalized society. Between Facts and Norms offers an important reminder of the importance of a robust and invigorated civil society, which is vital to a public sphere that truly is deliberative and democratic."
2007-1635,The Spiral of Invisibility: Social control in the S-Korean Blogosphere,Limits to Creating Critical Content Online,,,,Paper,The Spiral of Invisibility: Social control in the S-Korean Blogosphere,Limits to Creating Critical Content Online,"In the exponential growth of weblogs (blogs) around the world, they have been portrayed to be one of the most democratic media in history. This paper sets out to rethink the role of the politics of visibility in shaping the potentially democratic space of blogs. Given an emphasis on the unique socio-cultural context of South Korea, widely known as one of the most technologically advanced and networked societies in the world, this paper explores how collective social pressure imposes new constraints on the interactivity of opinion in the blogosphere. Based on participant observation in multiple blogospheres in Korea, this paper examines how the complexity of self-disclosure through blogging and the gaze of other bloggers affect the interactivity of opinion. It concludes that a democratic technology of blogs alone does not seem to provide an ideal democratic space, but rather a newly contested space as a result of online social control in Korea."
2007-1636,The Stand-Alone See?: Claiming Evidential Vindication in Conversation,"Little Words, Big Results: How Single Words Accomplish Action in Conversation",,,,Paper,The Stand-Alone See?: Claiming Evidential Vindication in Conversation,"Little Words, Big Results: How Single Words Accomplish Action in Conversation","One intersection of social action and linguistic form can be seen in the use of See? as a stand-alone lexical item in conversation. Speakers use See? to claim a prior turn (or event in the physical environment) as evidential support for a previously disputed assertion, that is, to claim evidential vindication. The prior turn or event, which See? retrospectively targets need not have been produced by its speaker and in its local context as a form of evidential support. This can be seen in the following extract that comes from a sub-collection of stand-alone See? tokens taken from a larger collection of more than 70 instances of the particle see in conversation. Prior to this extract, Virginia has attempted to convince her mother that her allowance should be increased. One reason for the increase which Virginia provides (and which the mother challenges) is that the extra money is needed to buy gas for the car. After roughly five minutes without further mention of her allowance, Virginia requests permission to use the car (lines 1-3).

1 VIR: MOM after dinner c'n um (.) .hh Beth an I g'over ma- um
2 (0.4) sih- um (0.3) (y'know)- jus ridin aroun fer a little
3 whi:le

5 MOM: Put ga:s in thuh ca:hr.
6 (0.3)
7 VIR: (y')SEE:?
8 MOM: O:H [youre ri:ght] youre ri:ght.

Although the mothers turn was produced, in its sequential context, as a contingent approval of Virginias request, the stand-alone See? does not treat the mothers turn as such, but rather claims it as evidential support for Virginias previous assertion (i.e., that an increase in her allowance is needed to pay for gas). The mothers subsequent response conveys both a change in stance toward and agreement with the disputed assertion and thus reveals her analysis of the See?-targeted turn as support for the previous assertion.

An analysis of the stand-alone See? not only reveals how individual words may be used in the formulation of social action, but also how speakers may recontextualize or adapt a prior speakers talk to reveal its import for a sequence or course of action other than that for which the talk had been produced. This research thus contributes to recent conversation analytic work on retrospectivity in conversation (Schegloff 2005, 2006)."

A scheme indicating different types of current Chinese newspapers operating in the Party-state and market spheres was constructed. A comparative study of the Peoples Daily, the flagship mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Beijing Youth Daily, one of the most influential mass-appeal newspapers in China, was conducted. Differences existed in issue salience and use of different types of news frames. The Beijing Youth Daily with more financial autonomy presented its inclination to marginalize politically sensitive issues and its greater likelihood of using the human interest frame than the Peoples Daily which, with higher political privileges, was more likely to frame those issues from the perspectives of responsibility and morality. The comparison suggests that we might need to be conservative to draw an inference that the Chinese media would enjoy more political liberality with its increased diversified structure."
2007-1638,The State of Media Control in Malaysia,tate & Systems,,,,Paper,The State of Media Control in Malaysia,State & Systems,"Media control in Malaysia is almost as old as the existence of mass media in the country. Malaysia falls under the category of democracy variously called quasi-democracy, authoritarian-democracy, or Asian democracy. The government is firmly controlled by the ruling coalition, Barisan National (National Front), for half a century. The ruling party has over the years created and reinforced numerous mechanisms to ensure an obedient media that will not jeopardize the status quo. This paper is an examination of the various implementations the Government has utilized to retain that control. Among the most oppressing legislations of the media includes The Sedition Act, The Printing Presses and Publication Act, The Multimedia and Communication Act, and The Internal Security Act. An understanding of the legislations is important for any investigation of the medias sociopolitical structure."

I will discuss the general orientations and assumptions that guide many of the inquiries that guide studies on online girls, as well as highlight those areas that merit further attention or whose examination warrant greater methodological diversity. I will also offer comments about the relative dearth of studies examining boys Internet use, and how this paucity contributes to how we interpret and frame girls online experiences. The presentation aims to inspire dialogue about how studies on girls Internet use could be expanded to provide more contextualized and consequential research.

Susannah Stern is Assistant Professor of Communication Studies at the University of San Diego. She has studied girls media use, especially their Internet use, for the past 10 years. She has published numerous articles and book chapters on the subject, and has spoken both domestically and internationally at conferences on the topic as well. Dr. Stern has also taught undergraduate courses on gender, youth, and media. She is frequently asked to consult on government-funded projects regarding girls Internet use, and is commonly interviewed by the press as an expert in the field of youth Internet use."

The analysis constitutes a comprehensive sample of 699 researched articles covering the topic of conflict in health disciplines over the past 3 and a half decades. Each article was coded for journal, year of publication, authorship, affiliations, theoretical framework, interdisciplinary perspectives, definitions of conflict, type of conflict, constructs, outcomes, research designs, sample size and future research direction. By way of conclusion, conflict management may be one of many areas of engagement for scholars interested in both public health and public communication, and this study seeks to comprehensively assess the development of the concepts and interaction of conflict research in public health literature and suggests further research directions in the emerging areas of health conflict research."

Based on a recently developed research framework in the area of user acceptance of technology, this study identifies 5 key determinants, i.e., performance expectancy, recreation expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, to explain peoples blogging behavior. Data were collected through a large-scale online survey in July 2005 in China, resulted in a sample of bloggers with 6363 valid cases. The findings of this study show that social influence and performance expectancy are the 2 most important determinants which positively affect the length of a bloggers daily blogging time. As socially and instrumentally used blogs seems to be the most sticky or sustainable blogs, it is clear that blogging is increasingly incorporated into bloggers everyday lives."

Media ratings data showed that the campaign reached 86% of Egyptian adultsapproximately 34 million peoplewithin the first 24 hours. Egypt was able to respond swiftly and effectively due to strong partnership and coordination between the health and information ministries and the availability of a national AI communication strategy developed with the help of the Communication for Healthy Living project. In a national impact evaluation survey (n=4052) conducted three months after the campaign launch, 70 percent of adults (roughly 28 million people) reported initiating at least one protective behavior (e.g., changes in handwashing or cooking practices) as result of seeing the campaign messages. Consistent with the Extended Parallel Processing Model, changes in behavior were associated with changes in perceived threat and perceived efficacy."

Internet service providers can connect to the SuperNet to provide high speed access to rural areas where it was previously unavailable. While the network holds promise for future opportunities and construction is complete, the SuperNets implementation is fraught with difficulties. Research in rural areas uncovers three central obstacles: deficient communication from the government about the network and its potential; a pricing structure that is cost prohibitive to small organizations; and ISPs lack of interest in serving rural areas. These major barriers have left SuperNet equipment sitting idle, rural community members unsure of what the network can do, and some counties creating municipally-owned ISPs to bypass private providers. This paper examines the challenges faced by rural Albertans in connecting to the SuperNet."

Analyses have found frequent sexual but little sexual health content in the media teens use, different patterns of exposure to this content based on sexual self concepts, and a longitudinal relationship between exposure to sexual content and earlier sexual intercourse. An overview of the findings and implications for further research as well as sexual health policies will be discussed."
2007-1647,The Telenovela Dura: The Brazilianization of a Genre,Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,The Telenovela Dura: The Brazilianization of a Genre,Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,"There have been no shortage of accounts of the genesis of Latin American telenovelas. To be more precise, however, I should say that these accounts correspond to the first great tradition of telenovela-making. The novelas made within this tradition, which I will call blanda, tend to follow a predictable narrative pattern consisting mainly of a romantic situation where the central couple's love runs into a series of obstacles such as third persons (usually villains beyond redemption), class differences, and/or secrets and lies regarding the origins of one or both members of the couple. But perhaps the most crucial characteristic of the telenovela blanda, and the one of greatest relevance for this study, is that it neutralizes any referential system that might effectively connect characters and plot to the familiar aspects of lived experience that people encounter everyday. The result is a narrative that, while ostensibly taking place in a particular country (because we are told so now and then), does not correspond to any specific national reality and, furthermore, seems to float above the immediacy of everyday life. While a good understanding of the genesis of the telenovela blanda has a great deal of importance for the analysis of this quintessential Latin American cultural product, so does a proper account of the development of the second major tradition of telenovela production, which began in Brazil. This paper seeks to trace the historical development of this other great tradition of telenovela-making, which I am designating with the term telenovela dura."

Hizballah began the trend in pro-Arab video games when it released Special Force in 2003. Based on the resistance against Israeli occupation in Southern Lebanon during the 1980s, the game became an instant hit. Following suit, a Syrian-based gaming company released 2 other games Under Ash and Under Siege, simulated around the events of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. These videogames have created political combat zones on multiple levels. The games share common political themes in their deliberately political and overtly pro-Arabness. The creators of the games claim that they are seeking to correct the influence of western gaming concepts on the Middle East, and combat the view that the oppressor always defeats the Arab. Critics of the games claim that these are nothing short of propaganda enticing kids to join Islamic resistance groups, and part of the larger battle over childrens minds. Based on content analysis of video games, and interviews with game users and creators, this paper looks at the controversies surrounding these games, and analyzes the growing trend in religious media, the use of media to politically engage children, and the significance of the appropriation of Western technologies by Islamic groups. The paper also challenges essentialist and reductionist explanations of the role of Islam in Arab societies, and the ethno-centrism of scholars analyses of the technical illusion (Virilio) and hyperrealist logic (Baudrillard) of war in the digital age."

As one of the most significant film-producing/consuming countries, Korea is one of only a few countries where Hollywood films lose an edge to domestic films. At the same time, Korea is a leading country in communication technologies, including internet and mobile phone. Therefore, it will be very interesting and valuable to closely look at the change in film-viewing practices of Koreans youngsters..
In Korea, we can observe that the mode of reception of film is more and more multiplicated with the rapid diffusion of new technologies such as home theater, digital TV, PMP, mobile phone or the internet. In this context, this paper attempts to investigate differences and significations which are generated in film viewer's experiences, by uses of new screen technologies. For the purpose, we will focus on film-viewing practices of young Koreans in their twenties."
2007-1651,The Treatment of Fallacies in Argumentation Situations During Mediation Sessions,Creating Opposition and Pursuing its Possibilities,,,,Paper,The Treatment of Fallacies in Argumentation Situations During Mediation Sessions,Creating Opposition and Pursuing its Possibilities,"The study examines how participants of mediation sessions treat fallacies in naturally occurring argumentation discussions. Two types of fallacies that occur in the process of these interactions are distinguished: traditional (e.g., ad fallacies, begging the question, a fallacy of hasty generalization) and untraditional (i.e., wrong moves that does not belong to the traditional list of fallacies but, nevertheless, were treated as such by recipients themselves). The results show that whether an argumentation move is considered to be fallacious or nonfallacious depends on the orientation of participants themselves to this interaction phenomenon and on the context it is used in. Also, arguments that are traditionally recognized as fallacies are not always treated as such by arguers in ordinary conversations, whereas moves that do not fit in this category are viewed as wrong ones."

Black internationalism is explored in the context of 19th Century Carribbean politics and events. Communications between Haiti and Louisiana during the Age of Revolution is suggested as a location of importance.
2007-1653,The Uncanny Impulse of Locative Media,Theorizing Network Cultures,,,,Paper,The Uncanny Impulse of Locative Media,Theorizing Network Cultures,"This essay considers recent artistic appropriations of mobile GPS devices in terms of their potential for producing new modes of representation of the virtual spaces of multinational capitalism. In particular, it examines the conditions of possibility for an oppositional politics articulated through these devices with respect to their relationship to the operationalized gaze of a massive military-industrial apparatus. These appropriations, called Locative Media, are part of a wider trend to politicize virtual spaces by reasserting the primacy and insolubility of the material world through the tropes of geography and mapping. The essay investigates two projects: first, it examines MILK, by artists Esther Polak and Ieva Auzina of the Riga Center for New Media Culture (RIXC), which uses GPS to track the route of milk from the udder of the cow to the plate of the consumer, and second, the art collective Blast Theorys Uncle Roy All Around You, a game in which players collaboratively track the game character Uncle Roy simultaneously in both a virtual city using a web application and on foot in an actual city. Both of these projects foreground the assumption that the construction of alternative spaces is complicated by the technological devices involved, especially when the devices are the materially manifest objectives of control society. The essay concludes that Locative Media projects often avoid reproducing a military aesthetic by drawing ambiguous, incomplete maps that call attention to the inherent potentials for resistance, the blind spots, inside the gaze of operational media."

Universities were counterbalanced by geographic region and diversity of population. Changes from pretest to posttest on the key dependent measures including signing a donor card and discussing donation with family members, were significantly greater in the media-plus-interpersonal condition than either the mass media only or control conditions. Implications for the creation of campaigns to promote other health behaviors are examined."
2007-1655,The Use of Culturally Specific Rhetoric in a Health Video for Lumbee Indians,Race and Ethnicity in Risk Situations,,,,Work in Progress,The Use of Culturally Specific Rhetoric in a Health Video for Lumbee Indians,Race and Ethnicity in Risk Situations,"This paper presents preliminary findings from focus groups responding to a video designed for Lumbee women in the Carolinas. Reflections on Survival was produced as a tool for the American Indian Lay Health Advisor Project, to communicate the risk of breast and cervical cancer and to persuade the target audience to adopt a regimen of cancer screenings. Produced by Native American Interfaith Ministries, the video is used by churches and other faith-based organizations in southeastern North Carolina and has aired repeatedly on cable television in Robeson County since 2003. The ability of specific audiovisual elements and local verbal content to hail the target audience, persuade them, and inspire them had never been evaluated formally. This paper discusses Lumber River imagery, local accents, Lumbee family names, local history, medical elders, and American Cancer Society recommendations as ethos, logos, and mythos in the videos main arguments and reports their potential to have their intended effects."
2007-1656,The Use of Equivocation in the Opinion Discourse of Political Talk: A Comparison of Political and News Interviews,Language & Social Interaction Interactive Poster Session,,,,Paper,The Use of Equivocation in the Opinion Discourse of Political Talk: A Comparison of Political and News Interviews,Language & Social Interaction Interactive Poster Session,"Political talk shows have become a popular format to both debate the issues of the week and, additionally, hear the opinions of both politicians and journalists. Recently, these political and news interviews have garnered research attention (see, for example, Bull & Mayor, 1993; Bull, 1998; Beattie, 1982, Gnisci & Bonaiuto, 2003), often on the basis of analyzing the questions asked and answers given. Due to both the prevalence of these shows, as well as their impact on public opinion, it is important to study both opinion discourse in the context of political talk shows, as well as the form and functions of the questions and answers contained therein. This study examines the potential differences in equivocal communication during a political interview (where the interviewee is a politician) and a news interview (where the interviewee is a fellow journalist). The questions asked in the interview were coded based on whether or not the question placed the interviewee in an avoidance-avoidance situation, while the coding system of answers was based on whether or not the clarity of the response deviated from one of the four communicative dimensions of Content, Receiver, Context, and Sender. Significant differences in interview type were found when looking at the Content and Sender dimension."

It analyzes the United States and Europe on freedom of expression on the assumption that the American approach [to freedom of speech], as compared with that which prevails elsewhere, is largely a function of experience, and of the increasing array of cases and challenges that come from time.
The substantive case analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court on the First Amendment and of the ECHR on Article 10 is the main focus of this paper. Critical attention is paid to those key free speech areas such as prior restraint, defamation, obscenity, and commercial speech: a large body of case law in these areas has been accumulated, and a significant trend can be more easily discerned for comparison."
2007-1658,"The Vanishing Subject of Democracy: Autonomy, Authenticity and Publicly Mediated Self-presentation in Democratic Discourse",Parrhesia in the Public: The Ethics and Practice of Truth-Telling in Mass Media,,,,Paper,"The Vanishing Subject of Democracy: Autonomy, Authenticity and Publicly Mediated Self-presentation in Democratic Discourse",Parrhesia in the Public: The Ethics and Practice of Truth-Telling in Mass Media,"Both theoretically and institutionally, democracy is built on the assumption of a rational, autonomous (as well as informed and sincere) subject citizen. However, the plausibility of such a postulate can be questioned from any number of quarters. This paper explores several cases of mass media representations (including political blogs with disguised authorship and ambiguities of intent in political ads) where the assumption of sincere, and transparent expressions grounded in stable authorial voice and aimed at validity and truth is undercut in various ways. At the same time, it will argue that norms of sincerity and what Foucault interrogates as ""parrhesia"" must nevertheless operate in order for outcomes in the political sphere to pretend any grounds of legitimacy. In this light, the paper investigates what might be salvaged of the normative structure of democratic discourse given the seeming impossibility of either conceptualizing or determining the presence of stable subjects of the sort assumed in the architecture of democratic theory."
2007-1659,The Visual Representation of the Female in Turkish Press,Visual Studies Interactive Paper Session,,,,ractive Paper (Poster),The Visual Representation of the Female in Turkish Press,Visual Studies Interactive Paper Session,"This study analyses the female visuals in six Turkish newspapers representing different sociopolitical positions. The study argues that the exclusion of visuals from earlier analyses creates a pitfall and aims to expand the previous research with the incorporation of visual analysis. Secondly, as is the case in previous research, approaching secular and religious press as two separate camps tends to obscure the similarities between religious and secular newspapers and the differences within secular and within religious newspapers with respect to the depiction of women. Therefore this study aims not only to look at the differences between secular and religious newspapers in Turkey but also to the differences within them in terms of the visual representation of women. Methodologically iconographical analysis of Erwin Panofsky is employed to analyze the characteristics and meanings of the visuals. In theoretical terms theories of modernity and gender in relation to Muslim contexts inform the study."
2007-1660,The Voice of the National Press on European Integration: A Comparative Analysis of Agenda-Setting and Framing in Western Europe,Agenda Setting & Framing,,,,Paper,The Voice of the National Press on European Integration: A Comparative Analysis of Agenda-Setting and Framing in Western Europe,Agenda Setting & Framing,"In this paper we seek to understand how national political contexts and different media formats influence the role of the press in building up a European public sphere. For this purpose we systematically compare commentaries of different newspaper types in seven Western European countries for the years 2000 to 2002 regarding their agenda-setting and framing of the European integration project. The results show that the further a country is integrated into the European Union, the less parochial its press and the stronger it takes part in a common European debate. Compared to these political settings the influence of specific media formats seems to play a secondary role."
2007-1661,The Watchdogs Bite: Viewer Reactions to Uncivil News Interviews,Top 4 Student Papers in Mass Communication,,,,Paper,The Watchdogs Bite: Viewer Reactions to Uncivil News Interviews,Top 4 Student Papers in Mass Communication,"As the media environment becomes saturated with aggressive interview programs, this experimental study explores the relationship between confrontational television interviews and the decline in public trust and support for journalism. At the core of this papers research questions, stands the tension between the institutional standards of journalism and the conversational norms of society. Interviewers justify their aggressive questioning as being a necessary manifestation of their watchdog function. If their questions seem rude or invasive, they are doing so on behalf of the public with the intent of keeping politicians in check. However, a sizeable body or research suggests that news consumers are not as committed to the watchdog function as are their news providers. Absent public support for this role, confrontational interviewing may seem unnecessarily aggressive, uncivil and negative. Consistent with the literature on televised incivility and its effects, the study tests the proposition that exposure to interviewers that violate the acceptable norms of conversation will lead viewers to develop more negative attitudes toward the press. The findings lend conditional support to this hypothesis. Viewers exposed to uncivil interviews indeed tended to express less confidence in journalists professionalism and less of a personal affinity to journalists compared with those exposed to civil interviews. The effect was conditioned by the subjects political ideology. With the exception of self-declared strong liberals, these effects were prononunced and statistically significant. Furthermore, the change in attitudes affected support for journalistic practices, namely, the reliance on anonymous sourcing. Limitations and implications are discussed in the paper."
2007-1662,The Word and the World: Rethinking International Communication,Discourses of International and Development Communication,,,,Paper,The Word and the World: Rethinking International Communication,Discourses of International and Development Communication,"This essay is a summative theoretical/epistemic gesture aimed at rethinking of the field of International Communication. It is a critical engagement with theories of the past but it is primarily an attempt at imaginationblending the literature and ideas from a wide range of fields but more crucially centering communication at the international level. The paper offers a theoretical construct called the IC prism which allows for engagement with the logics of globalization (modernism, post-modernism, nationalism, capitalism, terrorism and post-colonialism) and various media forms (television, radio, cell phones, internet, film)."

The paper will suggest that reality TV, on the one hand, allows, in cases such as Big Brother, the acting out in ritualised play of many of the skills required in the flexible work economy: passion, emotional commitment, individual adaptability, the combination of team conformity and personal ambition. On the other hand, programmes such as The Apprentice portray in more directly ideological fashion new norms of performance and command for the neo-liberal economy of high risk and corporate insecurity. In these two contrasting ways, both direct and less direct, transparent and opaque, reality TV acts as a secret theatre of the neo-liberal workplace."

It nevertheless occupies a critical function in periods in which external factors such as regulation, technological development, or changing market formations force adjustments in dominant practices, because industry lore can be vital in determining the imagined range of new norms. My paper examines the role of industry lore in negotiating new institutional processes as the US television industry radically adapted long entrenched practices of production and textual creation in response to new technologies, patterns of use, and distribution capabilities at the beginning of the 21st century. Attempting to control and assert the new dominant industry lore was a critical task of those hoping to dominate this new era of television. My paper presents examples of the assertion and contestation of industry lore that produced material consequences for the operation of industry and its textual products."

Studies of particular creative professions within the industry regularly only tell halfor rather the middleof the story. For example, Broadcasting and Cable recently reported on a WGA, west announcement that stated that only 27% of employed television writers in 2004 were female. What I will offer in my presentation is a critical reappraisal of this data, an economic production studies analysis that shows how certain areas of production are in fact majority female. Yet it is precisely these crafts with the greatest majority of women that are the lowest paid among the key crew members in a film or television production. And the reverse is true as well: the highest paid below-the-line crafts have the lowest ratio of female members. In other words, the hourly rate for department heads of each of the major crafts positions is almost directly proportional to the ratio of men to women in each local guild. Directors of photography (3 percent female) make $57.66 per hour, editors (24 percent female) make $38.92 per hour, art directors (19 percent female) make $38.16 per hour, costume supervisors (73 percent female) make $29.36 per hour, and costume designers (83 percent female) make $27.30 per hour. What this paper will offer is both a more nuanced assessment and analysis of the conditions and economics of gendered production labor."

Using 2 surveys with statewide random samples and content analyses for each, it found that the agenda of issues important to young adults was correlated with the medias issue of agenda at .80 and .90. For the heaviest internet users, who were more likely to be in the 2 youngest age groups, their issue agenda was correlated with the medias at .70. Although the youngest generation used traditional media such as newspapers and television significantly less than older generations, and used the internet significantly more, this differential media use did not eliminate the agenda-setting influence."

This study draws on the spiral of silence theory to investigate whether the public opinion climate impacts young voters willingness to engage in public political discussions. The study found that young citizens willingness to express their political opinions publicly is influenced by their level of political cynicism and information efficacy more than it is influenced by their awareness of the majority public opinion.

More specifically, this research aims to explain the impact of on-line activity, on-line security knowledge, and problem experience on home Internet users attitude toward problems caused by unwanted software programs and their on-line behavior change. As an exploratory approach, this study will first create a conceptual model including these constructs by drawing from theoretical perspectives as well as empirical evidence. Then, the researcher will operationalize the model by drawing observed measures from a survey of a nationally representative sample of home Internet users. After that, through model modifications, the researcher will present the final analytic model based on the analysis of the survey dataset. Finally, the implications and limitations of the model will be discussed."

The Third-Person Effect was examined in terms of its relationship with 2 types of behavioral intentions (donation intention and support for donation PSA). The findings support the behavioral component of Third-Person Effect; there was a significant negative relationship between Third-Person perceptions and behavioral intentions (ß= -.23, p<.001). That is, people who estimated greater influence on others than on themselves tended to have fewer behavioral intentions. The study also explored factors that influence behavioral intentions directly and indirectly through Third-Person perceptions."

In line with findings from previous media effects research, it was hypothesized that participants exposed to helpful celebrities would be more helpful on a subsequent task than participants exposed to unhelpful celebrities. A between-subjects experiment tested if general mental elaboration on these celebrities influenced the willingness of participants to be helpful on a subsequent task. Results indicate that participants helped significantly less after thinking about helpful celebrities than after thinking about unhelpful celebrities, suggesting a contrast effect. General implications of these findings for research in media processes and effects as well as communication campaign development are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided."

Using data from a survey of 1,107 college students in Taiwan about the coverage of avian flu, findings show that respondents tend to think the influence of avian flu news on others was greater than on themselves. Further, exposure to avian flu news was found to narrow the self-other perceptual gap. Regarding behavioral responses to the third-person perception, the study showed that the perceived effects of avian flu news on self prompted people to look for information about avian flu and to seek the antiviral drug Tamiflu. However, the third-person perception also acted as a brake on action."
2007-1672,Third-Person Perception and Purchase Behavior in Response to Various Selling Methods,New Insights Into Advertising Techniques,,,,Paper,Third-Person Perception and Purchase Behavior in Response to Various Selling Methods,New Insights Into Advertising Techniques,"Two studies attempted to investigate whether various tactics of personal selling that generate different levels of resistance also produce different degrees of TPPs. Furthermore, the studies compared third-person perceptions to the actual influence on behavior. Study 1 showed that more direct and blatant selling methods produce more TPP. Study 2 showed that people tend to underestimate the influence of the more direct method, especially with regard to themselves. The study concludes by identifying the ideal selling method as one in which the customers are asked about their willingness to listen to the sales campaign before they are told about it. This method increases sales and creates satisfied customers."
2007-1673,Third-Person Perceptions in the Agenda-Setting Process: Towards an Integration of Two Key Concepts,Agenda Setting,,,,Paper,Third-Person Perceptions in the Agenda-Setting Process: Towards an Integration of Two Key Concepts,Agenda Setting,"One of the most challenging tasks in the current theoretical discussion of media effects refers to the integration of formerly isolated theoretical concepts. While agenda setting has already been linked to priming and framing via the concept of second level agenda setting, the task of the following paper is a closer inspection of third person perceptions (TPP) within the agenda setting process. We argue that part of the agenda-setting function of the mass media is to inform recipients what others believe to be important. This provides the conceptual link between the two concepts. Along these lines of thought, a theoretical model of agenda-setting effects is outlined in which perceptual components play an important role in the conceived process of media influence."
2007-1674,Those Were the Days...of the Dead: Commodification and Mass Mediation of a Death Ritual,"Popular Communication, Ethnicity, and Cultural Memory",,,,Paper,Those Were the Days...of the Dead: Commodification and Mass Mediation of a Death Ritual,"Popular Communication, Ethnicity, and Cultural Memory","Publicly advertised Day of the Dead exhibits and events in the US began in 1972 when Chicano artists in California, inspired by Mexican celebrations, re-created the rituals in the barrios of San Francisco and East L.A. From their onset, these invented traditions were political in nature - primarily meant to communicate about Latino identity and politics rather than to fulfill moral obligations to the deceased. Altars frequently commemorate Latino cultural and political icons (i.e. Frida Kahlo; Che Guevara; Celia Cruz; Cesar Chavez), creating an important public sphere for the transmission of narratives of cultural affirmation, solidarity and political struggle. Over time, aspects of Day of the Dead have become commercialized, from festivals sponsored by Citibank, to the sale of do-it-yourself altar kits in a box (available on Amazon.com), to displays of Day of the Dead products at Starbucks.

There is a tendency among Day of the Dead aficionados to categorize US celebrations as less authentic and more commercial than Mexican celebrations, a critique blatantly expressed by a group of Chicano artists who created the 1998-2000 McMuertos exhibits in San Francisco. Seeking to complicate rigid dichotomies between commercial and authentic expression, this paper discusses the history and impact of commercialization on the celebration, both in Mexico and the US. It suggests that, rather than dilute the tradition, the commodification of Day of the Dead has played an essential role in sustaining and popularizing the custom, ultimately enlarging public spaces for dissenting political expression through art and ritual."

Experiment 1 investigated whether CSP occurs in the absence of people knowing that others possess negative information about them. Results indicated that the expectation and inference of evaluation increased CSP; however, these efforts were constrained to dimensions unrelated to the expected evaluation. Experiment 2 examined whether upward comparisons increase CSP and if such efforts are constrained to areas unrelated to the initial comparison. Results suggest that heightened threat associated with upward comparisons amplified peoples desire to offset unfavorable feedback. Thus, their CSP included areas both related and unrelated to the original evaluative domain. Self-esteem partially mediated the relationship between upward comparisons and CSP."

WWII games cooperate, in their own way, in the maintenance of our collective memory. Nevertheless, in these games historical facts are not considered as important as excitement, heroes, villains (the dichotomy good/evil), and gothic surroundings. Thus, although claiming historical settings and narratives, they are rather reshaping WWII as a stereotypical event with more connections to popular films than to history in it self."

Thus, it was predicted that when regulatory resources were depleted because of recent acts of self-regulation peoples capacity to monitor for relational cues would be negatively impacted. In accord with the hypothesis, the data showed that insofar as the selfs resources were depleted by recent acts of self-regulation, people were less effective at monitoring for relational value cues. These findings provide evidence that suggests an integrative relationship between the selfs regulatory resources and peoples capacity to accurately monitor the social environment for cues that indicate their relational value to others."

Conceptually, we show that any question related to the mode of existence of an organization implies how an organizational form is made present (''presentified''). We argue that it is through ''incarnation'' that such presentification occurs, a term we develop to critique the trap of reification. Empirically, we provide several illustrations of the way members and partners of a humanitarian organization, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, a.k.a. ''Doctors Without Borders''), make this organization present in a Northeastern region of The Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our argument."

Two photographic forms: print and television, have traditionally operated in separate professional spheres. Now convergent internet technology is compelling newspaper organizations to demand that their photographers learn to shoot and edit video. The work of these new broadband journalists is appearing on the web as everything from musical slideshows to highly produced, narrated video stories. Using ethnographic field visits, interviews, and discourse from trade organizations, this paper examines print, television, and broadband photojournalistic practice and the revolutionary changes underway in visual newswork."

In describing the analytic pitfalls that plague ""thick"" descriptions of already prescribed texts of various kinds, Riles warns that if we as researchers are not careful, we may simply replicate or repeat reflexive ""doubles"" of Network-generated propaganda. In examining the space where journalistic, artistic, and activist enterprises merge with anthropological scholarship, I choose to look at a set of media products and events created and staged by a self-described Network of Black quare artists, activists and non-profit professionals and the kinds of patterns that emerge among these local and national media producers and media relations experts. I am interested in deploying a series of paid advertisements that ran in the Baltimore Afro-American in 2004 to help explain a discourse and performance of Black quare self-rejection initiated and restaged in media, day-to-day conversations and on the theatrical stage. In studying a subject that is ""so close,"" both in terms of embodiment and professional history, I envision this paper as an exercise in a rigorous reflexivity that seeks to take Riles' theory one step farther by turning not just the Network but the researcher inside-out."

It will employ symbolic convergence theory and its accompanying fantasy theme analysis in the study of the text and photographs of the catalog and website, depicting the rhetorical vision of a strand of third wave feminism. The catalog was named after the 1972 federal legislation intended to give males and females equal access to sports."
2007-1682,Too Much Information?: Gatekeeping and Information Dissemination in a Networked World,Networking the Poor for Development: Four Global Case Studies,,,,Paper,Too Much Information?: Gatekeeping and Information Dissemination in a Networked World,Networking the Poor for Development: Four Global Case Studies,"Greater connectivity and the dissemination of new communication technologies offer great hope for development. However, as previous research has illustrated a linear relationship between ICT provision and development goals cannot necessarily be assumed. The proliferation of ICTs and exponential increases in information sources available via the World Wide Web has engendered a corresponding rise in the availability of conflicting and sometimes outright misinformation. This paper examines the problems of information overload and the challenges of gatekeeping and information dissemination through a survey of health organization and networking websites dedicated to combating HIV and/or Aids in Southern Africa. It argues that inquiry into the potential and actual roles of ICTs in development is incomplete without consideration of how these technologies both facilitate and complicate the collection, filtration, and dissemination of information relevant to development goals."

The study examines data resulting from journal entries and interviews of women in a large city and a remote, rural area of India, and discusses the findings of this study in the context of the differences between the West, the colonial world, and the East, the colonized world. The study focuses on mother-daughter conversations about such topics as early marriage, separation of the male and female spheres, and womens health. The presentation approaches the issues and problems of communication between mothers and preadolescent daughters in connection with the tensions between traditionalism and modernization, between the cast system and the liberal trends in society, and the appeals of the Indian and the Western media."

South Africa is a unique country in that despite the fact that it is the most developed country in Africa, it gained freedom from apartheid barely 15 years ago. With 11 official languages, and several ethnic and racial groups, South Africa, is just learning to acknowledge itself as a multicultural-democratic country. Presently South Africa is gripped with the AIDS epidemic. The study examines the role that culture and race play in the relationships between mothers and their pre-adolescent daughters, especially with regards to conversation about AIDS. The study also focuses on how much South Africas small yet vibrant media and film industries play into mother-daughter conversations of issues of sex and race."

The study examines the roles played by culture in the relationships between mothers and their pre-adolescent daughters, taking into account several factors such as race, ethnicity, education, family background, social environment and types of media followed. The study critically analyzes the degrees of closeness and of intensity in these mother-daughter relationships, as well as the factors that have the potential to foster or to block mother-daughter communication in the United States, at the beginning of the 21st century, in the context of globalization and consumerism trends."

Women's Identities,,,,Paper,To Remake Penelope's Story: Women and Reproduction of Migration,Solitude or Solidarity? Women's Identities,"An examination of migration in a representative community of Jalisco, Mexico from a cultural perspective as expressed by the women related to these emigrants. The main goal of this study of the habitus and symbolic forms of these communities is to understand how they are transmitted, received and reproduced fomenting further migration and how these women mediate in the reproduction of this phenomenon. A semistructured interview format was chosen as the basic form of dialogue with the women. Women related to the emigrants, spouses, mothers, sisters and daughters, were interviewed. Upon completion of the interviews with the first group of women, the categories of analysis were established and an initial relationship to theory was identified: A description of the reproductive role women are carrying out with respect to migration in their communities."

Although there is a growing use of emoticons, very little research has been conducted on emoticons effects on relational outcomes in CMC. This study examines the effects of smiley emoticons on various relational outcomes, including, liking, metaperceived liking, immediacy/affection, similarity/depth, and uncertainty reduction. This study also tests the effects of emotions on the perceived credibility of the sender and the message. The results indicate that, in many cases, emoticons have a significant effect on developing favorable relational outcomes. It also examines the impact of emoticons on two different types of settings (task-oriented vs. socio-emotional contexts) to see whether there is an interaction effect. Specific results can be found in the discussion."

This paper offers an alternate communication-based conceptualization and operationalization of organizational identification called Communicative Organizational Identification (C-OI). C-OI embodies a type of behavioral identification and is ultimately defined as the manifestation of solidarity with the values of a collective expressed to internal and external others. This new measure was validated through three rounds of data collection from diverse working adults, and resulted in a 9-item measure with 2 valid subscales that compare favorably to existing measure of organizational identification."
2007-1690,Toward a Communication-Based Perspective on Shared Medical Decision Making,hared Decision-Making and Positive Relationships,,,,Paper,Toward a Communication-Based Perspective on Shared Medical Decision Making,Shared Decision-Making and Positive Relationships,"Shared decision making has been advanced as a means of improving quality of care and fulfilling the mandate to change the delivery of healthcare from a paternalistic to more a collaborative practice. However, there are significant impediments to implementing shared decision making initiatives, including equivocal data about its benefits and resistance on the part of patients and providers alike. It is suggested that a communication-based perspective can lead to a richer of understanding of shared decision making, assist practitioners and researchers in overcoming the limits of the one-way, message-based, approach that predominates much of the current literature, and pose a viable alternative to the practice of making treatment decisions without incorporating the experience of patients. The paper presents and discusses three characteristics of an interpersonal perspective: 1) It brings the knowledge and expertise of the provider together with the goals and experience of the patient. 2) It appreciates the crucial role that uncertainty plays medical decision making. 3) It focuses attention on the evolving relationship between patient and provider. The paper concludes by discussing current efforts to utilize this perspective to examine how shared decision making can impact quality of care."

This article seeks to contribute to the project searching of an alternative normative theory of the media by proposing a new modeling with a criterion of diverse notions of a public sphere. Rather than sticking to Habermasian notion of the public sphere, this article chooses to regard the conception of the public sphere as metadiscourse in this search of an alternative normative theory of the media."

Specifically, it attempts to answer: How could and how should we study social relations? It offers a model that maps, in general terms, where and how we should collect information when we attempt to assess any given set of relations. It highlights 3 existing strategies to the studies of relations and synthesizes them into one, interdisciplinary comprehensive model which includes a graphical model. The suggested model is intended for use mainly by social scientists of various disciplines that attempt to study, to discuss, and to teach about social relations."

My project investigates the everyday practice of news journalism in its organizational contexts in order to develop a more nuanced portrait of the forces that shape news-making today. This paper is based primarily upon 14 months of field research with German news journalists between 1996 and 2005, and focuses specifically on two issues: (1) the reconfiguration and tightening of relations between news organizations over the past 25 years and (2) the phenomenological challenges of practicing news journalism in a ""real time"" mode."

The European Social Forums as a Test Case for Citizens Participation to the EU,Audience Perspectives on the European Public Sphere,"This paper aims at understanding the possibilities for citizens participation in a European public sphere from below. It assesses the claimed public deficit and the diversification of political expression also across language barriers in the context of transnational social movements. I studied multilingual communication among citizens within the emerging alternative counter public space of the European Social Forums (ESF) process. Being part of the anti-neoliberal globalization movement, the ESF understands itself as an open arena for discussion about another Europe. Its multilingual and intercultural European-wide preparatory assemblies represent spaces in which citizens from different countries and different backgrounds communicate and reach collective decisions through participative and deliberative democracy. Based on a surprising set of results comparing national and European meetings within the ESF process, I show that multilingualism and cultural pluralism, rather than being an obstacle to democratic participation from below, stimulate the creation of a deliberative public sphere."
2007-1695,Towards an Economic Theory of Journalism,Building Core Theories About the Culture of Journalism in an Age of Relentless Change,,,,Paper,Towards an Economic Theory of Journalism,Building Core Theories About the Culture of Journalism in an Age of Relentless Change,"In this paper we suggest economic theory (resp. rational choice theory) as a promising ap-proach to analyze the dramatic changes journalism is currently going through: Journalists increasingly operate under conditions of fierce competition; at the same time they face a re-allocation of shrinking newsroom resources. While scholars of mass communication tend to focus on journalists in their role as servants to the public interest, we argue that research needs to discuss the rational self-interests of journalists as well, in order to explain phenomena such as ""pack reporting,"" the hunt for ""scoops,"" and the increasing influence of PR on journalism. Reviewing literature in the field of journalism research, communications researchers have only occasionally used concepts of economic theory to explain specific phenomena in journalism, while economists have reluctantly integrated results of communications research in their reasoning. Thus a consistent economic theory of journalism is still to be developed. Referring to the basics of economic theory, we describe journalists as rational actors seeking to maximize materialistic and nonmaterialistic rewards (e.g. attention). We explain why, how, and under what kind of restrictions journalists trade information for attention with their sources, calculating risks and benefits. Further, we apply economic concepts (free-riding, external effects, and principal-agent theory) to journalism to provide more in-depth explanations for specific developments. The conclusion: If researchers assume self-interested behavior of media professionals, they will be able to identify and predict more systematically the failures of journalism and blind spots of media coverage."

It thereafter poses the question: Has agenda setting run into a theoretical cul de sac? It tries to argue that the theory has the capacity to go beyond defining what the salient issues are and how they can be perceived, to a suggestion on what can be done about them. It suggests that in this process, the media attempt to motivate action from the audience. This is a theoretical paper whose basic assumptions can be empirically assessed to establish their veracity and usefulness in communications enquiry."

In this paper, I trace the genealogy of culture in discourses of international development, and in so doing, I also articulate ways in which inter/cultural communication perspectives on culture might be productively engaged and incorporated in development studies and practice. I begin this paper with a discussion of Foucaults (1971/1984) notion of genealogy and explain its relevance for this project. I then explain what it means to approach development as a discourse, and the implications of working within an inter/cultural communication framework. I conclude with a discussion of the ways in which inter/cultural conceptualizations of culture  culture as resource and culture as hybridity  can contribute to development studies and practice."
2007-1700,Transcoding After the Mediatic Turn: From the Community Metaphor to Web 2.0,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,,,,Paper,Transcoding After the Mediatic Turn: From the Community Metaphor to Web 2.0,Mediatic Turn: Concepts and Consequences,"When the 'mediatic turn' is conceived as the philosophical acknowledgement of media as apparatuses constituting reality, 'digital media' remain problematic. Their transversality and networking capabilities seem to go beyond 'media as such', and their digital-numerical structure (i.e. code, software) is epistemologically inaccessable for humans. How then do we relate to digital media? I argue we do so by metaphors. Metaphors provide transcoding devices, which enable the translation between digital code and cultural code, and vice versa (Manovich 2000).
I will illustrate this with the 'virtual community' metaphor, which has been used to conceptualize social dynamics on the Internet since the early nineties. Nowadays, with the advent of the scripted distributed web, this metaphor no longer seems appropriate. The community metaphor, imported from the image of a pre-modern village, is bound to a virtual delimited place and a distinct group of communicating users. Aggregated webscripts, such as blogs, with their permeable volatile borders (created by permalinks, trackbacks, RSS-feeds, and tags) seem to disrupt and refute this metaphor. Is this the end of virtual communities as we know it? What other metaphors are candidates for these new distributed forms of digital sociability?"

2007-1702,Transformation of the Conceptual Framework of 'Sovereignty',Communication and Sovereignty: Dislocations and Relocations,,,,Paper,Transformation of the Conceptual Framework of 'Sovereignty',Communication and Sovereignty: Dislocations and Relocations,"The political concept of sovereignty has been associated with the formation of national identity in 17th century Europe. Sovereignty represented not only public power over a geographic territory but also over a public information space within national borders. This concept has been challenged by the advent of new technologies, such as the telegraph, radio, television, satellite and Internet.

The paper will discuss the concept of sovereignty as it has been transformed through the challenges of an increasing cross-border communication sphere. Based on the conceptual overlap of three defining historical spheres of communication sovereignty, the paper will develop parameters of a concept for global information sovereignty."

The data for this study was drawn from 20 in-depth interviews with individuals who have experienced this transition within the same job or industry. The key findings in this study highlight the ways in which workers negotiate this identity transition. Additionally, this study identifies a variety of structural and discursive barriers that limit the sustainability of part-time work arrangements for managerial and professional employees. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."

As example, it is assumed that individuals, who are usually choosing TV programs spontaneously, prefer spontaneous selection when using other media types, too. In a first survey, questionnaires were submitted to n=382 participants who self-reported their media-use styles concerning different media types. The results confirmed the concept: Most dimensions correlated across television, newspapers, magazines, and (mass media) web-sites. Furthermore, personality measurements were found to be responsible for a considerable portion of individual TMUS. In an additional observational study, each of n=51 participants was, firstly, asked to freely watch television for 20 minutes. All actions were logged to the second. Secondly, each subject obtained 3 popular magazines which s/he could deliberately read or browse for 20 minutes. Afterwards, a copy-test of all articles read was conducted. These data, again, confirmed the TMUS concept."

In this, it represents a unique opportunity to study the links between transnational-national communicative spaces. How do different media provide spaces for societal responses and collective grieving, and how do different viewers construe meaning from the tragedy? Our paper compares transnational (CNNI) and national media (TV4) regarding: a) how the mediated time/space of the tsunami is represented in news narratives, by CNN journalists themselves, and by Swedish focus groups, b) how state and non-state actors were represented and perceived, c) and, how these actors are related to one another and to viewers in terms of belonging and community. We suggest that compassionate engagement varies with the blurring of the boundaries between national and transnational, among other factors."

Practitioners and listeners see the stations as 'community radio' but each are advertiser-driven, commercial radio broadcasting. The stations broadcast in Farsi for Iranian Americans living in Los Angeles, utilising a variety of broadacst technologies. As this study indicates, these Persian stations operate on a traditional, hierarchical closed model and actual community participation is primarily limited to call-in programmes, events listing, and opportunities for promotion of small businesses and commercial services. While one station is on the AM dial, three others operate on closed networks of side-band, analogue radio, a little-known space for FM broadcasting that can only be heard on special receivers that are tuned to the side channels. Although Iranian radio in Los Angeles cannot technically be defined as community radio, it feels like community broadcasting for both listeners and station personnel precisely because it fulfils neighbourhood-based, community-oriented objectives beyond simply offering a niche-market format, and in turn, position commercial, ethnic radio as a means by which groups can contest the space of traditional media power. What is defined as community broadcasting is in many ways contingent on what community is being asked the question. For diasporic media and ethnic broadcasting, the traditionl distinctions between models of broadcasting are far less relevent than the role that the media serve for linguistic and ethnic minorities."
2007-1707,Transnational Crossroads for Media and Diaspora: Three Challenges for Research,"Politics of Communication, Cultural Difference, and Diasporas",,,,Paper,Transnational Crossroads for Media and Diaspora: Three Challenges for Research,"Politics of Communication, Cultural Difference, and Diasporas","This paper explores three important areas of debate around the future of diaspora and media studies. The first theme interrogates the concepts and analytical categories often used in the study of media and diaspora. It argues that in the context of cosmopolitanism we need to look again at the meanings of the national vis-à-vis the transnational. Cosmopolitanism implies growing challenges to the nation-state as a coherent category and invites us to think of participation and representation outside the formal (national and international) systems of political organisation. The second theme focuses on the media and explores the relevance of the established and assumed research divide between production, text/representation, consumption. It questions the extent to which this divide is relevant in contemporary  and very diverse  media cultures. It argues that diasporic media becomes an area where this three-step media process is particularly challenged, as often the boundaries between producers and consumers are blurred. The third theme relates to the methodological practice in the study of media and diaspora. It makes a claim for more complex and diverse methodologies that draw on transnational experience, everyday life and its nuances. While research focussing on (media) consumption and identities has been extensively ethnographic and experiential, studies of the politics of diaspora have largely ignored culture and everyday experience. However, practice of everyday life can reveal many elements of political action among migrants and diasporas. This section argues that methodology needs to be more complex and take more seriously into consideration  both in design and analysis; both in the study of diasporic cultures and politics  the transnational and the local (especially the urban), the experiential and everyday."
2007-1708,"Transnational Lives, Identity, and Media","Politics of Communication, Cultural Difference, and Diasporas",,,,Paper,"Transnational Lives, Identity, and Media","Politics of Communication, Cultural Difference, and Diasporas","This paper came out of my own experience as a foreigner and my interest in finding out about the construct of a Latin American diasporic identity. The order of that experience could be translated into two points: first, on the issue of ethnic identity and diaspora, particularly in relation to the Latin American women, and second, on the role of the diasporic media in shaping a transnational identity. This is not to suggest that the diasporic and mainstream media define identities but rather that they might play a part in creating communicative spaces of inclusion and belongingness or/and segregation. In this sense, mediation is a political process as mainstream media mostly define the representation of ethnic minorities identities in the public sphere while diasporic media allow for resistance, appropriation, and counter representation as well as identity assertion. In fact, I argue that the role of the diasporic media is particularly important in mediating the experience of hybridity and migration of diasporic groups as it works as a third cultural space where diasporas are creating sites for representation and where different forms of resistance and syncretism are valued."
2007-1709,Transportation and Transportability in the Cultivation of Genre-Consistent Beliefs and Attitudes,Cultivation Theory and Research,,,,Paper,Transportation and Transportability in the Cultivation of Genre-Consistent Beliefs and Attitudes,Cultivation Theory and Research,"This study applies Green and Brocks (2002) concept of transportation into narrative to cultivation theory (Gerbner, et al. 2002). Using transportation as an indicator of intensity of the viewing experience, the relationships between genre-specific 2nd order attitudes and 1st order estimates and exposure to exemplars of genres were investigated. Viewing intensity was analyzed relative to single exposure effects, in the form of transportation, and long-term cultivation effects, in the form of a viewers transportability  tendency to be transported into stories. Participants (162) completed instruments measuring transportability, genre-related (romantic comedy, science fiction, and crime thriller) social judgments, and viewing measures. One week later they began three evenings of viewing films from each genre and completing instruments measuring transportation and genre-related social judgments. Results indicate that the extent to which viewers were transported while viewing a film was related to attitudes and estimates typically addressed in the genre. Also, transportability predicted long-term genre-specific cultivation judgments."

After providing an overview of Brazils media and political systems, the paper summarizes academic research about the contents of campaign news coverage and about media effects on voting behavior. It then develops a case study about Jornal Nacional, the prime time newscast of TV Globo, Brazils dominant media company. The case study is based on a content analysis of sixty full broadcasts of Jornal Nacional from the last five presidential elections. The analysis focuses on the question of political bias and compares the emphasis on issues frames versus horse race frames in TV Globos news coverage. The main hypothesis of the research states that the deepening of democracy in Brazil will lead to a process of media opening, with significant improvements in terms of plurality, balance, and with more emphasis on issue frames in the news coverage of presidential elections."

The German case shows how changes on the systemic level (triggered by deregulation and commercialization of the broadcast system) and changes on the organizational level (triggered by how party organizations conduct campaigns and news organizations process campaign events) and changes on the actor level (triggered by a shift from party logic to media logic as the guiding principle in the interactions between journalists and politicians) have led to an approximation of elections news discourse to transnational patterns (with regard to issue and game coverage as well as personalization and dramatization). In spite of some similarities with developments in the U.S. it would be misleading to label these changes as Americanization. Nevertheless, there seems to be a convergence of news cultures despite fundamental differences in political and media structures."

But the longer-term trends in the amount of television coverage remained negative, with far less coverage in 2004 than in the presidential elections of the 1990s. The 2004 coverage was more issue-oriented in 2004 than in 2000, but the tone of the coverage on ABC, CBS and NBC in 2004 was more one-sided (favoring John Kerry) than in any other other presidential election since since 1988."

In the aftermath of Abu Ghraib, I am concerned by a proliferation of instances where torture is a theme for ads or ""funny"" photos. This paper explores representations of torture as hip and cool. I intend to start a discussion that can help us to understand this process of trivializing torture and its potential impact over audiences. I first discuss concepts that can help in the formulation of a framework for analysis. I then focus on a few examples. They include: ""Doing the Lynndie,"" a photo craze originated after the disclosure of the abuses at Abu Ghraib; advertising campaigns to sell jeans; a popular music hit named La Tortura (The Torture)."

This study examines how print ads sell designer children's clothing to their target: affluent mothers. Drawing on the work of Goffman (1959) and Meyrowitz (1986), I observe that the young models in these ads address the camera without a smile and argue that such interpersonal fronts of domination presents a paraproxemic challenge to the viewer. Moreover, these ads adultify the children by referencing similar images of adult haute couture models. I conclude that in the context of high fashion, sexuality is not so much exposed as it is expressed."
2007-1715,Troubleshooting With Embodied Conversational Agents: Acceptance and Efficiency of a Virtual Assistant in Different Situations,The Virtual Gaze: Effects of Visuals in Embodied Agents,,,,Paper,Troubleshooting With Embodied Conversational Agents: Acceptance and Efficiency of a Virtual Assistant in Different Situations,The Virtual Gaze: Effects of Visuals in Embodied Agents,"Based on results that embodied conversational agents (ECAs) possess the potential to affect the mood of the user, it was analyzed whether an ECA interface has specific advantages when employed with privacy invading technologies such as a biometric security system. The study compares the effects of an ECA interface on user acceptance and usability with the effects of conventional text based and voice based interfaces. The main goal of the study was to analyze and compare the perceived efficiency and acceptance of the three different interfaces for a 3D face recognition device. Additionally, it was varied whether the biometric system falsely rejected the user twice or whether it directly accepted him/her. Results of the 2x3 between subjects design indicate that although overall the text interface is rated most positive, voice and ECA seem to have more advantageous consequences when problems arise  e.g. when the user is rejected repeatedly."
2007-1716,Truth Claims in Climate Change: An Inconvenient Truth as Philosophy of Communication,Parrhesia in the Public: The Ethics and Practice of Truth-Telling in Mass Media,,,,Paper,Truth Claims in Climate Change: An Inconvenient Truth as Philosophy of Communication,Parrhesia in the Public: The Ethics and Practice of Truth-Telling in Mass Media,"Popular discourse about environmental crisis is implicated in numerous philosophical issues about truth, its verification, and its communication to different audiences. These divergent positions on truth generate practical consequences regarding how we issue, evaluate and respond to forewarnings of urgent threat. This paper identifies four popular positions on truth telling and forewarning in global climate change  the positivist, the propagandist, the constructivist, and consensus  to clarify how these different views on truth underpin rhetorical strategies, situate various representational devices, and position those making claims to the truth. Taking An Inconvenient Truth as a point of departure, this paper looks at a number of these strategies and devices in their role of forwarding or contesting truth claims about climate change. Situating this film within the last 15-20 years of climate change disputation in the United State, the limitation of certain philosophical view of truth for speaking truth become evident."
2007-1717,"Truthiness and Consequence: The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, and Truth as Satire",Parrhesia in the Public: The Ethics and Practice of Truth-Telling in Mass Media,,,,Paper,"Truthiness and Consequence: The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, and Truth as Satire",Parrhesia in the Public: The Ethics and Practice of Truth-Telling in Mass Media,"In recent times, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report have had enormous influence over what counts as truth in the media public. This paper argues that both shows use irony and satire to cut through the artifice, or truthiness, of mass media discourse in ways that both serve and subvert enlightenment notions of truth-telling in the public. It will analyze the form of their discourse to show how they serve as complicated examples of parrhesiastic speech. Their satiric form of cultural critique exemplifies the tensions between Habermasian notions of a modern enlightened public and Foucaults theory of Dandyism as a necessary condition of speaking the truth. Yet at the same time, their ethic of truth-telling also constructs problematic subject positions for viewers that are fraught with the perils of cynicism. As such, these two shows allow us to problematize the potential for and impact of parrhesia in the mass media."
2007-1718,Truth or Derrida?: Différance as Medium Theory,(De-)Constructing Communication: Theorizing Mediation,,,,Paper,Truth or Derrida?: Différance as Medium Theory,(De-)Constructing Communication: Theorizing Mediation,"With communication as a medium, one is always already present in the economy of exchange, yet within that exchange there is a coetaneous presence of undecidability that haunts every act, where meaning is indeterminate and understanding is an impossible guarantee. This essay will illustrate how this gets literally performed in the play of différance between speech and writing. The Derridean notion of différance, a fissure in the structural binary between speech and writing, is one that he himself cannot overcome. This essay argues that différance should be the concern of communication scholars as a kind of rhetorical strategy that is medium-based and cannot cross communication forms."

Beginning with a framework that approaches the study in essential semiotic groundings, the author proceeds to analyze contextual and spatial patterns in lead photo coverage as well as the portrayed actions of subjects in the respective photos. The results show that photographer to subject distances and editorial decisions were influenced by cultural context and varied along the lines of culture and region. Ethical issues of dignity and privacy, as well as face-saving measures, played a role in respective editors choices of image publication. The aim of this research is to provide insight into the cultural considerations that are not simply a part of, but rather entrenched into, the perspective of the people who publish our news locally, even as events occur globally."

To date, research on relational development has focused on heterosexual romantic relationships, largely ignoring the developmental processes associated with friendship relationships. Hence, the goal of the present study is to describe the turning points individuals experience as their friendships develop and terminate. Open-ended questionnaires were utilized to provide a descriptive base for the salient turning points associated with the development and termination of dyadic friendships. These data provide a rich picture of events recalled by participants as particularly significant in characterizing the development and termination of their different friendships. The findings of this study extend previous research by broadening our understanding of relationship development beyond romantic samples and help set the stage for more in-depth, quantifiable analyses of this phenomenon."

TV Aztecas case allows reexamining the still predominant position of television domestic markets, and it relation with programming and production strategies for transnational and global scenarios. Production routines and programming strategies for transnational audiences (U.S. Latino), regional (Latin American) or global audiences have been defined by narrative parameters considered universal that have been proven successful within the Mexican domestic market. While marketers calls for the need to localized products for international audiences, corporate culture and financial realities show that media companies are trying to do the most minimal adaptations in order to reduce economical expenses (Straubhhar, 2005). TV Azteca provides a good example to think about corporate practices on television flows (Havens, 2006) and their levels of commitment of localization at cross border, regional and international levels in a context of trans-local realities (Kumar, 2006), regional linguistic markets (Sinclair, 1999) and cultural proximity (Straubhaar, 1991)."

Here, we interrogate network and cable television for the inclusion of Black gay types through an analysis of three contemporary (1990s-present) exemplar cases to illustrate the representational contexts available to gay Black men. We read media images of Black male homosexuality as controlling the representation/performance/reception of Black gay identities through depicting insufficiently masculine practices as a set of categorical attributes to be quantified, and added together, resulting in the determination of what is the gay Black man. More, we argue that heavily imbuing the performance of gay identities with such exaggeration asserts the visible, detectable nature of gay Black men, thereby controlling the definition and reception of Black mens sexualities more generally. Therefore, we offer in this essay a review and analysis of the state of Black gay men in television and conclude with suggestions for future research into the study of Black male homosexualities."

There are virtually no statistics or subsequent research that have been devoted to this population. By completing this study, we may begin to understand the plight of this stigmatized group. Homosexuality has been a part of traditional American Indian cultures in the past. The researchers will attempt to explore if this has changed in recent times. This will be achieved by interviewing gay and bisexual American Indian males in North Dakota, since so little is known about them."

This objective is particularly important for two social groups: orphans and individuals with disabilities. The show aims to erase the stigma surrounding these two groups by promoting an understanding of both adoption and disability. The following study aimed to help Ulitsa Sezams production team create material to educate for social tolerance and to assess childrens readiness to learn about adoption and disability. During formative studies of children in Moscow and Voronezh, researchers recorded childrens reactions to television segments about adoption and disability. At pretesting, most subjects knew little about adoption and disability. In post-test interviewing most children held positive attitudes towards disabled and orphaned protagonists of Ulitsa Sezam. The research resulted in the development of material that successfully fosters tolerance in young Russian viewers."

We used data of a longitudinal study in which 2 panels - the first starting at age 12, the second starting at age 15 - were followed in 3 consecutive years to explore the associations between amounts of television viewing, viewer involvement, viewing motives, sexual maturation, and channel loyalty, on the one hand, and exposure to sexually oriented television viewing, on the other. Linear mixed effects analyses indicate that only the structural determinants of television viewing (viewing amounts and channel loyalty) are significant predictors of sexually oriented viewing. The consequences of these results for future research on sexual television effects are discussed."
2007-1726,Understanding Differences in Self Construals Across Cultures: A Social Networks Perspective,New Directions in Intercultural Communication Research,,,,Paper,Understanding Differences in Self Construals Across Cultures: A Social Networks Perspective,New Directions in Intercultural Communication Research,"Self construals, one of the most influential concepts in cross cultural research are conceptualized as individual level constructs that explain culturally based differences in perception, motivation and behaviors. Rampant inconsistencies however are observed in literature severely challenging the validity of the claim concerning the role of independent vs. interdependent self-construals in mediating between country/culture differences and psychological outcomes (Bresnahan et al., 2003; Fiske, 2002; Levine, et al., 2003) In this light, this paper provides an alternative conceptualization and methodology for tapping cultural differences in self construals. This paper offers a social networks perspective to assess differences in self construals. The social networks perspective is outlined and the conceptualization of the independent self is revisited. Further the theoretical principles and models of social network are adapted to enhance our understanding of differences in social network analysis. Series of testable propositions are advanced testing cultural level and individual levels differences across cultures. In conclusion, this paper agues that prior to concluding that the concept of self construals has little merit, the core theoretical and methodological tenets of self construal research need to re -examined from the social networks perspective in order to further our understanding of the nature of self, and the contribution of culture to the construal of the self."
2007-1727,Understanding Relationships Between the Internet and Protest Strategies and Frames in the Antiglobalisation Movement,Organizational Networking on the WWW,,,,Paper,Understanding Relationships Between the Internet and Protest Strategies and Frames in the Antiglobalisation Movement,Organizational Networking on the WWW,"Scholarly commentary has highlighted the importance of the Internet in establishing and developing global networks of activists in the anti-globalization movement (Escobar, 2003). Further, recent empirical research has emphasized the importance of the Internet for spreading information, organizing and constructing networks, forming individual and group identities, and even as a form of protest itself (della Porta & Mosca, 2005). However, much research remains to be done on how anti-globalisation activists themselves interpret the Internet and its role in their organising. Such research is important because particular understandings of the Internet and its role might well affect choice of protest strategy as well as the overall frame of anti-globalisation protests themselves. Accordingly, this paper presents some initial qualitative findings from a larger study on anti-globalisation protests, focusing upon the relationship between activists perceptions of the Internet, and their ideas about protest strategies and frames. Implications for future studies will be discussed."

The main goal of the current study was to examine the associations between communication efficacy and avoidance following the discovery of a relational partners deception. This study also explored whether or not outcome assessment, information importance, partner honesty, satisfaction, and commitment are possible predictors of avoidance behavior when individuals discover their partners lie. 245 participants who reported being deceived by their relational partner completed the study. An analysis has revealed that communication efficacy was negatively associated. In addition to these findings, outcome assessment, information importance, partner honesty, satisfaction, and commitment were not significant predictors of avoidance."

Based on the landscape model of text comprehension, this study argues that framing effects of media texts like political advertisements can be understood  at least in part  as is a consequence of comprehension processes and the resulting mental models that are constructed during comprehension. The findings substantiate that people do construct different mental models for the differently framed political advertisements."

The expansion of this body of the research literature and the serious problems in some recent synthesis attempts show clearly a need for a more systematic synthesis of empirical evidence and viability of various theoretical accounts. For this purpose, a meta-analysis of all published empirical studies is conducted. This analysis covers 60 papers, 77 studies and 377 effect estimates. The findings show that the third-person perception is robust. The most robust moderators are desirability of message influence, vulnerability of target others, and others being likely audience. The paper offers a critique of the previous empirical synthesis in this area and offers several suggestions for future studies."

What was once a central concept in discussions about democracy, freedom of speech, news, or public opinion, is now seen as either irrelevant or too sensitive to deal with. This article focuses on the implications of different theories of truth for public opinion theory, in an attempt to contribute to a reincorporation of the concept of truth into the discourse on public opinion, and to a richer understanding of the possible and actual relationship between the two concepts. The central part of the article examines the complicated relationship between public opinion and the most influential theory of truth  the correspondence theory. The second part investigates the ways in which two alternative theories of truth  the coherence theory and the pragmatist theory  may broaden our perspective on this uneasy relationship and open up new conceptual venues for pursuing truth through public opinion processes."

Because most people were unaware that such comments were accepted (or even that the Commission was considering a rule change that might be of interest to them), very few informal comments were ever filed. New information and communication technologies heighten public awareness of policy making and make participation in rule making much easier. Over the past decade millions of people have emailed the Commission to express their views on proposed changes in FCC policy. All available evidence, however, suggests that these comments, despite their relevance, are mostly ignored by agency policy makers."

Usually these efforts aim to curtail antisocial or unhealthy attitudes or behaviors. One of the most disconcerting research findings is that sometimes these messages are not just unsuccessful in achieving the intended effect, but actually result in the opposite effect by causing an increase in the unhealthy or antisocial attitude or behavior. This article will examine evidence of boomerang effects in response to strategic messages, paying special attention to the unintended effects of mediated campaigns and efforts to reduce negative effects of the media. An analysis of theoretical explanations for the boomerang effect will eventuate in the proposal of a new theoretical model for the boomerang effect and discuss how human development may moderate it in certain circumstances. Finally, some ideas on how boomerang effects might be prevented or reversed will be proposed."

As evidenced by previous histories, the rationalization of its mission has fluctuated from abstract to specific in response to the emergence of an external threat. As a case study in the institutionalization of a communication medium, this paper attempts to gain a deeper understanding of those fluctuations in a contemporary context. Frame analysis is employed to identify the selective foregrounding of certain aspects of reality, or frames, in congressional hearings between 1996 and 2006. Four frames are located to illustrate the discursive shift that occurred after 9/11: (1) clear and effective communication of U.S. ideals and interests, (2) accuracy and objectivity, (3) freedom and democracy, and (4) free flow. Thematic constructs, based on American press ideals, maintain the coherence of the frames across the 2 historical periods. The result of the analysis is an intellectual history of the rationalization of a broadcast institution. This paper contributes to the descriptive and interpretive histories of United States international broadcasting. Additionally, it offers an alternative application of frame analysis, traditionally utilized in news media studies."

Numbering approximately 54 million people, many live near a larger town or even within an hour of a major city, but many also may live in far more remote regions with limited driving access, much less access to air transportation. For some  such as people living in colonias on the border with Mexico - even having access to running water or sewage treatment facilities is a distant promise. Having access to basic infrastructure such as water, sewage, electricity, and telecommunications is taken for granted in most cities across the country, but in rural areas those facilities and their attendant capabilities have come later (or not at all), and they may be inadequate. The current paper argues that a capabilities approach to public policy enhances social goods and can work with a market-based approach to telecommunications."

Results indicated no main effects for emotion frame or response efficacy, but a significant interaction suggested that only emotionally consistent presentations (fear/low efficacy; hope/high efficacy) boosted intentions to engage in protective actions. Effects of the different news constructions on trust in health news were also evidenced. Implications for the role of emotional health news coverage in priming prior knowledge about prevention health behaviors along with future research directions are discussed."

The new radical right movements in Europe provide rich theoretical and empirical cases for the study of the relationships between (1) collective memory, (2) global citizenship, and (3) transnational social movements. This paper draws on scholarship in these three areas and focuses on the European National Front, the umbrella organization for new radical right movements from 15 European countries. Two intertwined mechanisms operate at the levels of discourse construction and political mobilization. The first process is represented by cultural entrepreneurship aimed at building a repertoire of collective memory meant to represent a transnationalized, revamped radical right with its version of global citizenship and concrete political projects at the EU level. The second mechanism is advocacy of the (neo)fascist, container model of the nation using the hijacked frame of cultural diversity: different cultures are worthy of respect as long as they do no mix and are contained in regionalized and homogeneous political units (states or regions)."
2007-1741,Urban Social Networks: How Much is Enough?,Neighbours versus Friends Who Live Nearby: Communication Technology in Urban Neighbourhoods,,,,Paper,Urban Social Networks: How Much is Enough?,Neighbours versus Friends Who Live Nearby: Communication Technology in Urban Neighbourhoods,"Studies of online communities found that members typically come together to discuss a topic of interest or to contribute and receive information and support. Individual behavior varies according to their needs and the time available to participate; some are intense participants over long periods of time, some are intense for short periods only, some participate only occasionally and others watch and do not participate. Typically the community survives if there is a core of active participants generating new messages daily. The patterns of behavior that we observe in our local urban network are quite different. They are highly spasmodic and often long periods of time pass in which there is no activity and yet the community values the existence of the online network. Our urban community network is supported by a Yahoo email list which serves a community of 141 rental apartments in a block situated in northwest Washington, DC, USA. There is considerable turnover of tenants. A resident runs the listserver and membership depends on serendipitous meetings of new residents with those already on the list or with the list owner at one of the monthly community breakfasts or other social events.
The interesting thing about the list is that it is often dormant for long periods. Occasionally the list owner sends out a short news item, usually about a new restaurant or bookshop event. These emails occasionally get a response from the list but often do not. The time when the list is most active is when annual rent increases are due, or there is a problem with parking, or the swimming pool is closed too early. Participation is strongly event-related. To an onlooker the community appears dead most of the time, and yet those on the list strongly value its presence as a safety net for mass communication and response coordination in times of crisis. In this respect, it is successful. We know this because people tell us. We also know that most people are too busy to be bothered with nice communication with people that they do not know but who, by chance, happen to live in the same building. The question that I want to raise is how should a communication medium be designed to serve the needs of this group. Can we improve on an email listserver while still respecting the need of this community for low frequency, event-driven communication?"

Here the study explores that fear of crime and the perception of police/crime scene investigator among Korean students is in part a byproduct of exposure to the U.S. popular television crime show CSI. The results indicate that viewing of and perceived reality level for television crime shows among Korean students are related to increased fear of and concern about crime in the U.S. as well as more positive attitude toward the U.S. police/crime scene investigator. These results support cultivation theorys predicted effects of television on the public.

One set of tools likely to be of value in such relationships include various new information and communication technologies (ICTs) found on the Internet. Through a multi-method, longitudinal case study we examine the use and nonuse of ICTs (e.g., listserv, website) in a community of homeless service providers. Our results suggest several themes consistent with the duality of structure pertaining to reasons for, types of, and consequences of use/nonuse."

Preliminary qualitative research found that, while participants tended to feel highly vulnerable to AI, many felt there was little they could do to protect themselves and their families from transmission. In anticipation of the fall migration season, a media campaign was designed to build prevention knowledge and self-efficacy to respond appropriately and to limit the scope and consequences of another outbreak. This presentation describes the results of an October 2006 random sample survey (n=3000) conducted to assess levels of knowledge and self-efficacy to respond to AI and to support future avian and pandemic flu communication programs in Azerbaijan."

Of those individuals acquiring online information 70% say it affects their health behavior decisions. The quality of online health information is questionable as is the ability of individuals to assess, interpret and apply even accurate information correctly thereby creating a potential health risk. The current study explores the relationships of college students Internet experience, and health orientation with perceived credibility and verification. According to the findings information adopters are no more likely to verify or perceive as credible online health information, than are nonadopters.

2007-1747,User-Centered Interaction Design: Enhancing the External Validity of Communication Support for Health Care Teams,Crossing Boundaries in Communication,,,,Extended Abstract,User-Centered Interaction Design: Enhancing the External Validity of Communication Support for Health Care Teams,Crossing Boundaries in Communication,"The research project conducted through the National Cancer Institute and reported here is in the process of developing software that will support the communication of care teams made up of individuals across organizational boundaries. This proposed presentation to the ICA Interest Group focuses on the following research question: What is the role of user-centered interaction design in establishing and sustaining effective care teams? Our approach to this question, based upon a systems model of communication, is to engage potential team members in the development of: (1) communication rules for self organizing into care teams; and (2) the design of a software system to track coordinated work flow based upon those rules. This proposed presentation will address: (1) the challenges and value of engaging users in the design of communication rules for teamwork; (2) the methodology used to engage patients and health specialists in developing their communication rules for teamwork and the software to support it; (3) the results and how they are expected to inform the next steps in the research process; (4) the importance of external validity as it pertains to translating basic research into applied research; and (5) how this research project can enlighten the overall effort to improve intergroup communication, using coordinated health care as a case in point."

Methodology includes exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory analysis, and multiple regression analysis of subsequent theoretical constructs. Results describe 3 key dimensions related to consumer use of wireless broadband, including process, content, and social gratifications as previously found in studies of the Internet, as well as an embedded gratification that is unique to wireless broadband use. All 4 dimensions of gratification are relevant to managing wireless broadband, and measures developed from the gratification profiles identified here can serve as trait-valid scales in future Internet research."

Particularly, usage and satisfaction are explored as the consequences of attitude toward DMB, while informativeness, entertainment, interactivity and latent gratifications are the antecedents of attitude toward DMB. This relational model was tested with a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. SEM results indicated that the Uses and Gratifications theory explains users attitudes toward DMB. Mobile TV users who perceive DMB as entertaining and informative generally show a positive attitude toward DMB. In addition, the latent gratification of DMB has a significant relation with the users positive attitudes toward DMB. Finally, this study found that DMB users with a positive attitude toward DMB watch DMB content more often and feel more satisfied."

Given the immense popularity of hip-hop, which according to the RIAA is the second most popular musical genre, it is important to explore the process by which it was incorporated by American mainstream consumer culture. This paper focuses exclusively on Beat Street, arguably the most conventional of the eleven because it had the largest budget. Beat Street is also unique in the way that, despite being intended as highly commercial, it attempts to present an authentic and nonexploitative representation of hip-hop. This is most evident in the discourse of authenticity put forth by the films director and producer and circulated in the press. This tension between authenticity and mainstream commodification is most fully embodied by Beat Street, differentiating it from the other hip-hopsploitation films. In addition to exploring subcultural authenticity and mainstream appropriation, this paper examines the historical moment of hip-hop represented by the film, as well as what ideological and politico-cultural positions are being mobilized and reproduced by this representation. Specifically, it explores issues of gender and sexuality within and about Beat Street. Finally, it examines the overtly didactic nature of the film and the way that its social commentary, while largely oppositional, ultimately falls short of making the film truly critical of its contemporary political climate."

This presentation will discuss four studies conducted with rural adolescents to determine how technology might help change, shape, and reinforce a number of theoretically important variables that should ultimately lead to a delay in the initiation of sexual activity and to increased condom use among those who are sexually active. In tandem, these studies provide evidence that even modest computer-based interventions can influence several theoretically important variables, and even short-term behavior. A variety of practical and methodological recommendations will be discussed."

Unfortunately, both manual and automatic Content Analysis are time consuming and expensive and likely to remain so in the near future. Thus, to obtain the large data sets needed for large time series or comparative international studies, it is often necessary to share, combine, and reuse data between and within institutions. This paper describes a number of recent techniques from the Semantic
Web, a field of Knowledge Representation. Using these techniques, we propose a combination of coding close to the text, formalizing the relationship between textual categories and theoretical concepts, and using a standardized representation language for describing the media data in a self-contained manner. Finally, we show how a
currently ongoing research project actually encountered many of the mentioned problems and how this system helped to handle these difficulties."

When situations involving food safety and environmental health occur, specialized knowledge can proactively contain further damage from spreading. For a variety of reasons, however, environmental health workers who typically possess this specialized knowledge are either involved late or given a limited scope of involvement. This paper presents the usability analysis and practical applications of formative research. Interviews and focus groups were conducted to gauge the experience of environmental health and emergency management personnel in collaborating during disaster situations. The emphasis in the usability analysis was the refutation of arguments that emergency management personnel may use to delay or limit involvement of environmental health workers with specialized knowledge. Conclusions and practical application of the findings are presented for the use of web-based tools as a mechanism for fostering coordination and collaboration."

Challenges to the adoption of online support are varied and include issues related to both providers and patients. From the providers perspective, there may be a hesitation to recommend online sources of support. From a patient perspective, there may be a lack of computer knowledge and skills, lack of access to a computer or the Internet, and/or perceived privacy issues.

Despite the challenges to adoption of online health-related support communities, these eCommunities and digital education initiatives have many features that set them apart from traditional face-to-face support groups that may make them attractive to people suffering from different diseases or conditions, including increased privacy and increased availability independent of geographic or time constraints."

As encouraging student participation in such activities can be difficult (Kuh, Schuh, Whitt, Andreas, Lyons, Strange, Krehbiel, & MacKay, 1991), this project describes an effort to promote peer enhancement of campus life. Students in a persuasion course developed a campaign to increase participation on campus. Pre- and postsemester questionnaires, as well as focus groups, reveal that students anticipated participating in more campus and community activities, and their attitudes toward the purpose of college broadened. Self efficacy regarding several political tasks also improved. Students in a control group experienced no similar changes, suggesting that classroom activities can address current college students political apathy."

Is it possible to identify individuals likely to engage in behaviors that have or will endanger their health using virtual environments designed to simulate real life risks? Participants (N=108) completed a survey about their past behavior (drug use, alcohol use, sexual role preference, unprotected anal sex). They then privately viewed an interactive virtual sex HIV prevention video and their choices were recorded electronically. Participants then returned 3 months later for a follow-up survey. A series of Chi square analyses showed that virtual risk-taking was significantly related to past and future self reported risk-taking. These findings offer an exciting and innovative approach for future health interventions. Virtual environments may allow us to unobtrusively identify those most at risk and tailor interactive interventions that will be most effective for their patterns of behavior."

Its hard-won independence from the British colonial rule has not brought forth what many Sudanese had hoped for. It rather ignited north-south civil war, which has become one of the longest and brutal civil wars on the African continent, claiming more than 2 million lives. This paper aims at exploring how The New York Times represented the southern Sudanese conflict and what such representation obscured about the reality of the conflict. To this end, 45 news articles published in The New York Times from 1989-2005 were analyzed through a critical discourse analytic method with the use of frame analysis as a strategy. After the analysis of the news discourse, it is argued that The New York Times encoded the complex story of the war in binary poles characterizing it as ethnic and religious war taking place between the Arab and Islamic north on one hand and the black Africans, whom it claims are mostly Christians, in the south. Through such ethnic and religious reductionist representation of the conflict, the Times obscured, among other variables, colonial history, and politico-economic and geopolitical factors that have played a fundamental role in the southern Sudanese conflict. Although ethnicity and religion might have served as a catalyst to the conflict, the paper argues that a comprehensive understanding of the southern Sudanese conflict would be illusive without placing the colonial history, politico-economic and geopolitical factors at the heart of our analysis."

Intercultural Issues in News Coverage","Sudan, as one of the postcolonial nation-states in Africa, has one of the most complex societies brought together by colonial masters. Its hard-won independence from the British colonial rule has not brought forth what many Sudanese had hoped for. It rather ignited north-south civil war, which has become one of the longest and brutal civil wars on the African continent, claiming more than two million lives. Recently, the Darfur conflict has erupted in the western front with tragic consequences. This paper aims at exploring how The Christian Science Monitor represented both the southern and western (Darfur) Sudanese conflicts and the implication of such representation for the U.S. audience understanding of the reality of the twin conflicts. To this end, a total of 51 news articles published in The Monitor (from February 1989-June 2004 for the southern and from March 2003-March 2006 for the Darfur conflicts) were analyzed through a critical discourse analytic method with the use of frame analysis as a strategy. After the analysis of the news discourse, it was argued that The Monitor framed the complex story of the southern war in binary poles characterizing it as ethnic and religious war taking place between the Arab and Islamic north on one hand and the black Africans, who it claims are mostly Christians, in the south. On the other hand, The Monitor represented the Darfur conflict (where 98% of its population is Muslim) as one rooted in ethnic/race difference. What is more, The Monitor portrayed the warring parties--the rebels and the Sudanese government--as victims and oppressor, respectively. It depicted the Sudanese government as Arab and Islamic fundamentalist, whereas it portrayed the rebels as black Africans (who are mainly Christians--in the case of the southern rebels) fighting for freedom. In doing so, The Monitor categorized the Sudanese Arabs on one hand and black African Sudanese on the other as if they were monolithic and homogenous societies, and failed to account for differences within each group. Through such ethnic/racial and religious reductionist representation, The Monitor fixed and essentialized ethnic/racial and religious differences, and thereby obscured context and history. The paper, thus, argues that The Monitors representation of the twin conflicts was ideologically colored. As far as the implication of The Monitors portrayal of the twin conflicts for the U.S. audience understanding of the reality of the conflicts is concerned, the paper argues that given that most U.S.audience experience the Sudanese conflicts only in a mediated form, there is a likelihood that the media (of which the Monitor is one) image of the conflicts would remain their (U.S. audience) image of the conflicts. This is because as Lippmann (1965) once noted, the only feeling that anyone can have about an event he [she] does not experience is the feeling aroused by his mental image of that event (p. 9)."

Regression path analysis based on data from a national 3-wave panel survey conducted between 2002 and 2005 showed that religiosity, ideology, and deference to scientific authority had direct effects on general support for stem cell research, and for some of these value predispositions, parts of their effects were mediated by (a) institutional trust (the heuristic route) and by (b) news media use and scientific knowledge (the informational route). Conversely, although religiosity, ideology, deference to scientific authority, and authoritarian views of democratic processes in science directly influenced support for human embryonic stem cell research, most of their indirect effects were mediated by institutional trust, suggesting that citizens rely solely on the heuristic route instead of the informational route to form judgments when it comes to the more morally-loaded criterion variable. Implications for policymaking are discussed."

Under post-Fordism, the practice of self-branding is explicitly narrated, marked by the visual codes of the mainstream culture industry, and subject to the extraction of monetary value. Contemporary marketing literature identifies the construction of a branded persona as a central rhetorical strategy in the negotiation of increasingly complex corporate environments. Reality television shows such as The Apprentice and American Idol invent narratives of self-branding and simultaneously produce branded personae. On websites like 2night.com photographers take pictures of partying young people and link them to advertisements online, blurring distinctions between private self and instrumental associative object. Other websites such as facebook.com may be seen as inventories of branded selves. With self-branding, Giddens reflexive project of the self becomes a strategic and cynical practice of image-invention designed for future profit."

Through the means of a survey, 157 male respondents from a major university in the South were assessed to reveal whether unrealistic gender portrayals in video games have an effect on body type preferences in players. Respondents averaged 12.7 years of gaming experience and were divided into 3 groups: nongamers, casual gamers, and hardcore gamers. Although the study yielded some insignificant results, findings revealed that hard-core gamers see the average woman as much larger than do nongamers, body type preferences for hardcore gamers possessed larger breasts than those of nongamers, and hardcore gamers may make a higher degree of social comparison between real women and female video gamers. Suggestions for future research are presented."

Lazarsfeld and Mertons (1964) homophily theory serves as the theoretical justification for research questions addressing participants (N=224) attitude evaluations of the couples featured in the ad, the brand, the advertisement, and behavioral intentions related to the product. Attitudes toward the couples featured in the advertisements were predicted by their sexual orientation, which also served as a predictor of attitudes toward the advertisement. Interestingly, evaluations of the couples did not transfer to attitudes toward the brand or behavioral intentions, which were primarily predicted by argument type used in the ads. Race was not a significant predictor of attitudes or behavioral responses."

In contrast to universal portals, affinity portals are oriented towards specific populations marketers believe comprise profitable niche markets. The keystone of the affinity portal model is the image of community, and by invoking community these portals invite the emotional investment of patrons. However, unlike those online communities evolving organically through noncommercial sites, affinity portals are engineered by corporate actors as commercial ventures predicated on identity-based consumption. These engineered communities raise concerns over how commercial ventures balance the political aspirations of marginalized populations with the corporate imperatives of profit. This study examines one of the most financially successful affinity portals and the leading commercial site targeting sexual minorities  Gay.com  in an effort to assess the potential for these sites to constitute viable public spheres. This study is based on an analysis of 518 postings made by Gay.com patrons in response to 4 polemical news stories reported on that site. Story selection was based on both the unusually high number of patron responses and the distinct political issues each raises  gay civil rights, gay identity politics, the role of organized religion in LGBT life, and sexual representation in the media. Employing an approach from social psychology referred to as interpretive repertoire analysis, this study aims to identify which forms of civic discourse are promoted on the site and which are contained or absent."

An avatar platform is used to transmit and display nonverbal behaviour (head and body movement, gestures) as captured by motion capture devices and data gloves in real time while a computer algorithm is substituting the real gaze behaviour of one of the interlocutors by simulated gaze sequences. Duration of directed gaze (looking into the face of the vis-a-vis) was varied as an independent variable, lasting 2 seconds in one condition and four seconds in the other. Person perception as measured by means of an adjective list and social presence as measured by means of a short questionnaire served as dependent variables. The results underline the validity of the computer animation approach. Consistent with the literature the longer gaze duration was found to cause significantly better evaluations of the interaction partner."

Wikipedia is an online, free access, volunteer-contributed encyclopedia. Previous studies concerning Wikipedia investigated its functions as an on-line volunteer-contributed encyclopedia, as a community, the value of its content and its co-authoring aspects.
Following a brief description of Wikipedia features and their relevance to our study (e.g. features that enables interactivity), we discuss the process of knowledge building in community and the motivations of Wikipedia participants that contribute to its content and taking (or not) part in its community. A central tenet of wiki community is users' motivation to contribute. We studied Wikipedians motivations utilizing the Uses & Gratifications approach that investigates how people use the media to gratify their needs. Using these perspectives, we highlight user's cognitive and integrative gratifications.
To survey Wikipedians on these aspects, we posted a link to an online web questionnaire in the 'Community Portal', a central page on the Wikipedia website. We then repeated this procedure in several language-based Wikipedia to search for culturally biased differences. Some preliminary cross-cultural survey data from the English and Hebrew Wikipedia will be presented."

I pay close attention to the ways media contribute to and reflect the shift towards public visibility of sexual minorities. I exemplify the ways in which the mainstream media contribute to the construction of hierarchies and naturalization of heterosexuality. I comment on the significance of Slovak LGBT publications as important sites of counterknowledge about gender and sexual difference created by and for minority groups that have contributed to the visibility of sexual minorities in the context of transformations put in motion by the events in 1989."

This paper addresses this lacuna, first by elaborating central concepts and theoretical tenets from the field of visual culture, and then by suggesting how they can contribute to critical reflective analysis of journalism, viewed both historically and in the present media environment. The paper includes a discussion of how a visual culture perspective can extend the study of journalism cultures beyond specific media forms and their audiences, using examples from current research."

Those images are now iconic, but they, and the events they showed, unleashed an unprecedented global discourse about politics, modernity, andmost importantlyreligion. Competing frames for the containment of images have emerged, opening a challenging avenue of inquiry about the nature of ritual as these claims have emerged from both traditionally religious and more broadly social contexts. Competing claims have emerged - about authenticity on the one hand (as in images from the recent Lebanon war) and for authenticity by bricoleurs of images (such as in a variety of cases from the 9/11 events and their commemoration) on the other hand. This paper will review the trajectory of key post-9/11 images, reflecting on visual, ritual, and religion theory, and will address what these cases tell us about the place of images in emerging global discourses of meaning, ritual, and religion."

The analysis is a partial replication of a 2000 study by Sung Tae Kim that analyzed news stories about the same two movements in the same publications and the subsequent crackdowns by government forces. The photographs were coded using measures similar to those used in the Kim studyMain Subject Matter and Content Slantand an additional measure commonly used on photographs, Manifest Content. Findings indicate that, contrary to the Kim study showing that the news frame generated by text coverage conformed closely to U.S. foreign policy, the news frame generated by the photographic coverage was nearly identical for both prodemocracy movements and, in the case of Kwangju, was contrary to the official policy position. The authors conclude that photographs contribute to the framing of international news events in a manner thats unlike the contribution of text reports, or at least, may not be as prone to conform to government foreign policy perspectives. They speculate that differences inherent in the mental processing of photographs (emotive rather than discursive) and differences in the sources consulted by photojournalists in the field provide partial explanation, but call for additional study into the interaction between visual and textual elements in the generation of news frames."

As distinct cultural groups such as the Maasai seek to adopt to the social, political, economic, and cultural influences around them and yet maintain their own cultural identity, new avenues of communication and development become available to them. The present study explores how members of the Maasai community in the Longido District of Tanzania communicate their identity through the use of digital cameras. Utilizing visual ethnography as our research approach, our study reveals that oral cultures like the Maasai can quickly adapt to the storytelling opportunities provided by digital photography. Using digital cameras can be an effective means for learning how a culture responds to the demands of assimilation in developing nations. Implications of our findings for future visual communication studies are discussed."
2007-1780,Voice of the City? WNYC-TV and Municipal Broadcasting in the United States 1947-1996,MEA at ICA 2007: Media Ecological Critiques of Power and Control in Communication,,,,Paper,Voice of the City? WNYC-TV and Municipal Broadcasting in the United States 1947-1996,MEA at ICA 2007: Media Ecological Critiques of Power and Control in Communication,"While many metropolitan areas of the United States have educational and public television outlets operating under noncommercial licenses from the FCC, New York is unique in that in 1952 the City of New York was granted a commercial license to operate WNYC-TV over UHF Channel 31. This television station never operated commercially, but from 1961 until 1996, it operated as a part of NYCs existing Municipal Broadcasting System, bringing news and information programs to the citizens, and providing an outlet for programming created by the many diverse communities of New York City.
The attribute that distinguished WNYC-TV from other noncommercial televisions stations is that it was municipally owned and operated. Thus, even though it did, in the early 1970s, become affiliated with the Public Broadcasting Service, it was always run with a budget from the City of New York and employees of WNYC-TV were municipal employees and civil servants. This peculiar situation allows for an examination of the ecology of media ownership and control, politics, and urban citizenship and a critique of the development and implementation of television broadcasting and its regulation in the United States.
This paper presents a history of WNYC-TV from its genesis as WUHF (a joint experiment in UHF broadcasting funded by both NYC and the FCC) through its demise when Rudolph Giuliani sold it (ironically to Michael Bloombergs company) in part because municipalities have no reason to be in the broadcasting business. It examines the relationship between government and government-created and sponsored broadcasting as well as the regulations that affected this unusual broadcast outlet. Ultimately, it traces the deeper reasons behind WNYC-TVs demise, suggesting that the project, however idealistic and progressive it may have been, was doomed from the start by the structure of American broadcasting and broadcast regulation."

Combining a directional motivation (motivation to a particular candidate which is predicted by strength of party identification) and a nondirectional motivation (motivation to think about election which is predicted by the level of interest in politics) four types of voters were identified. Four types of voters are expected to show different patterns of biased information processing. Voters with strong party identification and high interest in politics were expected to show the highest degree of biased information processing. When specific information about candidates issue-position was presented, higher degree of biased processing was also expected. The pattern of biased information processing was examined with candidate evaluation trajectories, which consisted of candidate evaluation at 11 time-points. It was found that participants with strong party identification and high interest in politics were less likely to change the initially preferred candidate, took longer time to change the initially preferred candidate, and changed candidate evaluation more slowly in response to a series of attitudinally incongruent information about candidates than other groups of participants."

Gender Differences in the Visualization of Political Scandals","""Size Matters"": Current Approaches to the Study of Photography and Visual Design (High Density Session)","This paper deals with the phenomenon commonly labelled political scandal (Thompson 1995, 2000). Our study of three political scandals in the print media, where a general framework of discourse analysis has been applied, is concerned with aspects of media, gender, power and celebrity. Main areas of interest are the journalistic use of visual techniques, and given that press photographers and photo editors in general are men, what actions and situations are seen as interesting to put forward in the visualization of male and female politicians? We will show how journalists, using visuals, actively reuse previous knowledge, experience, and assumptions based on prior scandals when the discursive frame or image of a politician is constructed in a new scandal. This seems to be even more true when the politician in question is a woman, possibly because women are used more actively in the construction of an emotional scandal narrative. We also believe that we have found significant gender-based differences in the visual construction of male and female politicians respectively which will be further exemplified in the paper. Lastly, we argue that gender-bias in a political scandal is not only linked to traditional conceptions and stereotypical notions of men and women, but can be defined and constructed in various ways depending on each politicians media biography."
2007-1783,War and the rise of public anxiety: the cases of the US and Israel.,Media Wars: Lessons From Lebanon,,,,Paper,War and the rise of public anxiety: the cases of the US and Israel.,Media Wars: Lessons From Lebanon,"The paper argues that since 9 11, and the wars that followed in its wake, the American public experiences a sense of anxiety about self-defense, evidenced in uncertainty about such things as the nature of extant threat to the nation, or accurately identifying enemies, or even recognizing victories and defeats. The paper offers a phenomenological analysis of the ways in which the concepts of ""self-defense"" and ""security"" are conceived, claiming that they need to be understood not just in the context of a specific sequence of attack and wars, covered extensively by the media, but rather as a function of a more generalized territorial and historical state of disorientation.A parallel process may be seen in the case of the Israeli public which since the failure of the Oslo peace process, and the violence and war that followed, has regressed to experiencing the existential anxiety felt before the establishment of the state in 1948."

Selecting all 250+ word articles on the topic between 12/07/05 and 03/17/2006 (283 articles) city characteristics were compared systematically with a composite measure of coverage, combining article prominence and direction to calculate a Media Vector for each newspaper, ranging from +.06 to -.263. A large majority of city newspapers, 15 of 18, manifested unfavorable coverage. Pearson correlations revealed 4 clusters of city characteristics had significant relationships to newspaper coverage of warrantless eavesdropping: Stakeholder/Partisanship (percent voting Republican: r = .458, p = .028; voting Democratic: r = -.453, p = .030); Vulnerability/Ethnic Identity ( violent crime: r = .585, p = .011; crime rate: r = .573, p = .013); Violated Buffer (homeowners: r = .490, p = .019); and Belief Systems (percent devotional readers: r = .753, p = .000; percent Catholic: r = -.594, p = .005; percent Evangelical: r = .574, p = .006). Belief Systems yielded the most significant results; regression analysis found devotional reading accounted for 64% of the variance. Finding that different religious orientations are associated with both support for and opposition to warrantless wiretapping has significant implications for public policy and social science research."

Based on the literature surrounding parasocial relationships (Horton and Wohl, 1956) and group spectatorship (Branscombe & Wann, 1991; 1992; 1995), as well as literature that suggests high sociability among reality TV viewers (Reiss & Wiltz, 2004), this study analyzes the differences between viewer enjoyment and of reality television and parasocial engagement with reality characters, between groups of viewers and individuals. It also analyzes how individuals use group discussion to actively interpret media text, and the role of this dicussion in the formation of individual attitudes. 104 undergraduate students were divided into either a group or solo viewing condition to view an episode of a reality television show. Show enjoyment was significantly higher for those in groups, but there were no differences between solo and group viewers on parasocial engagement. Group discussion was videotaped and transcripts were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, revealing that parasocial interaction such as empathy and directly addressing characters, transportation, and personalization of content, or comparing television to personal experiences, are themes used by individuals to interpret media texts. Hierarchical linear modeling techniques reveal that total amount of statements at the group level can predict individual-level scores of parasocial engagement."

Bleep is one-part entertainment and one-part self- development tool with a message similar to that in other healthy living media: one should become conscious in order to experience abundance and happiness and to aid others in doing so as well. Bleep is commonly featured in other media in the healthy living marketplace, a sector said to appeal to nearly one-quarter of American adults known as Cultural Creatives, the majority of whom are women. This is an ethnographic and textual analysis of the film and its audiences that explores how a construction of individual success is configured within the scope of the global economy and the implications of that for the gendered self as social change-agent."

The sense of common purpose of community stations has been from the beginning reflected on air, as stations have shared materials with each other through tape exchanges and similar systems. However, such mechanisms are slow and require a high degree of coordination and cooperation, not always an easy task in volunteer-dominated organizations. The emergence of podcasting and webcasting provides, therefore, a significant development in how stations are able to interact with each other and broader social and political movements. While improving the potential for strengthening bonds among community stations, and for stations to position themselves within diffuse social movements this also challenges the traditional concentration on the maintenance of local community. Various questions arise, therefore as to how these developments are changing how community radio is envisaged by those participating in it and whether these emerging technologies and changing forms are contributing to an evolution in the subjectivity of community radio."

This paper examines the expansion of the Internet and the rise of weblogs in Iran in its wider social context. It will be shown how the combination of market forces and state policies are suppressing the democratic and participatory potentials of the Internet. The case of Iran while demonstrating the real potential of new technologies for empowerment of citizens, also shows that the realisation of this dream and the potential of Internet depend on access and (political) entitlements for all. This paper looks at how the battle to control weblogs/bloggers is evolving in Iran. It examines different layers and methods of control and censorship, as well as significant moments of dispute. The paper will demonstrate how the very contradictory nature and factionalism of the Iranian state inevitably makes for an intriguing and contradictory blogosphere environment, and how the potentials of new media are constrained by confusion in government policies, varied institutional interests and above all the dialectical tension between the imperative of the market and the revolutionary claims of the Iranian state."

Specifically, limited research directly measures outcomes of citizens' experiences on government web sites. This study examines relationships between web site attributes and citizen attitudes toward e-government following an experiment in which participants completed identical tasks on 1 of 2 different versions of a government web site. Multiple regression path analysis reveals the strong role of web site usability in positively impacting user judgments of credibility and content quality, which, in turn, positively affect e-government attitude. E-government familiarity also is shown to positively affect e-government attitude. Citizen Internet usage appears to affect e-government attitudes differently depending on the version of the web site viewed. Findings are discussed in terms of goal-oriented e-government users, uses and gratifications theory and aspects of interactive media theory."

The 30-and 60-second television commercials featured six professional athletes who ""put their game faces on"" (masks) in the fast paced ad for athletic clothing. The masks were not associated with the athlete's sport; instead served as symbolic stand-ins for the athlete's self-identified persona. Linebacker Brian Urlacher, for example, wears a barbed wire cage over his head. These otherwise ""mild mannered"" athletes are transformed/morphed into images similar to those in slasher films and violent video games. Tapping into testosterone driven maleness of sporting events (particularly football), this advertising campaign draws on violent, dominating archetypes of masculinity. This paper examines the television campaign through the lens of semiotics, analytical psychology, and mythological theory to unpack the codes of constructed American masculinity."

Emerging communication technologies allow people to communicate in ways that place them in shifting capitalist formations. Interviews with human resources staff at various call centers in San Salvador, El Salvador indicate that call center work is represented by recruiters and government agencies as a desirable job option for English-speaking Salvadorans because it involves the use of linguistic and technical skills within a work culture that produces awareness of a condition called globalization, or at least awareness of transnational capitalism and the dislocation of telephone voices. Spanish/English bilingualism is an important asset for prospective employees, while training often emphasizes listening comprehension and the improvement of an American English accent to attend United States customers. Meanwhile, Salvadoran call center workers are advertised by investment promoters as workers with neutral accentsin this claim, Salvadoran Spanish is not as marked as the distinctive intonations of other Latin American varieties (e.g. Mexico, Argentina). The expanding call center sector is in part shaped by the state, technological advances, and ideas about the linguistic and professional capacities of the Salvadoran workforce. The call center, where disembodied voices are localized and commercialized, is an example of the many reconfigurations of globalization as lived in communities and institutions."

Within this environment of forced and voluntary mobility, Latina/os are one of the most dynamic segments of the U.S. population, with its youth component significantly growing at a faster pace than other age cohorts. Simultaneously, as the symbolic register of our national imaginary, mainstream popular culture represents our values, fears, and desires within a matrix of power. That Latina/os are becoming more visible in mass media is a documented fact by many media scholars. However, and for the purposes of this roundtable, my focus centers on Latina girls. How much do we know about Latina girls and popular culture scholarship? How much do we know about girls in Latina/o scholarship? Are Latina girls represented in mainstream popular culture and if so how? What are the implications of representation for Latina girl recognition? Do Latina girls engage with mainstream popular culture and if so how? This set of interrogations cannot be answered fully as the research has only begun to be conducted. Nonetheless from what is available we can proceed to make some cautionary hypotheses as well as to pursue productive venues of further research.

Mediatization as a Process of Cultural Change,Reconsidering the Media-Society Nexus: The Mediatization of Society  the Mediation of Meaning,"The question what effect do media have? has been a dominant research focus of media and communication studies ever since Harold Lasswells model of communication. While traditional effect research tries to analyse effects of specific media contents, our paper outlines a different understanding: We argue that the main effect media have is their long-standing and increasing interpenetration of different aspects of cultural life by appropriation or domestication of technology-based communication  a process we call mediatization. Mediatization in this sense has an effect as it reshapes symbolic forms of culture and their modes of production and circulation. In a first step our paper outlines this concept of mediatization as a process of cultural change. In a second step we will then demonstrate based on our own ethnographic research the capacity of the concept of mediatization for media and communication studies."

An account of the form of the technology (how it presents itself as an appliance for everyday use in everyday situations) begins to reveal its for-anyone care-structure. A consideration of what happens when it is activated (turned on) reveals a series of interconnected transformations that change the status of the equipment itself, of the user, of the equipment, and of his or her spatio-temporal situation. The world-disclosive character of television is found to be, in the first instance, an affordance of a technological apparatus, designed for general human use, that links in each case my world and my time to the life and times of the world."

The results of a previous experiment indicated that organizational communication satisfaction was more a function of work value fulfillment than of met expectations. This study tested that finding by asking participants to recall actual work experiences and to complete a series of three questionnaires. Results of OLS regression analyses showed that neither a pure met expectations nor a pure value fulfillment hypothesis best explains organizational communication satisfaction. Instead, the results show that organizational communication satisfaction is a function of both met expectations and work value fulfillment, with work value fulfillment playing the primary role. Additionally, total work experience was found to negatively impact organizational communication satisfaction, while work hours per week were found to positively impact organizational communication satisfaction. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed."

A Comparative Snapshot of Community Radio,(Dis)connecting Communities,"An increased level of attention has been paid recently to the future of digital, satellite, and Internet radio as a means for circulating information and culture irrespective of geographic boundaries and as a means of subverting the dilemma of scarcity within the limited analogue bandwidth. At the same time, terrestrial radio itself exists within the regulatory parameters of national broadcast policy. What is interesting is that while the Internet and, to a lesser extent, other digital means of delivery, address the problem of scarcity, there has been an increasing amount of grassroots pressure and regulatory progress made towards the development of low-power community radio sectors around the globe. Analogue radio remains the primary means of news and broadcast entertainment for large parts of the world and radio itself remains largely a local experience. This paper offers a comparative examination of community radio policy and practice, arguing that media policy is not neutral. It is a contested space through which conditions for creating 'citizen' access to broadcasting are wrestled with. While at the same time, community radio practice offers participatory models of media-making."

Various definitions have been given to Politics, yet seldom do these definition rely on actual conversation from everyday life. This paper present and then discuss one such conversation taken from political radio phone-ins program in Israel. The analysis demonstrates how in a single conversation the caller acts as if it is a political conversation whereas the hosts acts as if it is not a political conversation. The different viewpoints, which participants nay hold about the essence of a conversation about its essence, lead to an ethnomethodological perspective on political conversation. Politics and political conversation is a social process that is achieved via negotiation over the definition of the situation and the framing of it. When a shared frame and a shared definition of the situation is achieved and agreed upon as political the participants participate in political conversation. Thus, the political conversation is based upon the participants' agreement over the definition of the situation, an agreement which is achieved through the process of and the negotiation within the conversation."

Despite its wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios, a major producer of childrens media, has often been criticized for the content of its films. This content analysis examines the amount of violent incidents in 24 Disney G-rated, animated, full-length feature films released between 1937 and 2000. Since research indicates that television violence tends to impact child behavior, Disney films were assessed three ways for their violent content: (a) the number of violent incidents per film, (b) the types of weapons used for violence per film, and (c) the acceptance or rejection of violent acts by characters as appropriate behavior in each film. This analysis found 464 violent incidents portrayed in Disney films and 564 weapons used in these incidents. Moreover, this analysis found an increase in violence with each successive decade of Disney films."

New Perspectives on Motivations to Play Video Games,"Massively multiplayer online role-playing games have gained worldwide popularity. Majority of the past research focuses on motivational factors, this study aims to understand what makes players enjoy and commit to game play. Based on data collected through 40 in-depth interviews with core and causal gamers (who spent on average 36.65 and 10.62 hours per week playing respectively), it is found that (a) the balance between perceived challenges and skills, (b) the types of in-game social interactions and (c) technical aspects of games can facilitate and impede the enjoyment of game playing. The amount of time a gamer spends gaming results in different state of enjoyment. Moreover, view on social interaction is the key factor differentiates core and causal gamers. Core gamers view social interaction as the most critical element for their game play; however, causal gamers view it as an unimportant aspect. It is the sense of community within the game, an acquired online identity and the spectacle of the gaming world that makes social interaction meaningful for gamers."

An Update on the Overlooked: Stock Photography and the Visual Content Industry,"""Size Matters"": Current Approaches to the Study of Photography and Visual Design (High Density Session)","This paper analyses developments over the past three years in the stock photography industry, the global multi-billion dollar business that manufactures the majority of advertising and marketing images, and an increasing number of editorial and news photographs. Focusing on how the industry shapes the visual background to our lives - and the monopoly of appearance (Debord 1970: 12) of our societies - the paper critically examines stock photographys place at the very frontier of contemporary cultural dynamics: technological change, globalization, struggles over the legal and social definitions of intellectual property and cultural authority, the aestheticization of the lifeworld, and the apparently ceaseless conquest of material and virtual spaces by increasing numbers of visual images. It does this by briefly looking in turn at three interlinked questions: 1) how does the industry currently organize representational power and cultural authority; 2) what is the reach of the industry, geographically, historically (control over archives) and in terms of economic sector (in relation to other cultural industries); 3) what does the spectacle look like  what visual regime characterizes the stock industry and the domains it supplies?"

The basic idea is to code messages into an if-part (nutrition, physical activity, body weight) and a then-part (weight and health). Detailed codeplans can then be used to determine the specific nature of the if- and then-parts of an assertion. An exemplary analysis of Swiss-German newspaper and magazine messages between March 1, 2003 and June 30, 2005 provides evidence of recommendations that are more or less in line with official suggestions for a healthy diet: Newspapers and magazines tell their readers to eat vegetables, fruit, grain and cereal products, dairy products, and to care about vitamin and minerals intake. They also advise to stay away from tobacco, alcohol, fast food, sugar, and animal fat. Results are interpreted as evidence for the existence of a rather good source for diet information in print media, which is, however, very likely to be counteracted by other media content."
2007-1808,When a Fear Appeal Isnt a Fear Appeal: The Effects of Graphic Antitobacco Messages,"Assessing Risk, Defining Fear, and Understanding Perceived Control: Implications for Health Communication",,,,Paper,When a Fear Appeal Isnt a Fear Appeal: The Effects of Graphic Antitobacco Messages,"Assessing Risk, Defining Fear, and Understanding Perceived Control: Implications for Health Communication","The current study experimentally tested two types of common antitobacco television ad messagesthose that contained a health threat about tobacco use (fear) and those that contained a negative graphic image (disgust)on how viewers processed these messages. Informed by the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP, A. Lang, 2006), we hypothesized that how well a message was processed depended on the type of emotional message content. In a 2 x 2 within-subjects experiment, participants watched antitobacco television ads that varied in the amount of fear and disgust content. The results of this study suggest that both fear and disgust content in antitobacco television ads have significant effects on resources allocated to encoding the messages and on recognition memory. Recognition was most accurate for messages that were high in fear but low in disgust. Messages that contained disgust were recognized faster than messages without, but having a disgusting image in a high-fear message decreased recognition latency. Secondary task reaction times indicated that the combination of fear and disgust reduced resources available for encoding compared to messages high in disgust but low in fear. The results are discussed in the context of coactivation theory and recommendations about message construction are offered to health campaign designers."
2007-1809,When Electoral Democracy Goes Bad: Examining Administrative Discourses on Democracy Before and After the Electoral Wins of Hamas and Hezbollah,Alternative Voices: Investigating Discourses About and Within Islam and the Middle East,,,,Paper,When Electoral Democracy Goes Bad: Examining Administrative Discourses on Democracy Before and After the Electoral Wins of Hamas and Hezbollah,Alternative Voices: Investigating Discourses About and Within Islam and the Middle East,"One of the most pressing foreign policy issues of the current US administration concerns the establishment of democracy in the Middle East. However, official communications about democracy and its practical application in the region are somewhat unclear and widely contested. Many Middle Eastern criticisms of US policy, including those made by some ""terrorist"" organizations, claim the US is inconsistent in promoting its ideals of democracy. In order to investigate such claims, this study analyzes US foreign policy messages about democracy in the Middle East, both before and after the elections in Lebanon and Palestine. A narrative analysis yields insights into the rhetorical techniques used by the administration to create an interpretive frame for rationalizing US policy and outlining its suggested role for democracy in the Middle East. The tenets of their messages are delineated to identify the consistency with which they suggest preferred readings for these two events."
2007-1810,When Fake Gets Real: News as Activism and Fandom as Citizenship,Laughing Through Your Tears: Humor and 9/11,,,,Paper,When Fake Gets Real: News as Activism and Fandom as Citizenship,Laughing Through Your Tears: Humor and 9/11,"Popular late night comedy news formats are often subject to alarmist analyses suggesting that young people get their news from entertainment rather than more traditional venues. The question of whether these shows debase and trivialize political culture, disengage the public, and overall negatively impact the democratic process through infotainment is usually foregrounded and decontextualized. Conversely, theorists such as van Zoonen and Jones explain how politics in popular televisual formats can be informative and politically engaging as well as pleasurable. Van Zoonens argues that fan groups are structurally equivalent to political constituencies, in which fandom is linked to political citizenship through affective identification. This paper argues that these shows, through satire and parody, operate as barometers of a post-9/11 socio-political environment in which inquiry, criticism, and dissent are under attack. Through a close-analysis of Stephen Colberts constructed, ironic celebrity persona, it argues that such examples of popular media produce an audience subjectivity that is overtly political, calling forth a public of citizen-fans who in their smartness exercise political resistance and expose the folly of the political right."

This paper builds on research demonstrating the relationship between self-efficacy and the performance of health behaviors, and literature on efficacy-boosting campaigns to propose messages targeting those low in perceived self-efficacy toward a given behavior. Research must first identify the root of the low self-efficacy, as different roots will necessitate different design structures. Toward this end, a survey was administered to undergraduate students (N = 107) at a large, Western U.S. university regarding difficult health behaviors to perform, barriers to the performance, factors to facilitate behavioral change, degree of desire to change, and previous attempts at change. Nominal data was collected on 15 behaviors, 15 barriers, and 15 facilitators. The most common behaviors (eat healthy, exercise, drink less, sleep more, schedule healthcare visits, quit smoking, and wear sunscreen) are examined in depth. Directions for future research aimed at designing health promotion campaigns targeting undergraduate populations are addressed."
2007-1812,When Journalisms Images of Violence Act as Contemporary Spectacles of Suffering,Violent Imagery as Spectacle and Normality: New Theoretical Perspectives,,,,Paper,When Journalisms Images of Violence Act as Contemporary Spectacles of Suffering,Violent Imagery as Spectacle and Normality: New Theoretical Perspectives,"This paper tracks how contemporary news images of violence, death, trauma and atrocity follow upon a longstanding tradition of spectacles of suffering. Such spectacles, which date back to medieval times and have strong roots in Christianity, depend upon the acquiescence and presence of viewing publics to exert the surveillance and control they are fashioned to produce. News images tend to be free of the rhetoric of surveillance and control which they exert, primarily because they are seen as the justifiable depiction of newsworthy events. This paper addresses the problematics of this circumstance, showing that in events as wide-ranging as the beheading videos of the Iraq war and the images from Abu Ghraib, journalisms images of violence are often selected for display by non-journalists, raising fundamental questions about who makes the call to show spectacles of suffering in journalisms name, and for what aim."
2007-1813,When Lobbying Backfires: Balancing Lobby Efforts With Insights From Stakeholder Theory,Crisis and Risk Communication,,,,Paper,When Lobbying Backfires: Balancing Lobby Efforts With Insights From Stakeholder Theory,Crisis and Risk Communication,"This paper seeks to improve upon lobby theory by learning from a failed lobby campaign in which the lobbyist managed to annoy and anger key constituencies. A qualitative case study was conducted on attempts made by the Norwegian oil industry in 20022004 to achieve a tax amendment. Qualitative interviews were carried out with oil industry representatives, two former ministers, political advisors, and members of parliament, and with journalists who had followed the campaign. The main argument being put forward in this paper is that lobbyists should use insights from stakeholder theory. Combining lobby theory with an approach suggested by stakeholder theory might temper single-minded advocacy that is too preoccupied with getting immediate political results, and help organizations to remember that it is important to develop good long-term relations with stakeholders."
2007-1814,When More Media Equals Less News,Constructing News in the New Media Age,,,,Paper,When More Media Equals Less News,Constructing News in the New Media Age,"This paper examines content homogeneity, understood as the degree to which different media focus on the same stories during a particular news cycle, in the Argentine leading print and online newspapers. It focuses on the role of technical practices across media and over timeduring a decade for print and during 24 hours for online. The analysis shows 3 main patterns of homogenization: a) an increase in the level of homogeneity in print newspapers tied to their online counterparts practice of publishing breaking and developing stories during the day; b) an increase in the level of homogeneity in online newspapers as the day unfolds; and, c) a densely interconnected web of homogeneity across print and online newspapers in 2005. We draw from these findings to make contributions to research on online news and media sociology, and to reflect upon the direction and meaning of changes in journalistic form in the current media environment."
2007-1815,"When National Taboos Go Global: Collective Memory, State and National Identity in Turkey",The Governance of Collective Memory: Transnational Institutions and Identity Politics in Europe,,,,Paper,"When National Taboos Go Global: Collective Memory, State and National Identity in Turkey",The Governance of Collective Memory: Transnational Institutions and Identity Politics in Europe,"Two recent events have triggered a heated public debate in Turkey, revealing the complex relationship among collective memory, state discourses, national identity, freedom of expression and the role of intellectuals as knowledge producers. First, Elif Safak faced charges for her latest novel, The Bastard of İstanbul, under article 301 of the Turkish criminal code, which criminalizes any form of expression degrading Turkish national identity. Her novel brought up various perspectives of Armenian-Turkish history that are considered taboo in Turkey. Later, the controversial novelist Orhan Pamuk, who was also prosecuted under article 301 for acknowledging in the international arena the Armenian genocide and the Kurdish question, became the first Turkish Nobel Prize winner in literature. Historically and politically contextualizing the representations of those events within the commentary sections of three national newspapers (Radikal, Cumhuriyet and Zaman) that represent the political spectrum of Turkish intellectuals, this paper addresses the following questions: What are the challenges introduced by globalization for local intellectuals in redefining their identities against/within the discourses of the state, collective memory, nationalism and universal rights of expression? How does globalization lead to the interrogation of the relationship between Turkish identity and the locally established political views of leftism, secularism and Islamism?"
2007-1816,When Outcome Expectations Become Habitual: Explaining vs. Predicting New Media Technology Use From a Social Cognitive Perspective,Mobile Communication Adoption,,,,Paper,When Outcome Expectations Become Habitual: Explaining vs. Predicting New Media Technology Use From a Social Cognitive Perspective,Mobile Communication Adoption,"This study examined the triadic relationship between expected outcomes, habit strength, and media technology use within the model of media attendance (Larose & Eastin, 2004). Mobile phone users (N = 664) were divided into two groups using a stratified random sampling method. Respondents of group one (n = 334) were surveyed on existing mobile phone use, respondents of group two (n = 310) were surveyed on the intention to use mobile video phone. On the basis of structural equation analysis, the results of this study support the assumption that within the model of media attendance existing media use is more likely to be explained by habit strength, and new media use is more likely to be predicted by outcome expectations."
2007-1817,When Referendum Campaigns Matter - And Why,vestigating Referendum Campaigns: Theory and Methodology From an International Perspective,,,,Paper,When Referendum Campaigns Matter - And Why,Investigating Referendum Campaigns: Theory and Methodology From an International Perspective,"Given the key characteristics of referendums  volatile electorates, uncertainty in elite cues, and issue complexity  campaigns may matter more than in other electoral situations. The magnitude of campaign effects is conditional upon the overall volatility present in the political system and the extent to which voting in the referendum is aligned with party politics. Theories of voting behavior generally emphasize the importance of party support or attachment as well as contextual factors such as economic perceptions, perceptions of issues and evaluations of political leaders. Some of the hypotheses about what drives party or candidate choice are also common in the literature on referendum voting, but in addition we need to focus on the campaign as a dynamic process after which final vote decisions are made. The paper addresses, with examples from national referendums in several EU-countries (Denmark, Netherlands and others), how referendum campaign effects can be conceptualized and how they can be investigated."
2007-1818,When the Alternative Goes Mainstream: The Competition Between Ethnic TV and the Internet in a Chinese Community of Los Angeles,Emerging Issues in Chinese Media,,,,Paper,When the Alternative Goes Mainstream: The Competition Between Ethnic TV and the Internet in a Chinese Community of Los Angeles,Emerging Issues in Chinese Media,"While much scholarly attention has been paid to the competition and convergence between mainstream media and the Internet, few investigate the extent to which the Internet intertwines with other alternative media, such as ethnic television, of which audiences have been rapidly increasing. This study selected a Chinese community in Los Angeles to investigate the audiences dependency relationships with ethnic TV and the Internet. The findings show that the fear that the Internet will replace ethnic television is not within sight as Internet connectors are less dependent on ethnic TV than non-Internet connectors. In two areas, however, the Internet may lure the ethnic television audience away from their couches. First, for those who rely mostly on television to obtain product purchase information, they are now likely to turn to the Internet to orient their buying behavior. Second, for those who depend mostly on television for relaxation purposes, they are now likely to turn to the Internet to have fun."

We find that, consistent with their counterparts in the United States, college women in Singapore reported a third-person perception when they were asked to evaluate possible effects of idealized body image portrayed in advertisements. The self-other difference of perceived media effect is moderated by factors like social distance between college women and comparison groups, college womens racial identity with advertising models, and college womens perception of the benefit likelihood of media influence."

While the circumstances under which journalists work have widely changed the conventions of news gathering, news presentation and news distribution, the prisms through which scholars consider journalism have not kept pace with the newer workplaces in which journalists labor. This paper tracks the implications of such a disconnect and argues for a wide-ranging effort to update journalism research and create greater consonance between journalism and its study."
2007-1821,"When Youre Here, Youre Family: Competing Authenticity Claims in Discourses of the Olive Garden Restaurant",Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,,,,Paper,"When Youre Here, Youre Family: Competing Authenticity Claims in Discourses of the Olive Garden Restaurant",Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,"This paper is an investigation into a specific cultural institution, the Olive Garden, and its relationship to issues of ethnicity and authenticity in a contemporary mediatized framework. Myriad cultural commentaries support a belief that the restaurant deserves nothing but contempt and disavowal; yet the restaurant continues to thrive. Part of the explanation for the divergent receptions and profound cultural anxiety that circulates in discourses about the Olive Garden, an anxiety that often evokes hostility and contempt is that the restaurant highlights the constructed nature of authenticity and its complicated relationship with issues of ethnicity. Moreover, the restaurant serves as a site over which competing authenticity claims are negotiated within contemporary consumer society. The cultural ambivalence and anxiety produced through the alleged authenticity of restaurants like the Olive Garden demonstrate the ways in which cultural distinctions and tastes are being renegotiated in contemporary consumer society.
I examine the ways in which the Olive Garden mobilizes a discourse of ethnic authenticity, while the discourses that condemn the Olive Garden and its ilk mobilize authenticity in seemingly incompatible ways. Because of the elusive nature of authenticity, different groups can make wildly divergent and seemingly incompatible authenticity claims. Rather than investigate those authenticity claims in order to assess which are the most valid, I question what is at stake in those claims of authenticity  especially those claims that produce strikingly strong reactions against the Olive Gardens claims of authenticity."

Impact of Display and Content Variables on Spatial Presence and Comprehension in Virtual Environments",formation Systems Interactive High-Density: Information Technology and Information Processing,,,,Extended Abstract,"""Where am I?"" Impact of Display and Content Variables on Spatial Presence and Comprehension in Virtual Environments",Information Systems Interactive High-Density: Information Technology and Information Processing,"Forgetting immediate physical reality and having awareness of ones location in the simulated world is critical to enjoyment and performance in virtual environments be it an interactive 3D game such as Quake or an online virtual 3d community space such as Second Life. Answer to the question ""where am I?"" at two levels, whether the locus is in the immediate real world as opposed to the virtual world and whether one is aware of the spatial co-ordinates of that locus, hold the key to any virtual 3D experience. While 3D environments, especially virtual environments and their impact on spatial comprehension has been studied in disciplines such as architecture, it is difficult to determine the relative contributions of specific attributes such as screen size or stereoscopy towards spatial comprehension since most of them treat the technology as monolith (box-centered). Using a variable-centered approach put forth by Nass and Mason (1990) which breaks down the technology into its component variables and their corresponding values as its theoretical basis, this paper looks at the contributions of five variables (Stereoscopy, screen size, field of view, level of realism and level of detail) common to most virtual environments on spatial comprehension and presence. The variable centered approach can be daunting as the increase in the number of variables can exponentially increase the number of conditions and resources required. We overcome this drawback posed by adoption of such a theoretical approach by the use of a fractional factorial design for the experiment. This study has completed the first wave of data collection and starting the next phase in January 2007 and expected to complete by February 2007. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed."

The Influence of News Coverage and Personal Issue Importance on Subsequent Information Selection on the Web,Knowledge & Information Processing,"With the growth of the Web, network television audiences and newspaper readership has declined. Many believe that both network television viewers and newspaper readership will continue to diminish. However, some researchers argue that the shift from traditional news consumption to the Web is at best, an exaggeration, and the Web appears to function more as a supplement to traditional news media. Little is known, however, how traditional news media usage influences Web usage patterns. This study investigates the process in which prior TV news exposure influences individuals subsequent Web use patterns in terms of selectivity by using a unique Web behavior record measuring Web viewing as it happens naturally. By testing three theories that may explain individuals information selection patternspriming, information utility and personal issue importancethis study offers a theoretical framework to explain individuals Web and traditional news use patterns. The results of the study exhibited the strong effects of persona issue importance on information selection on the Web regardless of news coverage. Overall findings of the study also showed higher levels of information selection with no prior exposure to news coverage supporting the information utility theory. Priming effects of news coverage on subsequent information selection on the Web, however, were not found. The implications of the findings were discussed."

Lifeline Awareness, Support, and Retention Among Low-Income Households",Broadband as the Basis for an Evolved Universal Service: The Benton Universal Service Project,"Even though the Lifeline and Link-Up programs in the U.S. provide low-income households with the opportunity to receive a ten-dollar subsidy on their local phone bills and up to thirty dollars to help establish service, the participation rates in these programs are suspect. Nationally, the FCC estimates about one-third of low-income households who meet the eligibility criteria for the Lifeline program actually participate. Furthermore, in states like Florida, it fewer than 15 percent of the more than 1 million households that qualify actually sign-up to receive a monthly discount. Although universal studies in the 1990s suggest high long distance and toll call charges and preferences to receive cable television are reasons why low-income households dont subscribe to wireline, previous studies do not specifically measure low-income households awareness concerning the Lifeline program and their perceptions on why qualified households do not enroll or continue to receive discounted telephone service."
2007-1825,"Which Audience, or The Audience of What?",Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,,,,Paper,"Which Audience, or The Audience of What?",Audience Studies: A Critical View from International Perspectives,"Audience studies' promise is alluring - to provide an understanding of a cultural product by inquiring into the meaning it has to its consumers. However, behind this seemingly simple premise lies the complex problem of what the cultural product or text in question is. Especially when contemporary networks of synergy and multi-platforming stretch texts out over various media, and when audiences' interactions with these networks can be so variable, it may therefore be problematic to ascertain precisely what the audience is an audience of, and hence where and when we should attempt to locate this audience. Similarly, when many ""audiences"" react to a text without watching it, which audience we are studying (fans, non-fans, or anti-fans) may bias our findings. This paper will argue for an increase of experimental audience studies projects that will find audiences before viewing, and during the consumption of multi-platformed extensions, synergy, and spinoffs."

These images often operate in a manner that essentializes race yet they simultaneously offer spaces to interrogate the fluidity of race. This paper analyzes hyper-racialized performances in films such as Malibus Most Wanted, White Boyz, and Be Cool in an attempt to understand why and how white appropriation of hip hop culture continues to provide a comedic element for popular culture, and documents how such representations reinforce racial partitions instead of acknowledging the diversity, hybridity, and complexity of race."

Building a Psychological Profile,Digital Inequality,"So, who are these power users and what makes them different from non-power users? Are they called power users because of their power to command industry attention to their evolved levels of technology use? Are power users the earliest adopters of technological innovations? Are they also the heaviest users? Or simply the ones who use most or all aspects of a technology? This paper explicates the concept of power usage among technology users by conducting a survey of 454 respondents in an international sample of technology users. Literature-based categorizations of the social and behavioral aspects of these users are contrasted with data-driven constructs in their ability to predict the volume of everyday use of simple and complex communication technologies. Our discussion focuses on implications for developing a power-users scale as well as its role as an important individual-difference variable with potential to moderate psychological effects of communication technologies."

The conflict episodes reported were coded based on 1) topical content of a conflict, 2) conflict strategy used by parents, 3) conflict strategy used by the young adults, 4) outcome of the conflict, and 5) reported consequences of the conflict to them or to their relationship. 4 general categories for topical conflicts were identified: life and educational decision, social and socializing behavior, moral or appropriate code of conducts, and parents behavior. The most frequently reported strategy selected by parents was distributive one, while the young adults most common choice was the avoidance strategy. Interestingly, the outcome of the conflict was a preferable to the parents in the current data set. In other words, parents are getting the final words. Lastly, although the many participants reported that the conflict experience was inconsequential, nearly half reported that it had a positive impact to them or their relationship with their parents."

An Investigation of the Newspaper's Perspective on Gay Marriage,"Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Interactive Paper Session","The current study investigated the approach of two national newspapers the New York Times and the Chicago Tribuneto cover the gay marriage issue. The study used the Massachusetts legitimization of gay marriage as a dividing point to explore what kinds of specific political or social topics related to gay marriage were highlighted in the newspapers. Additionally, this study examined how news sources were framed in the coverage of gay marriage, based upon the newspapers perspective and ideology. The results indicated that the New York Times was inclined to emphasize the topics of human rights and equality related to the legitimization of gay marriage. After the legitimization of gay marriage, the New York Times became an activist for gay marriage. Alternatively, the Chicago Tribune highlighted the importance of human morality associated with the gay marriage debates. The perspective of the Chicago Tribune was not dramatically influenced by the legitimization of gay marriage. It reported on the gay marriage in terms of American traditional value and family institution both before and after the gay marriage legitimization."

However, my paper argues that socialist media systems that were earlier insulated on purely political grounds against globalization encounter it in a different way from those countries in which globalization was never opposed for political reasons.

However, a nation to nation approach in comparative research is not enough, but new units for comparison must be found. This paper compares Chinese and Russian media to find out what are the similarities and differences between communist and post-communist media.

Emergency Management Directors,"Health, Risk, and Crisis Communication Education",,,,Paper,Who is Responsible for Local Emergency Preparedness? Formative Research With U. S. Emergency Management Directors,"Health, Risk, and Crisis Communication Education","Local emergency management directors in the United States have many responsibilities. Typically, these individuals have backgrounds in law enforcement but relatively little training in communication or public relations. Despite their backgrounds, their job descriptions often specify that they are also responsible for public education campaigns. For example, many emergency management directors are expected to persuade each inhabitant in their region to stock a household survival kit with a three-day supply of food, water, medicines, and a battery-powered radio. This paper reports a nationwide effort to interview county emergency managers, university safety officers, and Red Cross officials about their perceptions of the extent to which inhabitants in their communities have household emergency kits. Interviews gathered to date from 20 emergency officials show that they feel under-resourced and unable to have much impact on the preparedness efforts of members of the public, despite the fact they are charged with enhancing local preparedness. The long-term goal of this research effort is to find ways in which communication scholars can support their efforts by drawing from research in health, risk, and crisis communication and weaving analysis and implementation of emergency kits for everyone projects into graduate and undergraduate communication courses."

Exploring the Perceived Influence of Reality Shows and the Concern Over Their Social Effects,Exploring Perceived Media Influence,"This study explores the dynamics of social concern over reality shows. Couched in the theory of the influence of presumed influence, it is argued that the degree of concern over the effects of media mediates between beliefs in media power and people's responses to such beliefs. Survey data show that whereas there are large differences in the beliefs about effects on self and others, reports of self concern and perceived concern by others is similar. It was also found that concern is related to age, to beliefs in the social effects of reality shows, and to being critical of reality shows. Results are discussed in terms of their significance to understanding the process through which beliefs about media motivate social action."

Journalists' Debates About Coverage of the Nickel Mines School Shootings,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"Within hours of the October 2006 shootings of 10 girls in a one-room Amish schoolhouse in Nickel Mines, PA, this tiny town in rural Lancaster County was inundated with journalists from local, national, and international media. The subsequent debates about the role of the press in this case focused not only on media responsibility, but also on which kinds of media have the authority to report a culturally and geographically specific tragedy. Nearly all of that debate took place in print media, many of which claimed local or insider status in covering this story, and all of which positioned themselves as ethically superior to television journalists. Considering journalism as a discourse, this paper analyzes coverage in 20 American newspapers: 10 newspapers within 100 miles of the crime site, compared with the top-10 circulation U.S. newspapers. It finds that, while much commentary about the content of the coverage (as well as the purpose of journalism) appeared in the comparison group of nonlocal newspapers, the local papers contained the most, and harshest, criticism of the behavior of journalistsespecially big-city reporters and television news teams, who were marginalized as inept and uninformed as well as insensitive. In sum, press criticism of press coverage of the Amish school shooting created a basis for a challenge to the reportorial authority of mainstream journalism, while also illuminating the role of the press in articulating ideas about rural versus urban identity, and local versus national identity."

The Case of MTV's Sorority Life,Getting Real: Gendered TV Politics,"This paper is a work in progress that examines the reality show Sorority Life, about a group of young women pledging a Jewish sorority at the University of California, Davis. I watched all thirteen episodes on television, archived various online discussions of the characters and storyline, met with members of the sorority involved, and interviewed (either in person or over the phone) twelve of the participants, including several who played central roles. Taken together, these modes of inquiry provide a lens through which to examine the social and cultural dynamics of reality programming  particularly as understood from the perspective of actual character-participants, the group most neglected by scholars of the genre. I use the case of Sorority Life to explore the reasons why ordinary young women desire television exposure and to complicate the assumption often made by critics: that participants want one thing and one thing alone  media celebrity. I aim to explore what celebrity means in the reality-TV context and consider the gendered implications of conceptualizing the desire for media exposure as a mere politics of the self (Brenton and Cohen 2003), the ultimate expression of self-absorption."

These students are perceived to be somewhat different from American students, and they are expected to face many difficulties in the process of language learning and culture adaptation. This study investigates how to help international students to overcome their difficulties from professors perspective. Journalism and Mass Communication is the focus of the study since this major has a high demand for language proficiency. Nine Journalism and Mass Communication professors are interviewed. They comment on their prior teaching experience with international students. The interview data show that most international students are highly motivated and hard-working. However, they are relatively slow and inefficient in communication with their professors. The two major challenges for them are language difference and culture difference. To assist international students with their adaptation to a different education system, mutual understanding and trust-building seem to be very important for professors. In terms of grading, some professors tend to take the language issue into consideration, while others stick to one criterion. Finally, certain pitfalls in mutual communication between professors and international students should be avoided. Some general conclusions and suggestions based on the interview data are also provided."
2007-1839,Why Do High-Need-for-Cognition Audiences Prefer Complex Messages?: Explanation for Tailoring Effects,ghts Into Media Comprehension,,,,Paper,Why Do High-Need-for-Cognition Audiences Prefer Complex Messages?: Explanation for Tailoring Effects,Insights Into Media Comprehension,"Tailored communication provides information that is individualized to an audiences specific needs and interest based on assessment of individuals. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of tailoring or customizing message style based on audience personality type. It is expected that audiences with high need-for-cognition will respond more positively to advertising messages high in cognition value such as those containing visual metaphors. In support of this idea, results indicate interactions between message cognition value and audiences need for cognition on cognitive elaboration and source credibility. High need-for-cognition individuals were more likely than low need-for-cognition individuals to engage in greater cognitive elaboration and infer greater source credibility as message cognition value increased. The implications of these findings for message tailoring strategy in the new media environment are further discussed."

Explaining Film Import Choices of Individual Countries Among the Production Sources,From Importation to Independence in Film and Television Flows,,,,Paper,Why Do People Watch What They Watch? Explaining Film Import Choices of Individual Countries Among the Production Sources,From Importation to Independence in Film and Television Flows,"This study examines the theatrical film import choices of individual countries about nine countries as primary production sources, which are the US, Italy, France, UK, India, Russia, Germany, Japan, and Hong Kong. An empirical scheme is devised to explain the quantities of film imports by countries from the respective exporters, modeling determinants of cinema market scale, cultural distance, linguistic similarity, and geographic proximity. Based on a panel dataset (52 importers × 9 exporters) drawn from the UNESCO, the various regression analyses show that the frequency of film imports by a consuming country from an exporting country significantly increases in the exporters domestic cinema economy and decreases in the cultural distance between the traders. Also, the sharing of a common language intensifies the bicountry film flow, while locational adjacency does not seem to determine the film traffic level among the 9 exporters."

A Web survey was conducted to measure the demographics of bloggers, their motives for blogging, and the topic they cover on blogs. Seven motivations for blogging emerge in this research: self-documentation, improving writing, self-expression, medium appeal, information, passing time, and socialization. Except for passing time, all the other six motivations were highly approved by bloggers. Most of those motivations are moderately correlated. In terms of blog content, internal topics, which deliver bloggers experience and work, relationship with friends and family, and intimate feelings are the most popular among adult bloggers. External topics such as reflections and comments on politics, technology, and other public events are not as popular among adult bloggers as the impression constructed by mass media. Gender differences were located in blogging motivations and topic preferences. Men claim higher approval of information motivation while women endorse self-documentation, self-expression, and passing time more. Accordingly, men are more likely to blog about external topics while women prefer topics closely related to their life. Other than gender, age also plays a role in motivating people to blog. Motivations as self-documentation, self-expression, and passing time have a negative relationship with age. Educational level was found no connection with specific blogging motivations."
2007-1842,Why Internationalize Media Studies and How?,ternationalizing Media Studies,,,,Paper,Why Internationalize Media Studies and How?,Internationalizing Media Studies,"This paper will examine the imperatives for the internationalization of media studies. After reviewing the manner in which media studies as a subject has evolved in the UK and US, it will analyze how, in the global South, where the European colonial imprint is still deeply ingrained in intellectual institutions, media and communication research has been profoundly influenced by the Western, or more specifically the American tradition of Mass Communication research. This has evolved as a dependency relationship evident in the exports and imports of textbooks, journals, citations, employment of experts and the funding, planning and execution of research.

This approach privileged a type of research which provided useful data on the behaviour, attitudes and values of the people in the global South but largely failed to analyze the political, social and cultural contexts of communication. Arguing for an eclectic theoretical framework that draws from the best practices of both the critical as well as liberal traditions of Western scholarship, the paper proposes going beyond a 'de-westernizing' discourse to decolonizing the way research in and about the majority world is conceived and conducted. The economic growth of India and the peaceful rising of China  two ancient civilizations with huge potential to influence the emerging global knowledge society - are likely to affect the way media studies is theorized.

2007-1843,Why Public Health Needs Relationship Management,Measurement of Relationships in Public Relations,,,,Paper,Why Public Health Needs Relationship Management,Measurement of Relationships in Public Relations,"Relationship management can be applied in many settings, but perhaps no field would benefit more from the application of a relational approach to public relations than public health. Public health bodies such as state health departments can accomplish very little in isolation. Such bodies need to form lasting, productive relationships with public and private organizations to achieve their goals. Public health faces a set of challenges unlike any the field has encountered in decades including avian flu, the threat of bioterrorism, and insect-borne diseases such as West Nile virus. Unfortunately, the U.S. public health system may not be prepared to meet the challenges. This paper discusses the status of the U.S. public health system and offers suggestions as to how public relations practitioners working in public health settings can use relationship management to help meet organizational goals in this difficult public health environment."

This study examined the relationship between belief in mindreading and the type of grievance expression between romantic partners. Among a sample of undergraduate daters, belief in mindreading was positively related to the self-reported use of the silent treatment to transmit relational grievances. Belief in mindreading was also positively correlated with becoming increasingly upset if the partner fails to realize there is a problem and to report becoming verbally aggressive toward them. When angered by a partner, belief in mindreading was positively related to responding to a partners queries about whether there is a problem by stonewalling and admonishing the partner. Contrary to expectations, when angered, belief in mindreading was positively related to disclosing the problem to the partner. Study limitations and future research implications are discussed."

It tests the positivity bias idea that women are drawn to positive stimuli while avoiding negative ones while men approach negative stimuli more than positive ones. Men and women's affective and cognitive judgments of news messages in different valence frames (positive, negative and ambiguous) were measured. The 2 groups exhibited different patterns in their reaction to the news message conditions in line with the positivity bias hypothesis. Women reported more enjoyment and more favorable judgments of positively than negatively framed versions of stories. For men the reverse pattern emerged. Moreover, an interaction effect between subject gender and message valence not only demonstrates that women's favorability towards positive messages is stronger than men's, but also that their unfavorable views of negative versions of stories are stronger than men's."

It proposes that it will be more theoretically interesting and pragmatically meaningful if we can investigate how people vary their message designs as an influence task becomes more complex and difficult as apposed to those relatively simple tasks. Furthermore, we also need to examine whether there are factors interfering with peoples effective message design, thus degrading communicative performance (e.g., negative emotion). Indeed, it is just those difficult influence situations that bother people most in real life. In those important and difficult interpersonal influence situations, sometimes even though we are highly motivated to construct effective messages, we still fail to do it satisfyingly due to situational interfering effects (e.g., emotions ran high). Therefore, this paper proposes that by differentiating upward influence tasks (high- vs. low- personal relevance) and examining the role of cognitive elaboration mediating message production processes, we might have a new perspective to conceptualize the upward influence phenomenon."
2007-1847,Wikis and Widgets: Differences in Young Adults Uses of the Internet,Digital Inequality,,,,Paper,Wikis and Widgets: Differences in Young Adults Uses of the Internet,Digital Inequality,"The growing diffusion of new media raises questions about peoples ability to appropriate new technologies for their empowerment. While information technologies (IT) have become a staple of adolescents lives, we know very little about general trends in the use of specific types of services. We also have no information at an aggregate and generalizable level about how young people are incorporating IT into their everyday lives. This paper examines the relationship between the increasing spread of information technologies and social inequality. Based on original data about a diverse group of young adults Internet uses, the paper shows that even among members of the wired generation, considerable differences exist when it comes to everyday uses of the Internet. The paper ends with a discussion of what these findings imply for social inequality."
2007-1848,Willingness to Pay for Telephone Service in Peru,"New Media, Social Development, and Governance",,,,Paper,Willingness to Pay for Telephone Service in Peru,"New Media, Social Development, and Governance","The aim of this study is to identify significant factors influencing the adoption process of telephone service and the willingness to pay for telephone service in an under-developed country context. This study found that the willingness to pay for telephone service is not necessarily income-elastic. The result of this study partly negates the common stereotype that low income people are unwilling to pay for a communication service. Survey was conducted in peri-urban phoneless areas in Peru. This study used samples collected through multistage cluster probability sampling. Using hierarchical OLS models, this study examined the relative effect of SES, attitudinal, and behavioral factors in explaining variances in the willingness to pay for telephone service. This paper concludes with its implications for policymakers in developing countries in achieving the goal of universal telephone service and points out the needs for further research."

 This year, when McClatchy purchased the Knight Ridder chain, it immediately sold off a dozen of the least attractive properties at 12 times cash flow, a 25 percent premium to its purchase price. Media General sold 4 television properties in midsized markets are 15 times cash flow.
 In investing in quality news and emphasizing localism payoff. The large conglomerates and chains, who emphasized centralization, synergies and staff cuts, have been having trouble, while the smaller chains and stand alone entities that focus on specialized media businesses have been thriving.
 The evidence on conglomeration of television stations and newspapers (as opposed to convergence of digital and analog distribution) shows no clear pattern of economic or journalistic benefits.
 The problem facing traditional media is to develop models to distribute their content online and the solution does not involve consolidation of traditional outlets. The troubled chains have had the worst record in making the transition to online distribution."

Specifically, the study examines the role of perceived similarity and social attraction on self-disclosure and relational development drawing from Social Information Processing Theory, Social Penetration Theory, and Uncertainty Reduction Theory. Based on these theories, a model of relational development for Facebook users has been proposed and empirically tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). In addition, the study focuses on the relationship between relational commitment and network convergence as well as the relationship between the emotional support students receive from such relationships and their perceived stress levels. SEM was used to explain predictive paths between attitude homophily, social attraction, breadth and depth of self-disclosure, predictability, and interdependence with all hypotheses being supported. A regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between commitment and network convergence and also emotional support and perceived stress. Implications for computer-mediated relationship development are discussed."
2007-1851,"Women Are On, But Not In, the News: Gender Roles in Local Television News",Media Depictions and Identity,,,,Paper,"Women Are On, But Not In, the News: Gender Roles in Local Television News",Media Depictions and Identity,"Previous research has found differences in the assignment of news stories to male and female anchors and reporters, specifically that female reporters are assigned softer less substantive stories than are males. There is also some evidence that female experts are used as story sources less often than are males. This study examined 580 stories on the top three local television news programs in a Northeastern television market during a 2-week period. A content analysis was used to determine whether there were associations among gender of reporter and anchor and the type of story he or she was assigned. Content analysis of the three station newscasts revealed a significant association between gender of reporter and story selection, while there was no significant association between anchor gender and story selection. Female reporters were more likely to present human interest and health-related stories, while males were more likely to present political stories. Sources within the news that were interviewed by the reporter were also examined for gender differences. Male expert sources were used significantly more often than female experts. The analysis revealed no relationship between placement of the news story in the newscast and gender of the reporter and anchor."
2007-1852,"Women, Elections, and European News",Framing Europe in the News and in Public Opinion,,,,Paper,"Women, Elections, and European News",Framing Europe in the News and in Public Opinion,"Vallance and Davies conclude that ""Europe is good news for women (1986:114) after investigating the extent of female representation in the European Parliament. However, a gendered democratic deficit has been noted in public opinion on European integration: women are more likely to be eurosceptics than men. We explore this gender gap in the context of how EU news is framed. Specifically, we present findings from a European wide study of the visibility of women as candidates in European parliamentary elections, their presence in the news, and the relationship of these variables to the participation of women in elections, their attitudes about the EU and the representation of women in the European Parliament. The paper draws on content and survey data from 15 EU countries in 1999 and 25 EU countries in the 2004 European parliamentary election campaigns."

Image Analysis of Women in Magazines,,,,Work in Progress,Women Values and Stereotypes Created by Luxury Brands in Graphic Ads From 2002 to 2005,More Than a Pretty Picture? Image Analysis of Women in Magazines,"The main topic of the present research was the study of stereotypes and values created by luxury fashion brands in Spain. There are few academic studies about this subject because of the lower status that fashion advertising has in academia as a cultural manifestation found in mass media.
Advertisings principal aim is to build brand image and create a position in the market. Luxury brands, more than any other sector, provide a powerful symbolic value added to their goods. However, more than a mere market function, advertising has social and educative impacts.
A content analysis was performed of 290 graphic ads which relate to 97 luxury brands. The survey reveals five different womens stereotypes found in advertising images.
This article offers initial research conclusions supported by Observatorio Publicidad y Sociedad at Centro Universitario Villanueva (Universidad Complutense de Madrid)."

This study also explored what, if any, differences exist in the frames used for cervical cancer communication among magazines written for women of different races and ethnicities. Using the cultural theory approach as the underlying epistemology, a qualitative content analysis was used to learn how magazines read by African American, Hispanic, and white women provide a lens through which readers can understand cervical cancer. This study found five major frames used in womens popular magazines to report cervical cancer information: consciousness-raising, confusion in abnormality, controversy, innovation/medicalization, and differences across identities. The findings extended media framing theory as well as a developing theory of womens health communication into understanding better the gaps between womens understanding of cervical cancer and the ways the media position and write about cervical cancer in news stories. Practical implications include identifying news reporting gaps that can be filled by cervical cancer and sexual health communicators through increased collaboration with popular magazine journalists in the forming, contextualizing, sourcing, and detailing of their stories."
2007-1855,Writing for Friends and Family: The Interpersonal Nature of Blogs,Weblogs: Users and Their Motivations,,,,Paper,Writing for Friends and Family: The Interpersonal Nature of Blogs,Weblogs: Users and Their Motivations,"The goal of the current research is to explore antecedent variables related to the adoption of new technology for interpersonal goals. A random sample of bloggers were surveyed to explore how the combination of extraversion and self disclosure effect strong tie network size, which in turn serves as motivation to use new technology as an additional mode of communication. Bloggers who exhibit both extraversion and self disclosure traits tend to maintain larger strong tie social networks, and are more likely to appropriate blogs as an additional mode of communication to support these relationships. Age, gender and education have no relationship to network size, blog content, or the use of blogs as a relationship maintenance tool, suggesting that the social context surrounding technology use is a more effective approach to investigating user behavior. These results contribute to the continuing discussion regarding the impact the Internet and its tools are having on relationships by suggesting that, rather than promoting isolation, computer-mediated communication tools, like blogs, often function to enhance existing relationships."

A fan communitys dense, distant history creates a condition of neutralized textual meaning or ""neutrosemy,"" which escalates such struggles for meaning. Through analysis of Usenet commentary, this essay shows that Beatles cyberfans, as a prime example of this phenomenon, labor to shape the canon and mythology of this group, its music, and its cast of personae so as to privilege their favored subjectivities, thereby implicating hegemonic, gendered power relations of sexuality, sociality, and romance."

Validating a Measure for Assessing Individual Differences in Motivational Activation in Children,Information Systems: Advancing the Science of Information Processing Research,"This paper is a part of a line of research designed to develop a measures of individual differences in motivational activation. Previous research produced the Motivational Activation Measure, or MAM (Lang, Shin, Lee, 2005) based on dimensional emotion theories that conceptualize emotion as a function of activation in the motivational systems. This research has shown that MAM is reliable and valid when used to measure motivational activation in young adults (Lang, Bradley, Sparks, & Lee, in press) The goal of the present study is to validate a new measure called Youth Oriented MAM (YO-MAM) that will be suitable for children. Results of this study demonstrate that the appetitive activation measure, called positivity offset, and the aversive activation measure called negativity bias were significantly related to physiological, self-reported and behavioral measures of the appetitive and aversive systems respectively. Overall, the results of this study indicated that YO-MAM may be a valid measure of positivity offset and negativity bias for children."

The most pernicious effect of films rooted in these yellow peril discourses is, Wong contends, Hollywoods seemingly conscious unwillingness to learn about, and hopefully to know, the human and thematic area depicted (53). In this paper, we examine how the historical unwillingness to know the Asian other results in essentialized depictions of Asian identities that erase cultural and national specificities under a guise of authenticity. Specifically, we examine Memoirs of a Geisha and the controversy surrounding the cross-ethnic casting and international release in order to acknowledge that while some changes have been made in Hollywoods representation of Asians, the public controversy surrounding this film indicates some political and social problems of representation have yet to be adequately addressed by its appeal to authenticity."

The Effectiveness of Antidrinking and Driving Appeals",Normative Approaches to the Prevention of Alcohol-Related Problems in Youth,"2 studies investigated the effectiveness of legal consequence messages to reduce drinking and driving. The first study was an experimental study that tested five types of antidrinking and driving messages and a control message, and found that overall the legal consequences message was least effective. The legal consequences message generated the most counterarguments, was perceived as biased, led to higher estimates of descriptive norms of drinking and driving and lowered intentions to use a designated driver in the future. The second study reported portions of focus group conversations with young drivers in which they discussed their experiences with drinking and driving crashes and in which they described the inconsistency with which they believe police enforce drinking and driving laws."

Open-ended questions were followed by forced-choice assessments. 77 percent of the children reported on a specific instance of media-induced fright; most were responding to movies, fare that they had not chosen to view. Frequent symptoms included being unable to stop thinking about it, a variety of sleep disturbances, and apprehension about engaging in otherwise nonthreatening activities. Forty percent reported that the effects were continuing. More than half regretted seeing the show, and sixty percent said they would warn other children about it. Most children coped with their fear by themselves. Many of the observed age and gender differences were consistent with previous research. A comparison of open- vs. closed-end answers provided new insights into developmental differences in coping strategies."

Focusing on Americas Next Top Model (UPN) it shows how tropes of femininity (e.g., to be looked at-ness) are enlisted but significantly reworked by television competitions that train workers (as contestants and as TV viewers) to conceptualize themselves not as workers, but as self-enterprising commodities. Drawing from the cultural theories of Valerie Walkerdine, Paul du Gay and others, the paper argues that ANTW glamorizes corporate neoliberal economics and job insecurity, while also promising to provide dispositions and skills to enable female workers to thrive as entrepreneurialized, self-branded agents within this environment. This research complements studies of televisions commercialism by showing how commodification works at the subjective level."

Following this theoretical approach, this study defines virtual community as a social construction created by people who gathered on the Internet and form social relationships based on a variety of goals, practices and experiences. This study investigates the community formation in Second Life-a massive multiplayer online game with 3-dimensional interface. As its advertising slogan stated Your World, Your Imagination, Second Life is a 3-D virtual world which is a digital creation mostly of its players. It is a marketplace currently supports millions of U.S. dollars in monthly transactions; also a socializing space for people all over the world. Studying a complex social congregation within a 3-D visual interface and mostly player created content, this study can provide illustrative explanations about how community form through its participants practice and minds, thus to extend our knowledge in the social outcome of multi-media online communication. Focusing on peoples in-game practice and experience, this study uses textual analysis to examine player-run newspapers and blogs. The finding suggests that Second Life is a community in which 1) social aggregations are based on a sense of virtual geographical belonging; 2) players different view of Second Life and real life racial identities are applied as symbolic resources that form communities."
