2006-0001,2004 Presidential Campaign Messages: A Functional Analysis of News Releases from President Bush and Senator Kerry,"Public Relations, Governmental, and Political Campaigning",Public Relations,,,Paper,2004 Presidential Campaign Messages: A Functional Analysis of News Releases from President Bush and Senator Kerry,"Public Relations, Governmental, and Political Campaigning","This study content analyzed news releases from Bush and Kerry in the 2004 election. Challenger Kerry attacked more and acclaimed less than the incumbent, Bush. Defenses were relatively rare. Candidates focused most on policy than character or campaign-related topics. When addressing policy, they discussed past deeds (53.3%), future plans (16.9%), and general goals (29.8%). When discussing character, they addressed personal qualities (57%), ideals (27.1%), and leadership ability (15.9%). Results were compared with Bushs and Kerrys 2004 television spots, debates, and 2004 primary campaign news releases."

Analysis is conducted in a blended approach applying chaos theory, stakeholder theory, and two-way symmetry as combination approaches in dealing with and explicating a large-scale crisis. Chaos theory has been applied to the 1997 Red River Valley flood in Minnesota and North Dakota (Sellnow, Seeger & Ulmer, 2002), however, there are no specific cases that explore a blended approach to crisis on a large scalea cosmological crisis."
2006-0003,A Brave New World for International News? Exploring the Determinants of the Coverage of Foreign Nations on U.S. Web Sites,Old to New Media,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,A Brave New World for International News? Exploring the Determinants of the Coverage of Foreign Nations on U.S. Web Sites,Old to New Media,"This study content analyzed international news published on two of the most visited Web sites in the United States, cnn.com and www.nytimes.com. The influences of trade, existence of news agencies, national traits, and cultural and geographic proximity on these two news Web sites were examined. The international news from the online version were analyzed and compared with the print and broadcast versions. The study found that trade volume and existence of news agencies are two leading predictors of international news coverage in both online and traditional media. Yet, the influence of news agencies on the Web sites seems greater than on the traditional media. Also, press freedom was found irrelevant to international coverage in the U.S. media."
2006-0004,"Abstract Inclusion-Concrete Exclusion: ICTs, EU Policies And Aspects Of Digital Divide",National Regulation in an International World,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,"Abstract Inclusion-Concrete Exclusion: ICTs, EU Policies And Aspects Of Digital Divide",National Regulation in an International World,"During the 1990s, both scholarly and media discourses have been celebratory of the Internet in general. As Wolcott and Cagiltay (2001: 133) suggest, the Internet has appeared as a powerful force for integrating local economies into the global economy, an engine for economic growth, a force for freedom, a threat to revenue streams of telecommunications providers and their governments, a facilitator of terrorist activities, and a corruptor of social values. A global, neo-liberal policy agenda was popularized by the Clinton-Gore administration in 1993 through their proposal for the establishment of a Global Information Infrastructure (GII) and Global Information Society (GIS), which overlapped with both the GATS and the US own National Information Infrastructure (NII). The aim of this paper is to, first, briefly reflect on the policy and academic discourse on information infrastructure and digital divide in terms of the implications of the ways these concepts were regarded; secondly, to analyze the current situation in Turkey, a candidate to the EU, concerning access to the ICTs and factors affecting the digital divide; and thirdly, to discuss the vision offered by government-level IST policies and international events such as WSIS."
2006-0005,"Abu Ghraib Revisited: News Narratives, Visual Culture, and the Power of Photography",Narrative Structures of the News,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,"Abu Ghraib Revisited: News Narratives, Visual Culture, and the Power of Photography",Narrative Structures of the News,"Drawing on a close analysis of how the Abu Ghraib photographs originally were framed in the American news media, public debate and in popular cultural contexts, this paper addresses the question of how news media images exert power in the shaping of news, politics, and public opinion. Specifically, it takes issue with the scholarly tendency to foreclose any inquiry into the workings of news media images with presuppositions that such images mainly play the passive role of illustrations to dominant news frames and official political discourse, with little or no potential for independent influence on members of the audience. The paper argues instead that the relationship between visuals and news narratives not seldom is a high-tension one, and that images which contradict or disrupt a dominant discursive frame might have a considerable impact, if not directly on politics and policy making, then more so on popular imagination and historical consciousness. Even if the Abu Ghraib photographs in a short-term perspective had minimal political or policy repercussions, they nevertheless dealt a fatal blow to the United States mission in Iraq. Not only were these photographs bound to alienate much of the Arab world, but also, in a long-term perspective, to percolate into the mind of Americans, and to create their own autonomous frame of reference in the sense that the heretofore banned sight of American soldiers in the role of sadistic dominators has become an integral part of our understanding of the US war on terror."
2006-0006,A Burkean Theory of Media Effects: Toward a Non-Salience Theory of Framing,New Perspectives on Priming and Framing,Political Communication,,,Paper,A Burkean Theory of Media Effects: Toward a Non-Salience Theory of Framing,New Perspectives on Priming and Framing,"Since its inception, agenda setting research has been grounded in psychological theories which posit the role of salience in the formation of opinions. Media effects are explained through the medias ability to report certain issues rather than others, thereby enabling or disabling individuals from recalling particular aspects of a public controversy. This paper argues that such a psychological model can not explain observed media effects for issues that are already of high salience, i.e. the ability of the media to move public opinion on issues that are already broadly discussed and highly relevant. Instead, this paper will offer an alternative theory for media framing grounded in the psychological and rhetorical theories of Kenneth Burke. Specifically, it will be argued that Burkes pentad and his description of how pentadic ratios can affect perceptions offers an alternative methodology for investigating media effects."
2006-0007,A Case Study of Government PR Practices in Korea: An Application of Huttons PR Model,Public Relations High Density Session: Young Talent,Public Relations,,,Poster,A Case Study of Government PR Practices in Korea: An Application of Huttons PR Model,Public Relations High Density Session: Young Talent,"The public relations (PR) practices of the Korean Information Service (KOIS) and the National Image Committee (NIC), two major PR organizations in the Korean government, are analyzed in this study. Based on the three-dimensional theoretical framework of Huttons 1 public relations practices (interest, initiative, and image), the PR practices of the KOIS and the NIC were classified into six relatively distinct orientations or models of public relations practice: persuasion, advocacy, public information, cause-related public relations, image/reputation management, and relationship management. Using data collected from in-depth interviews and investigation into the actual PR materials, both the KOIS and the NIC are found to rely heavily on image/reputation management type PR practices. On the other hand, the relatively weak practices of the two organizations are found to be advocacy and cause-related public relations. The primary contribution of this study is providing PR practitioners of government organizations with theoretical understanding and applications of public relations practices, which complement the development of strategic PR programs. Limitations and future research are discussed."
2006-0008,Access to Information as a Human Right: Analysis of the United Nations Human Rights Committee,A Human Rights Approach to Access to Information,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,Access to Information as a Human Right: Analysis of the United Nations Human Rights Committee,A Human Rights Approach to Access to Information,"This paper assesses the status of the right of access to government-held information in international human rights law by analyzing the documents of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Many international NGOs and some legal scholars envision access to government information as a human right. Most positing this idea base their arguments on the wording of articles 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR, which includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information. After analyzing approximately 850 decisions, 183 country reports, and 34 statements of the Committee, this paper found that the Committees interpretations of Article 19 do not clearly envision access to government-held information as a human right. Limited situation-specific rights were found under Covenant articles guaranteeing rights of privacy and the right to a fair trial."
2006-0009,"Accounting for the 1920 Lynching in Duluth, Minnesota: Marginalizing People, Groups, and Ideas in Selected Minnesota Newspapers (Top Interactive Paper)",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Paper Session,Ethnicity and Race in Communication,,,Paper,"Accounting for the 1920 Lynching in Duluth, Minnesota: Marginalizing People, Groups, and Ideas in Selected Minnesota Newspapers (Top Interactive Paper)",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Paper Session,"For decades, Minnesota history books omitted the story of how a white crowd numbering in the thousands lynched three Southern black men in one of the states largest cities. This research about how Minnesota newspaper coverage of this one eventthat in some ways epitomized, and in other ways was an anathema to, much that marked American culture in 1920constructed the account, and in the process shaped perceptions of responsibility for the lynching and perceptions of marginalized groups, people, and ideas. In the analysis of fifteen mainstream daily newspapers and two African American weeklies, research for this case study shows how dominant voices reinforced dominant presentations of responsibility for the lynching, presentations that reinforced dominant social structures. Additionally, it presents how black and white womens, and black mens, voices were absent or rare, as well as addresses information and ideas not reported or slighted and how medias construction of the lynching contributed to hegemony."

2006-0011,A Comparative Analysis of the Framing of Conflict in Cancer News: Mobilizing African Americans to Better Health,From Health Campaigns to Media Preferences: Understanding the Role of Ethnicity and Race in Communication Processes,Ethnicity and Race in Communication,,,Extended Abstract,A Comparative Analysis of the Framing of Conflict in Cancer News: Mobilizing African Americans to Better Health,From Health Campaigns to Media Preferences: Understanding the Role of Ethnicity and Race in Communication Processes,African Americans suffer disproportionately from cancer in the U.S. One way to reduce health disparities is to increase awareness and motivate preventative behaviors. Contingency theory of conflict management suggests that conflict can motivate action. This study compares one year of cancer stories in 12 U.S. mainstream newspapers and 24 Black newspapers. The purpose is to contrast how the newspapers present conflict factors: comparative group risks and causes of cancer. Our results will help identify if Black newspapers present conflictual information differently. These findings may reveal important cultural factors for communicating with African Americans about cancer.
2006-0012,A Comparative Content Analysis of Wartime News Sources: CNN and Al-Jazeera,News Contents in International Perspective,Mass Communication,,,Paper,A Comparative Content Analysis of Wartime News Sources: CNN and Al-Jazeera,News Contents in International Perspective,"Given the recent repercussions of Arab network Al-Jazeeras wartime prominence, this study conducted a comparative content analysis of CNN in the Gulf War and Al-Jazeera in the Iraq War presented in The New York Times to examine their uses as news sources, their assessments, and evaluation of U.S. public relations efforts. The present study predicted that CNN would be used and evaluated more favorably by The New York Times. The results of the content analysis mostly supported the predictions. Implications of our findings and suggestions for future research were stated."
2006-0013,A Comparative Study of Employee/Superior Communication Style between Finnish & Mexican Employees,"Organizational Communication Interactive Paper Session: Focus on Leadership, Socialization and Interpersonal Relations in Organizations",Organizational Communication,,,Paper,A Comparative Study of Employee/Superior Communication Style between Finnish & Mexican Employees,"Organizational Communication Interactive Paper Session: Focus on Leadership, Socialization and Interpersonal Relations in Organizations","The purpose of this international research is threefold: First, to discover and compare the communication styles of Finish and Mexican employees when they communicate with superiors. Second, to explain the impact that gender, organizational, and national cultures have on communication style. Finally, to analyze the theoretical and practical implications of the findings in terms of the communication competencies needed for successful communication between employees and superiors.

The samples used for this research were collected in Finland and Mexico. The following statistical procedures, using SPSS program, were conducted: Means, Standards Deviations for each item and dimension. T-tests were conducted to compare Finish and Mexican employees and male/female communication styles.

One of the major general conclusions of this study is the confirmation of the theoretical position of the authors on how a post hoc cultural explanation of communication behaviors is legitimate and valid way of theorizing on how communication is influenced by culture and therefore, how it can be understood and explained from a culture perspective.

Another major theoretical conclusion drawn from this study is that every culture has its own communication style. The findings clearly demonstrate that the way Finish employees communicate with their superiors is different from the Mexican employees. For example, there are clear differences in terms on how Finish and Mexican cultures view and manage conflict. In Finnish culture to confront conflict is no only appropriate but also encouraged as necessary. On the contrary in the Mexican culture the norm is to avoid it."
2006-0014,A Comparison of Dialogue and Focus Group Procedures for Influencing Publics Views Toward Controversial Science,fluence in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,A Comparison of Dialogue and Focus Group Procedures for Influencing Publics Views Toward Controversial Science,Influence in Interpersonal Relationships,"The purpose of the paper is to examine the ways in which individuals attitudes change or remain stable as a result of discussing controversial science issues in groups. Specifically, we report a study in which members of the public engaged in dialogue with scientists about human biotechnology, or HBTand in which we examined the effects of these experiences on participants attitudes. In contrast to an earlier study on discussion of HBT within focus groups, we found that participating in dialogue groups had a strong and significant positive effect on participants general attitudes toward HBT science and scientists. Similarly to the focus group study, participants reported increased communicative self-efficacy after the group experience. Implications for practice and research are discussed."
2006-0015,A Comparison of Election News Coverage in Sweden and the United States,Election Coverage around the World,Political Communication,,,Paper,A Comparison of Election News Coverage in Sweden and the United States,Election Coverage around the World,"This study compared the news coverage of election campaigns in two Swedish and two U.S. newspapers. Based on framing theory, the results from the content analysis show that the strategic game metaframe was used more frequently by the U.S. newspapers while the issue metaframe was more common for the Swedish newspapers. U.S. articles were also more likely to use the horse race and political strategy frames. While U.S. coverage was predominantly descriptive in focus, Swedish coverage offered more analysis and interpretation of the election campaign."
2006-0016,A Comparison of Self-Categorization and Spiral of Silence Explanations for Speaking Out (Top Three Paper),How We Use Categorization to Understand Behavior,Intergroup Communication,,,Paper,A Comparison of Self-Categorization and Spiral of Silence Explanations for Speaking Out (Top Three Paper),How We Use Categorization to Understand Behavior,"Self-Categorization and spiral of silence predictions for speaking out are compared. Student participants (N = 60) indicated their levels of fear of isolation and the degree to which they considered themselves prototypical of their university before being presented with a high or low threat inducement (a proposed campus ban on alcohol consumption). A three way interaction was found on both perceived threat and willingness to speak out. For participants low on fear of isolation, those low on prototypicality were more willing to speak out under the high than low threat inducement. For participants high on fear of isolation, those low on prototypicality were more willing to speak out under the high than low threat inducement. Highly prototypical group members were high in willingness to speak out independent of fear of isolation and threat. Perceived threat mediated the effect of prototypicality on willingness to speak out. It is concluded that the findings are most consistent with self-categorization theory."
2006-0017,A Content Analysis of Social Groups in Primetime Spanish-Language Television,Media and Culture,Mass Communication,,,Paper,A Content Analysis of Social Groups in Primetime Spanish-Language Television,Media and Culture,"The audience for Spanish-language television has been increasing at a rapid pace. Indeed, Univision frequently outranks at least one of the major U.S. networks among young adult viewers and captures more Latino audience members than any of the major U.S. networks. However, little is known about the type of depictions a viewer is likely to encounter on Spanish-language TV. As such, the present study assesses the frequency and nature of representations of age, class, and gender in the 2004 primetime, Spanish-language television season. The implications of social identity theory were applied as a framework for understanding the potential influence of exposure to these images on Latino audience members."
2006-0018,A Couple of White Guys Sittin Round Talkin: Representations of Masculinity and Commodification in Frasier,Popular Communication and Gender,Popular Communication,,,Paper,A Couple of White Guys Sittin Round Talkin: Representations of Masculinity and Commodification in Frasier,Popular Communication and Gender,"A transition in the portrayal of masculinity on television can be examined within the context of the new man, an idea that emerged in 1970s as a reaction to feminist and other social movements. The television image of the new man was one that embraced and fostered emotional relationships with men and women. The leading male characters on the situation comedy Frasier are examples of the new man paradigm. Frasier is progressive in many ways with its portrayal of the new man, yet problematic in other ways. The paper examines Frasier with a focus on how the image of the new man is portrayed and parodied in the program. As it will be discussed, the symbolic construction of the new man on Frasier is connected to ideologies of consumerism and conspicuous consumption of white-collar viewers."
2006-0019,A Critical Interrogation of Cultural Globalization and Hybridity: Considering Chinese Martial Arts Films as an Example,Communications Globalization and Hybridity,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,A Critical Interrogation of Cultural Globalization and Hybridity: Considering Chinese Martial Arts Films as an Example,Communications Globalization and Hybridity,"Contemporary social and cultural theories contain polarized ideas on whether culture is becoming increasingly homogeneous or heterogeneous under the scenario of globalization. Among the approaches supporting heterogeneity, hybridity is a crucial and appealing theory. Hybridity results from the mixing of phenomena that are held to be different and separate. It is used in defining todays globalization, particularly cultural and media globalization. However, because of its postmodern and deconstructionist qualities, the concept of hybridity is not stable and not easily incorporated into politics and policy-making, and is sometimes accused of becoming a theoretical tool to rationalize modernity, global capitalism and global consumerism.
This paper questions the fundamental assumptions of the concept of media hybridity: that media hybridity displays diversity, democracy, localism and interdependence; and I hope to reconstruct a critical notion of hybridity. I investigate these assumptions about hybridity by researching the production strategies and content of media hybridity. I analyze the five market strategies for producing media hybridity, including transculturation, cultural appropriation, re-localization, de-localization, and High Concept, and I compare the content of three main types of media hybridity seen in contemporary martial arts films as compared with traditional martial arts films, to see the influence of media hybridity. Investigating the real face and influence of media hybridity is quite crucial because it can helps us better understand the actual process by which globalization happens and understand how other/global cultures enter our/local lives and then become part of our/local culture."
2006-0020,A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Communication Patterns and Conflict Between Young Adults and Parents,Generation and Age Differences in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural & Development Communication,,Intercultural Communication,Paper,A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Communication Patterns and Conflict Between Young Adults and Parents,Generation and Age Differences in Intercultural Communication,"Young adults in Japan (N = 124) and in the United States (N = 136) completed surveys including Ritchie & Fitzpatricks (1990) revised family communication patterns instrument as well as the Rahims (1983) conflict styles scale modified for the family setting. A cross-cultural comparison revealed that diverging distributions of family types in the two different countries. The consensual family type was most common in the United States, while laissez-faire family type was most common in Japan. We found significant between group differences among all four family types on the likelihood to use five conflict strategies. The consensual family was associated with the young adults selection of the integrative strategy in dealing with conflict with parents. Young adults in the protective family indicated use of the avoidance strategy than those in other family types, while the pluralistic family was most strongly associated with the competitive strategy. Possible explanations based on the two dimensions of family communication patterns as well as cultural variabilities are provided."
2006-0021,A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Perceptions and Uses of Mobile Telephony,The Mobile Phone: Negotiation of Meanings in Public Places across Cultures,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Perceptions and Uses of Mobile Telephony,The Mobile Phone: Negotiation of Meanings in Public Places across Cultures,"Drawing from the theoretical orientation of Apparatgeist (Katz and Aakhus, 2002), this study explored cultural similarities and differences in perceptions and uses of mobile telephony. A sample of college students from Japan, Sweden, Taiwan, Hawaii, and the U.S. Mainland were surveyed to assess (1) perceptions of the mobile phone as fashion, (2) attitudes about mobile phone use in public settings, (3) use of the mobile phone for safety/security, (4) use of the mobile phone for instrumental purposes, and (5) use of the mobile phone for expressive purposes. Results indicate some differences and several similarities among the cultural groupings and help lay the groundwork for future research and theory building."
2006-0022,"A Cross-National and Double-Sided Test of Spiral of Silence Theory: Culture, Governmental Form & Personality",Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,Political Communication,,,Paper,"A Cross-National and Double-Sided Test of Spiral of Silence Theory: Culture, Governmental Form & Personality",Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,"The past Spiral of Silence studies investigated people's outspokenness mostly on micro level, failing to integrate into a single model three crucial independent variables-culture, governmental form, and personality. Their measurement of dependent variable had the theoretical flaw that only considers the respondent's reaction when in the minority but missed the situation when in the majority. Furthermore, the past Spiral of Silence studies did not distinguish the conformity pressures in a unanimous opinion environment from those in a non-unanimous one, nor solve the cross-national comparability problem on the topic issue selection. This study refines the conceptualization of Spiral of Silence and designs a new measurement considering the respondent's reactions both when in the minority and when in the majority, distinguishes unanimous and non-unanimous environments, introducing an an unspecified controversial issue to solve the cross-national comparability problem, and integrates culture, governmental form, and personality into the research model by using a cross-national and multi-level comparison method."
2006-0023,A Cross-National Examination of Third-Person Perception About Ideal Body Image,Advances in Effects Research I,Mass Communication,,,Paper,A Cross-National Examination of Third-Person Perception About Ideal Body Image,Advances in Effects Research I,"This study compares third-person effects about body image for Caucasian women in U.S. and for Chinese women in Singapore. We find that college women in both the U.S. and Singapore tend to perceive greater media effects of ideal body images in magazine ads on their peers than on themselves. The race of the media models and the race of college women does not affect the college womens perceptions of media effects on themselves or on their peers. Only individual differences such as ones self-evaluation or self-esteem moderate the magnitude of third-person perception. Our analyses also shows that a persons perception of the media content and their perception of the benefit likelihood of media influence are two distinct concepts, each related to the magnitude of third-person perception."
2006-0024,A Cultural Approach to the Study of Mediated Citizenship,Political Communication Top Faculty Papers,Political Communication,,,Paper,A Cultural Approach to the Study of Mediated Citizenship,Political Communication Top Faculty Papers,"The study of media and politics is dominated by three central but flawed assumptions: that news is the primary and proper sphere of political communication; that the most important function of media is to supply citizens with information; and that political engagement must necessarily be associated with physical activity. These assumptions are based on an instrumental orientation toward media. This article advances, instead, a cultural approach to the study of mediated citizenship, one that foregrounds the intimate role that media play in the daily lives of citizens. It argues four primary propositions: that people employ a complex ensemble of media that have extensive reach into our lives as citizens and consumers; that communication mediums have differential effects on the meanings that come to constitute political reality; that we must look beyond information acquisition as the primary reason for how and why citizens employ political media, and instead see the integrative aspects of media usage; and that we exist in a culture of mediated engagement with politics that structures our political lives in unprecedented ways. Together, these propositions suggest that scholars need to account for the central role of mediated politicsin all its manifestations and formsin the constitution of citizens understanding of the state and their relationship to it."
2006-0025,Acupuncture in the United States: Uses and Implications for a Holistic Speech Code,"Otherness and Similitude: Construction, Adjustment, and Conciliation",Language & Social Interaction,,,Paper,Acupuncture in the United States: Uses and Implications for a Holistic Speech Code,"Otherness and Similitude: Construction, Adjustment, and Conciliation","Acupuncture is a 3000 year old health care system that within the last 40 years has received quite a bit of scholarly and popular attention in the United States. Simultaneously, in the last 40 years, the dominant biomedical tradition in the U.S. has been critiqued while alternative holistic health models have emerged. This article is based on fieldwork conducted in Seattle, Washington in a small acupuncture clinic and in a variety of other acupuncture classes and settings. Using an ethnography of communication perspective, I present a holistic speech code and argue that it is used as a translational device for presenting acupuncture to new clients. Given the current health situation, the holism of acupuncture makes sense and is easily accepted. However, because holism is often depicted as biomedicines alternative, a holistic speech code also works to create sometimes unrealistic practitioner-client relationships. The holistic speech code and the social realities implicated in the use of this code work to construct a unique form of American acupuncture."
2006-0026,A Discursive Approach to Cognitive Dissonance: Making Sense of Socio-Political Change in Northern Ireland,Performing Identities,Language & Social Interaction,,,Extended Abstract,A Discursive Approach to Cognitive Dissonance: Making Sense of Socio-Political Change in Northern Ireland,Performing Identities,"Context

Northern Ireland (NI) is traditionally polarised along ethno-religious/political lines. However, it was hoped that devolution and a pioneering peace process would increase cultural plurality and integration. This does not appear to have happened. Indeed, some research suggests that community divisions have intensified during the peace process (e.g. Shirlow, 2005).

Aims/Approach

We examine one aspect of this process within a discursive framework. Specifically, we consider cognitive dissonance management, from a rhetorical and interactional perspective (Billig, 1996, Neuman&Tabak, 2003), in order to understand everyday sense-making in post-devolution NI. Within this socio-political context, traditional stances/identifications are continually challenged. We examine how such processes are negotiated at the micro-level of talk/interaction, and, specifically, how cognitive dissonance is managed such that habitual alignments are bolstered/maintained.

Data/Discussion

The data are drawn from Protestant/unionist and Catholic/nationalist group discussions of devolution in NI. We focus on one particularly contentious topic; the reformed police service of NI. In reconfiguring this issue, the participants utilise various discursive strategies to establish consistency with their traditional community stance(s). In so doing, they reinterpret, but ultimately reaffirm, existing community divisions, within the devolved context. We discuss (a) how cognitive dissonance is managed in real-life interaction, and (b) how this process relates to wider societal and political contexts in NI.

2006-0027,"Adolescent Movie Preferences, Mental Health, and Temperament",Examining Individual Responses to Information Processing,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,"Adolescent Movie Preferences, Mental Health, and Temperament",Examining Individual Responses to Information Processing,"A secondary analysis of data from a large-scale intervention study was used to evaluate associations between movie preferences and mental health and temperament measures obtained from middle school students. Preliminary findings suggest that preference for rated R movies and preference for violent movies relates to issues surrounding rule-breaking behavior, defiance, and self-regulation. Preference for sexuality in movies marginally related to attention issues. The findings provide initial evidence for examining media preferences in light of consistent behavioral patterns and mental health states, in addition to more traditional mood management investigations."
2006-0028,Adolescents' Exposure to Online Sexually Explicit Material and Recreational Attitudes Towards Sex,The Uses and Effects of Media among Adolescents,Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,Adolescents' Exposure to Online Sexually Explicit Material and Recreational Attitudes Towards Sex,The Uses and Effects of Media among Adolescents,"Previous research has largely ignored the implications of adolescents exposure to online sexually explicit material for their sexual attitude formation. To study whether adolescents exposure to sexually explicit material on the internet is related to recreational attitudes towards sex, we conducted a representative online survey among 472 Dutch adolescents aged 13-18. In line with an Orientation 1  Stimulus  Orientation 2  Response (O1-S-O2-R) model, we found a pattern of multiple mediated relationships. Male adolescents (O1) used online sexually explicit material (S) more than female adolescents, which led to a greater perceived realism of such material (O2). Perceived realism (O2), in turn, mediated the relationship between exposure to online sexually explicit material (S) and recreational attitudes towards sex (R). Exposure to online sexually explicit material, then, is related to more recreational attitudes towards sex, but this relationship is determined by adolescents gender and the extent to which they perceive online sexually material as realistic."

The extant literature on peer influence and selection in smoking behavior of adolescents is reviewed and hypotheses are advanced in accord with the network theories of evolution and homophily. Findings suggest that the proportion of in-degree and out-degree to intending smokers both uniquely predict adolescent smoking behavior, even when prior smoking is controlled."
2006-0030,Adolescents Perceptions of Canadian Cigarette Package Warning Labels: Investigating the Effects of Message Framing.,Message Framing in Antismoking Campaigns,Health Communication,,,Paper,Adolescents Perceptions of Canadian Cigarette Package Warning Labels: Investigating the Effects of Message Framing.,Message Framing in Antismoking Campaigns,"Two hundred ten high school students participated in an experiment examining the effects of graphic warning messages on cigarette packages. Adolescents were randomly assigned to one of three message framing conditions (i.e., loss-framed, gain-framed avoidance, and gain-framed benefits), and then completed a questionnaire measuring attitudes, perceptions of health risks, perceived effectiveness of the warning labels, and behavioral intentions. Results indicate that adolescents had more favorable attitudes toward the loss-framed warnings, and perceived them as being more effective than the gain-framed warnings. Further, underage smokers exposed to the loss-framed version featuring decaying teeth were significantly less likely to have intentions to smoke in the future. These results indicate that loss-framed warning labels can motivate adolescent smokers to quit, and can reinforce behavioral intentions among non-smokers. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for health communication researchers and practitioners are discussed."

Doing the ""Right Thing"" in PR When Organizations Misstep",Public Relations Advocacy and Activism,Public Relations,,,Paper,"Advocate, Exit, or Something Else? Doing the ""Right Thing"" in PR When Organizations Misstep",Public Relations Advocacy and Activism,"This study draws from PR role theory, professional ethics, and Hirschmans (1970) theory of dissidence to examine dissent practices in public relations. As part of a larger online survey, 707 practitioners responded to the question, ""What does it mean to do the right thing in public relations when management is making decisions that you believe are inappropriate?""
Respondents overwhelmingly embraced the use of advocacy for changing inappropriate decisions. However, respondent answers varied according to the extent of advocacy, the selection of advocacy strategies, and the influence of loyalty and other factors on their decision making. Seven types of public relations advocates were identified. The research contributes to a thin literature on dissent in PR and supports the importance of managerial advocacy in excellent public relations practice."
2006-0032,A Dynamic and Integrated Model of Motivations of Media Use and Media Effects in Political Communication,Rethinking Media Use and Media Effects,Political Communication,,,Paper,A Dynamic and Integrated Model of Motivations of Media Use and Media Effects in Political Communication,Rethinking Media Use and Media Effects,"The current research paradigm on media effects is characterized by conditional models of media effects which assign an influential role to mass media in how people perceive the (social) world, while also emphasizing an active audience whose members can select media and their content, direct their attention to specific parts of the information and are co-creating the media effect as much as it is induced by mere exposure itself.
This paper focuses on the role of motivations of media usage in the emergence of media effects, but also outlines an approach for developing a more comprehensive understanding of media effects. The proposed model is based on three approaches to motivations in media effects research: the uses and gratifications research tradition, the cognitive mediation model, and (dynamic-)transactional approaches to media effects. Four different roles for motivations are identified: causes of selection of media content, causes of media effects mediated by cognitive information-processing, moderators of the impact of media content on recipients, and motivations as direct and indirect effects of media exposure. The different approaches and roles of motivations are then integrated into a dynamic model of media effects with reciprocal implications for the motivations. The purpose of the model is to enhance the theoretical understanding of motivations and their relationship to media effects as well as outlining empirical approaches to studying these processes. In addition, the model is a start to develop a more integrative understanding of media effects."
2006-0033,Aesthetics of Oriental Communication,Global Public Discourse,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Aesthetics of Oriental Communication,Global Public Discourse,"Although communication thought is only one of many thought, it is, in fact, a root of every thought. Western and Orientals dissimilar communicative aspects branch out in divergent thoughts. Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism which represent oriental thought have distrust and skepticism in language as media. For example, in the first chapter of ｢Taodejing｣, which is a collection of Taoism thoughts, it says, The way that can be spoken of is not the constant way; the name that can be named is not the constant name which argues against the idea of perfection of language. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that oriental aspects doubt the efficiency of any media that communicate in language.

On the other hand, Western civilization believes in words and media that communicate in language which resulted strong faith in the idea that words could replace any objective. This phenomenon is supported by the binary system; binary system only considers certainty and objectiveness as the effective communication.

The different perspectives in language in Oriental and Western civilization raise the questions for the cause and these phenomena only could be explained by the different use of communicative technologies by both civilizations. Although the media technology made a quiet improvement that it is incomparable with the media in the past, it reveals more significant difficulties in communication. This article explains why Oriental communication ideologies are the best solutions to current crisis in the media."

A features analytic method is utilized to assess how the individual television program web pages on these network sites are designed and evaluates the extent to which they integrate various media forms. In this regard, a five item coding scheme is proposed, to draw comparisons in the degree of convergence across network sites. This inquiry also has value in finding out whether vertical integration among networks and studios plays a role in determining how extensively convergence is utilized on these sites."

Findings reveal two umbrella categories for how  as Partners in the Game and as those who Stand by Their Friends  and one general for why  because its fun. Varying levels of participation for how women play include Screamers, Smilers, Blankers and Detachers as well as Loyalists, Traitors and Absentee subdivisions for female gamers. Gender analysis and indirect effects theory suggest yet another public sphere for male dominance in society. Additional research in the areas of direct and indirect medium effects as well as gender studies is called for."

Based on the I-PEFiC model (Van Vugt, et al., 2005), we assumed that both an engagement and an interaction process contribute in explaining user experiences with interface characters. In a 2*2 between-subjects design, we varied Aesthetics (beautiful vs. ugly, as engagement factors) and Affordances (help vs. obstacle, as interaction factors) of interface
characters in the Sims2-game. Results generally supported our hypotheses that aesthetics and affordances interacted to predict user engagement and use intentions. Furthermore, both engagement and interaction processes contributed to end-user satisfaction. Engagement and interaction processes appeared to be interdependent, pointing at the usefulness of a transdisciplinary approach to computer-mediated communication and human-computer interaction."

Through the inclusion or omission of facts and images, news stories and advertisments frame a health issue by promoting a particular definition, interpretation, and/or recommendation. This study investigated the frames found in the health news stories within three major newspapers in the South Eastern United States (1 English and 2 Spanish). Risk, medical management, faith, economic and social frames identified in a comparative content analysis revealed a significant difference in the medical management, social and economic frames found in English and Spanish health news stories. No significant differences were found for the frames in advertisements."
2006-0038,After the Tears: Native American and African American Identity in Oklahomas Territorial contact zones,tercultural Contact Zones and Post-Colonial Communication Studies,Ethnicity and Race in Communication,,,Works in Progress,After the Tears: Native American and African American Identity in Oklahomas Territorial contact zones,Intercultural Contact Zones and Post-Colonial Communication Studies,"An eclectic assortment of Indian and Black newspapers, published during the decades after the removal of the Five Civilized Tribes into Indian Territory, flourished in varying degrees until Oklahoma achieved statehood in 1907. A re-examination of the remarkable shared, yet distinct, experiences of these diasporic communities within their historic migrations to Oklahoma offers layered insight into the complex dynamics of racial resettlements. This paper calls for a new recognition of these ethnic newspapers, largely excluded from traditional research, that mark the turbulent histories of both black and red peoples in Oklahoma.
With official language and inked signatures, the 1830 Indian Removal Act precipitated the forced removal of beleaguered Native Americans from Eastern settlements of the emergent United States, to uncertain territories west of the Mississippi. Included within the estimated 60,000 deportees (Bartl, 1995, 167) were thousands of men and women of African descent, slaves whose own futures were doubly compromised by their Indian masters and white oppression. In concert, the diasporic experiences of Native Americans and African Americans made indelible marks upon the cultural histories of a state, Oklahoma, and of a nation. An eclectic assortment of Indian and Black newspapers, published shortly after the removal until Oklahoma statehood in 1907, offer great potential for understanding the evolution of outcasts into distinctive cultural communities. Drawing upon diaspora and contact zone theories, this study suggests a framework for understanding the shifting social contexts of these cultural diaspora."

We accomplish this task by first collecting and analyzing interview data to produce a 58-category system of ICT influences. We then use that set of findings to drive a computer simulation of ICTs in the Garbage Can. The simulation output shows that solution promoters, a key feature of the Garbage Can, have the strongest effect on the simulated organization."
2006-0052,Ageism in the Media: An Analysis of Discourse on Middle Age in Newspapers,Framing and Blaming,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Ageism in the Media: An Analysis of Discourse on Middle Age in Newspapers,Framing and Blaming,"A content analysis of major U. S. newspapers was undertaken to assess how the discourse on middle age and midlife was framed, with attention to whether that discourse was consistent with the concept of ageism. It was posited that ageist messages may be seminally situated in middle age rather than solely relating to senior citizens or the elderly.
Frequency comparisons of the frames used in presenting discourse on middle age revealed that crisis/change, health/medical, and social/psychological frames were presented the most often. In terms of content emphasis, however, the frames of policy, social/psychological, and population influence appeared the strongest.
The tone of discourse on middle age showed an ideology of decline consistent with ageism: 48% of articles had an overall negative tone about middle age or the experience of aging, while only 30% were positive. Likewise, discourse consistent with ageism was indicated by the higher frequency of negative attributes of aging mentioned in articles (75%) compared to positive attributes of aging (59%).
Ageist messages in major U. S. major newspapers may affect middle-aged persons identity formation and perceptions of the social reality of aging."
2006-0053,Agenda Building via Issue Advocacy: Stakeholder Perceptions and Public Information Processing,Public Relations Advocacy and Activism,Public Relations,,,Paper,Agenda Building via Issue Advocacy: Stakeholder Perceptions and Public Information Processing,Public Relations Advocacy and Activism,"Issue advocacy campaigns have the potential to raise public awareness of certain issues by providing information at reduced cost or effort to the person receiving the information, thereby influencing the publics agenda. This study evaluated this relationship empirically, examining whether the issues promulgated by an advocacy campaign are more salient with the general public, a process known as agenda building. Additionally, the study examined whether an agenda-building influence among the general public is related to greater approval for the advocated industry since image building and industry approval are identified as fundamental goals of issue advocacy campaigns. The study found support for both relationships, even when controlling for high levels of environmental concern. Based on results of a multiple regression analysis, it seems that messages relating to community identity have the greatest impact on garnering approval for an advocated industry, particularly those using emotional appeals to highlight a resource communitys sense of tradition and heritage. The study used survey data evaluating community stakeholder perceptions of a marketplace advocacy campaign by the coal industry designed to generate support for public policies associated with coal mining."

However, as we argue, by grafting agenda-setting and media systems dependency theory  two different traditions in mass communication theory  it is possible to better account for changes in the agenda-setting process due to shifts in the power relationships between all actors involved, especially under conditions of increased threat; conditions similar to those the American public has lived in since the September 11 terrorist attacks. Illustrations from Campaign 2004 complement our analysis. We suggest that it is critical to understand the dynamics of the making of mediated realities, so as to alert readers of the importance in furthering critical media literacy skills necessary for the public to distinguish between facades and facts."

In all three cases, constitution occurs in a pattern that we call the structurational hermeneutic, and involves speech-act functions that we call conlocutions. Then we show how the four flows each contribute to constitution, analyzing their distinctiveness as communication and their structuration of power dynamics in the organization."

In this paper we study the relationship between the social context of acquaintance (school, neighborhood and online) and friends social similarity and the quality of the relationship. We rely on the proximity- similarity hypothesis argueing that friendship homophily results from organized social activities. The current study investigates friendship similarity and its effect on the strength of ties among dyads. Using a sample of Israeli adolescents (n=980), age, gender and residential similarities were studied . The findings show that when a friend was met at school, the likelihood of similarity according to age, gender and place of residence is higher comparing to a friend met in the residential locality or online. Age and gender similarity are not related to the strength of ties, but friends that were met in the same locality are closer than the ones living in another city. Friends that were met in the neighborhood and school are usually closer friends than friends that were met online. However, social similarity matters even for friends that were met online. The more similar an online friend in terms of residence and gender is, the stronger is the social tie. The results imply that proximity and similarity still matter, even for a global medium of communication such as the Internet."

In particular, how should it report its own course of action during and after the crisis? These questions proved to be especially pressing in the case of Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak in 2003. The Hong Kong government chose to provide the public with daily reports that highlighted the scientific basis of its every step towards a reasonable solution to the crisis. However, in addition to receiving scientifically circumspect information, the public also urgently needed action on the part of the government that could generate stories of bold leadership, bravery in the face of adversity, and heroic accomplishments along the way to the final triumph over SARS. Such narratives were not forthcoming from Hong Kongs official public narrators. Accordingly, this essay examines the governments public pronouncements during the SARS crisis and finds that they failed to provide effective hero narratives to unite the people and stimulate their fighting spirit during the epidemic."

Content analysis of all the HIV/AIDS news stories in Peoples Daily between 2000 and 2004 indicated that the coverage of HIV/AIDS steadily increased. World AIDS Day affected the media agenda by boosting AIDS coverage. The primary sources of HIV/AIDS news stories were from government, foreign and domestic experts, and international organizations and conferences. The coverage of HIV/AIDS sped up greatly when Chinese leaders stood out and made public speeches in combating AIDS. The United Nations was one of the key drivers in putting HIV/AIDS issues onto Chinas media agenda. Additionally, the framing of HIV/AIDS stories emphasized disease prevention and promoting HIV/AIDS education and awareness in the country. Regarding the coverage with regional perspectives within China, Northern China and Central China were two areas that have been emphasized. HIV/AIDS was no longer framed as a problem only existing outside China given that nearly 60 percent of stories had a China-only perspective. The Chinese government and the media have been facing the economic, social, political or medical problems caused by HIV/AIDS within the country in a more honest and frank manner."

Because diffusion occurs through time, this study looks at the impact of time and national indicators on initial Internet adoption and its adoption change rate using a longitudinal design. Six explanatory models were proposed to examine initial adoption of the Internet and adoption change rate. The results affirmed that initial Intent adoption is higher in developed countries, but as the time goes, the change rate of adoption decreases more in developed countries than in developing ones. The findings imply that improvements in telecommunication infrastructure can cumulatively bridge the global digital divide among nations incrementally across time."

The findings mostly confirms our hypothesis."

In a nationally representative telephone survey (N = 1501), young people (ages 14 to 22) reported their habits for 12 different uses of mass media as well as awareness of current national politics and time spent in civic activities. Following Putnams hypothesis about the beneficial effects of civic ties on political involvement, we predicted and found that civic activity is positively associated with political awareness. Contrary to Putnam, we found that media use, whether news or entertainment related, facilitates civic engagement, while news media are especially effective in promoting political awareness. Although heavy use of media interferes with both political and civic engagement, the overall effect of media use is favorable for each outcome. The results are discussed in regard to the potentially greater use of the media to build community engagement in young people."
2006-0063,A Model of High-Performance Suggestion Systems,Organizational Impacts on Employee Voice,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,A Model of High-Performance Suggestion Systems,Organizational Impacts on Employee Voice,"This paper focuses on one of the available tools to promote employee participation, namely suggestion systems. Suggestion systems are formal communication channels between employees and management. If well implemented, suggestion systems can serve important functions within an organization and impact the organizations bottom line.
The paper outlines and tests a model of high-performance suggestion systems by building and expanding on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991). According to the theoretical model, employee participation in suggestion systems is explained and predicted by TPBs antecedents. At the same time, the relationship between TPBs antecedents and a broad range of organizational characteristics--such as adequacy of the suggestion systems rewards, organizational trust, empowerment, supervisory support to the process of continuous improvement, and role breadth self-efficacy--has been explicitly considered.
The model was empirically tested by administering a questionnaire to line workers in an automotive plant (Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky Inc.). Overall, the results provided support to the proposed model with 35% of the explained variance in future participation in suggestion systems, 65% of explained variance in intention to submit suggestions, 41% of explained variance in attitudes toward submitting suggestions, and 24% of explained variance in self-identity with submitting suggestions."
2006-0064,A Multilevel Study of Antecedents and a Mediator of Employee-Organization Relationships,Measuring Relationships in Public Relations,Public Relations,,,Paper,A Multilevel Study of Antecedents and a Mediator of Employee-Organization Relationships,Measuring Relationships in Public Relations,"One research direction that is needed but has not been fully exploited in studies of organization-public relationships is research on the antecedents of relationships. The antecedents of relationships are the first stage of the relationship framework, for they are what cause specific relationships between an organization and its publics to develop. The purpose of this study was to explore possible antecedents of internal relationships in organizations. The researchers examined the direct and indirect influences of organizational structure and internal communication on employee-organization relationships using organizational justice as a mediating factor. Organizational justice is a relatively recently developed but widely used concept in organizational studies that refers to the extent to which people perceive organizational events as being fair.

This study was a typical example of multilevel research in that it gathered and summarized individual-level data to operationalize organizational-level constructs such as organizational structure and internal communication. The multilevel nature of the main constructs of this study was addressed by using the multilevel analysis method.

The findings suggested that organizational structure and the system of internal communication were associated with employee-organization relationships, playing the role of antecedents of internal relationships. Organizational justice mediated the effects of symmetrical communication and organizational structure on communal relationships and four relationship outcomes (control mutuality, trust, commitment, and satisfaction), implying that symmetrical communication and organic structure can contribute to building quality relationships when they are combined with fair behavior by management."
2006-0065,Analyzing Women Networking for Empowerment: A Methodology Perspective,Women's Work: Networking and Empowerment,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,Analyzing Women Networking for Empowerment: A Methodology Perspective,Women's Work: Networking and Empowerment,"The Internet as a space to analyze peoples interaction is an idea which is receiving increasing interest from social theorists around the world. Some authors within the futuristic approach to information technologies support the argument that the Internet could help citizens revitalise democracy, as it represents an open space for discussion and people interaction. However, a tension exists to this approach as the history of the design, development and use of the Internet is heavily male dominated and therefore female are excluded. Whilst implicit in the nature of democracy is the idea of equality and sharing between the genders, the feminist discourse has underlined the nature of the Internet as dominated by a technological elite made up of men. From this perspective, it is important to analyse gender involvement in use and development of technologies in general, and Internet in particular and the appropriation of the web by women networks.
This paper investigates the theoretical bases of empowerment, appropriation, identity in relation to the use of the web, and compares these ideas with empirical analysis of the real use of the Internet by groups of women in five different geographical areas: Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, and Australia. A number of websites from these areas were selected and a structural and formal analysis was performed to compare their use, design, community service, promotion of womens activism, and new forms of interactive communication."

In this argument the question of certainty is examined in three contexts; certainty as it is argued in narrative and mythological settings, certainty as negotiated in the connotations of words, and certainty as a struggle at the level of definition. This argument suggests that an analysis of certainty will produce insights into the way hyperreality supports a culture of certainty."

In particular, research has examined the ability of children to understand the techniques that advertisers use to specifically appeal to children in food commercials, and has often concluded that children do not understand or are misled these techniques. The present study is a content analysis of the food ads in one week of childrens programming on both cable and broadcast channels. In sum, 2,334 advertised were analyzed for narrative themes, audio-visual techniques, the presence of rewards for purchasing the product, and product attributes. Notably, the promise of mood change as a result of the product was present in approximately 37% of the ads, 59% used popularity and friendship as part of the plot, 54% mentioned taste, 53% contained humor, 55% feature well-known characters or celebrities, and 57% used a mixed format of live-action scenes and animation. It is suggested that the advertising techniques that advertisers use are those that they believe to be the most effective, based on the amount of documented research that they conduct. It is also suggested that the techniques that children see the most often have the most potential for impact. Therefore, suggestions for future research are made in order to assess the strength and type of this impact based on the appeal methods most frequently utilized."

A one-credit oral discourse course, designed as the intervention in a pre-experimental design, underscored the importance of collective political participation and attempted to strengthen the skills needed to engage in populist democratic politics. These included the communication skills of negotiation, compromise and persuasion. Findings from pre and post semester questionnaires indicate the course had limited effects on traditional measures of students internal and external political efficacy. Yet they also reveal improvements in assessments of social trust, the perceived effectiveness of collective political acts and the projected likelihood of participating in political activities."

We find that violence-prone movie genres (such as action, adventure, science fiction and horror) have markedly increased in prevalence among the top 20 U.S. box office movies over the 1967-2004 period, while benign genres (such as drama and musicals) have markedly declined. Using movie industry databases, we find strong tendency for the rising genres to be technology-friendly, (i.e., to make relatively intensive use of special effects and related production technologies) and for falling genres to be non-technology intensive. We interpret the results to support the theory that Hollywood has shifted its production resources toward more violent-prone genres because advances in production technology have made those movies relatively more attractive to audiences and/or more cost effective to produce."

The objective is to contribute to discourse among researchers and practitioners concerning the role of communication capital in constructing successful organizations.

A review of the literature indicates that communication capital is related to networking, and that personal factor, prior knowledge, knowing and communicating combine to raise the levels of alertness and increase the likelihood of new venture creation in organizations. The present article seeks to advance theoretical knowledge about communication capital by synthesizing research into a conceptual framework that may explain the processes of networking as a critical asset in the economic activities of organizations. The thesis of this paper is that communication capital is an entrepreneurial competency grounded in networking embedded and embodied in various environments and interdependent with the creation of new ventures. The construct of communication capital is largely based upon communication and networking perspectives and emphasizes (1) human potential grounded in knowledge and knowing (2) communicating actors, and (3) human-environment-networking."
2006-0073,A New Generation of Global Corporate Social Responsibility,Corporate Social Responsibility: A Global Perspective,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,A New Generation of Global Corporate Social Responsibility,Corporate Social Responsibility: A Global Perspective,"Despite the ubiquitous acknowledgement of globalization in virtually all areas of social, political, and economic life, conceptualizations and discussions of ethical and responsible organizing within the academic, policy making, and local communities, often remain remarkably parochial. In this paper, we reconsider corporate social responsibility (CSR) within a global framework, particularly focusing on its evolution and impact over time. We explore how a global perspective enables us to see the ways in which the development of the CSR movement mirrors (as well as builds upon) the evolution of the global human rights regime. Like the development of international human rights standards and norms, which, we suggest, are integral to corporate global social responsibility, there are several generations of CSR that continue to explore how to construct and enact more humane and ethical organizational practices. The first generation of CSR is grounded in discussions of responsibilities regarding what NOT to do (e.g., negative responsibilities such as NOT to exploit, cheat, etc.). The second generation focuses upon discussions of providing adequate compensation and working conditions (e.g., the right to a living wage), and the third generation, addresses proactive and positive responsibilities (e.g., to protect and create a sustainable and just world). Taken together these generations provide a framework for exploring the evolving nature of CSR, as well as the theoretical and pragmatic challenges of developing standards and norms for global corporate engagement."
2006-0074,A New Look at Framing Research--Examining the Framing Effect as a Mechanism in Behavior Motivation,Public Relations and Framing,Public Relations,,,Paper,A New Look at Framing Research--Examining the Framing Effect as a Mechanism in Behavior Motivation,Public Relations and Framing,"This study provides an alternative approach to study framing effect. The author argues that the lack of consistent findings in whether framing at a macro level has an impact on individuals interpretations/judgments at the micro level suggests that there is a mechanism, which is resonance, that researchers might be neglecting within the framing process. Using an experimental design, the study demonstrates that resonance serves as a crucial linking variable when scrutinizing framing from a cross-level of analyses perspective. The implication of how such a finding contributes to advancing framing theory and future research directions are discussed."

Specifically, individuals' perceptions of others' use of these messages during conflict was investigated. Additionally, trait verbal aggressiveness and its influence on the perception of others' aggressive message use is examined. Survey data from three hundred participants was used in the analysis of this study resulting in two major findings. First, individuals reported more verbally aggressive messages in conflict episodes with strangers as opposed to those with family members or coworkers. Second, trait verbal aggressiveness was found to be significant for some messages in the family and organizational settings but not in the stranger context. These findings are discussed and future direction is suggested."
2006-0076,An Examination of the Characteristics of Technology Opinion Leaders and Opinion Seekers,Human Computer Interaction and Information Processing,Information Systems,,,Paper,An Examination of the Characteristics of Technology Opinion Leaders and Opinion Seekers,Human Computer Interaction and Information Processing,"Researchers in various disciplines have focused almost exclusively on opinion leaders, while opinion seeking has received almost no theoretical attention. In addition, no research exists which focuses on the characteristics of technology opinion leaders and opinion seekers. The current research explores the characteristics of technology opinion leaders and technology opinion seekers. It also demonstrates the existence of an influence bias which has overestimated the differences between opinion leaders and opinion seekers in prior diffusion research. The current study demonstrates that opinion leaders and seekers are more similar than different. Except for technological innovativeness, willingness to publicly individuate, and media use, technology opinion leaders and seekers were similar in most of the variables thought to discriminate them in prior research."

Data was obtained from a survey participated by 265 respondents with Chinese origin but currently residing in Australia. Results indicated that among the three indicators of social location, age appeared to be a strong positive predictor of the dependency on ethnic newspapers for information. Respondents who stayed longer in the host country tended to be more frequent readers of ethnic newspapers as well. Education did not appear as a significant predictor of ethnic newspaper dependency. These findings suggested the need for us to further investigate the impact of ethnic print media on ethnic minorities in the age of various information sources offered by new technologies."

Findings suggest that increased media coverage on political figures not only influences on public salience but also creates more dispersed attitude toward them. In addition, multiple regression analyses show that while news exposure and variables representing cognitive ability such as education and political knowledge are more important in forming salience, attention to news and variables concerning motivational constructs are related to attitude formation in agreement with media coverage. The implications of the findings are also discussed."

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to integrate the concepts of relational outcomes and reputation in a single model. Survey research was used to collect data, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to empirically test the causal relations between variables of interest. In the causal model, relational outcomes are hypothesized to predict reputation, taking into account the exogenous influences of publics communication behaviors, personal experience, and familiarity with the organizations studied. The proposed structural equation model had tenable data-model fits across all organizations studied, supporting most of the hypotheses proposed in the study. More specifically, the research produced the following important results. First, this study found a significant, positive effect of relational outcomes on organizational reputation for all organizations studied. Second, the results of this study demonstrated the relevance of the proposed antecedents of relational outcomes and reputation. Third, the study found a stronger effect of communication behaviors on relational outcomes than the effect of familiarity. Limitations and suggestions for the future research were discussed."

In total, seven waves were conducted. We found that the most important determinants of the intention to quit smoking were: quitting identity, self-efficacy, talking with others about smoking cessation, time interval since the last unsuccessful attempt, and attitude towards quitting. With respect to smoking cessation behavior, we discerned between successful cessation attempts and unsuccessful cessation attempts. Overall, we found that social influence variables stimulate smoking cessation attempts, but these attempts have a tendency to fail. On the other hand, if a smoker has a high level of self-efficacy and has a positive attitude towards quitting, a cessation attempt is more likely to be successful. Only quitting identity, a variable that has hardly been studied before, influenced both successful and unsuccessful cessation attempts."
2006-0081,An Intercultural Analysis of Imagined Interactions,"Culture, Face Concerns, and Apologies",Intercultural & Development Communication,,Intercultural Communication,Paper,An Intercultural Analysis of Imagined Interactions,"Culture, Face Concerns, and Apologies","ABSTRACT
This study examines imagined interactions (IIs) among young adults in the USA, Thailand, and Japan. A comparison of means across cultures on II characteristics reveals that the Japanese participants have the widest variety of imagined interaction partners, while the American participants are the most self-dominant in their imagined interactions and demonstrate the most II frequency. The Thai participants report the most positively valenced imagined interactions, and the least II self-dominance and partner variety. As for II functions, Japanese and Thai participants keep conflict alive via their imagined interactions more than the Americans. The Japanese participants utilize all four II functions more than the Thais and Americans, while the Thai participants use imagined interaction rehearsal the least."
2006-0082,An International Study of Ethical Roles and Counsel in the Public Relations Function,Ethics in Public Relations,Public Relations,,,Paper,An International Study of Ethical Roles and Counsel in the Public Relations Function,Ethics in Public Relations,"Academics and practitioners often call upon public relations to be the corporate conscience of an organization. Public relations professionals know the tug-of-war that exists between being expected to defend an organizations ethics and being part of an ethically questionable profession themselves. To better examine these challenges, an international research project employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. This project found that many public relations practitioners perform two distinct roles relating to ethics: the conscience counselor role and the core values manager role. Whereas the practice of organizational conscience may emphasize process, the continuous development of core values centers on content. Faced with performing these roles, practitioners reported they are rarely trained for these activities either academically or by employers but many had worked for years to earn the ability to advise the dominant coalition on ethics. More than one participant reflected on how the pace of the relationship is glacial. Public relations professionals, themselves being seen as having questionable ethics, must work long and hard to educate the dominant coalition about the contributions public relations can make to ethical decision making. The relationships between organizations and publics, as well as the value of the public relations function could be enhanced through both academic study and professional ethics training for public relations managers performing the roles of conscience counselor and values manager."

A Dialectic Analysis of Ghost in the Shell,From Asia to the World: Globalization within and through Popular Communication,Popular Communication,,,Paper,An Old Ghost or a New Shell? A Dialectic Analysis of Ghost in the Shell,From Asia to the World: Globalization within and through Popular Communication,"Since the 1990s, a cycle of Japanese anime films has been released to western markets, many of which have proven very successful. Oshii Mamorus SF anime Ghost in the Shell is no exception. Since its release in 1995, it has either been acclaimed as an original and revolutionary breakthrough or denounced as too philosophical and obscure for a commercial film. This paper looks at Ghost in the Shell as a critical engagement with feminist media criticism, cyborg theories, and philosophy that deals with body. Through the examination of this film, I argue that this film owns a subversive new shell of postmodernism in its depiction of an unconventional female protagonist, the inverted sexual/power roles, and the extinction of the humans uniqueness in a post-human world; on the other hand, though, this film also befriends a conventional old ghost in the sense of the ways of representing female characters, the stress on the females maternal function of reproduction, and the reiteration of the minds agency over body. These result in the conclusion that Ghost in the Shell and many other successful anime innovatively present ideological norms sanctioned by cultures in the form of an open text, which might account for animes international popularity."

Consistent with Mayer et al.s (1995) distinction between the factors that contribute to trust, trust itself, and the outcomes of trust, this study sheds light on factors that are crucial for creating a trusting atmosphere. The findings contribute to the existing literature on trust by: (a) establishing that trustworthiness, communication, context, and organizational support are trust antecedents; (b) showing that the overall levels of trust in the immediate organizational context influence trust; (c) pointing to specific aspects of communication necessary for trust to arise; and (d) addressing the importance of organizational support. The study was conducted in a large metropolitan area in the U.S. according to the principles and methods of grounded theory."

This paper addresses its effects on consumer behavior. Given the domination of U.S. products in movie markets worldwide and the important role of movies in the preservation and promotion of local cultures, the research focuses specifically on the relationship between anti-American sentiment and American movie consumption. Cross-sectional survey data of movie consumption collected in France during the political and diplomatic row over the Iraq war support the proposition that animosity toward the U.S. significantly affects American movie consumption. Implications for global U.S. businesses are addressed."

Research hypotheses and interventions were developed from integration of the Framework of 40 developmental assets (Scales & Leffert, 1999) and Fishbeins Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (Fishbein, 2000). The experimental field study (intervention and post-test) was conducted with 1,265 Thai youth in mid-adolescence and 241 parents/caregivers to examine the campaigns influences on social cognitive factors, behavioral intentions, and behavior in relation to asset building. Interventions included two mini-magazines titled PYD (one targeting youth vs. one targeting parents) that focused on building developmental assets among test subjects. Findings reveal complementary, short-term, but mixed, effects of two media campaigns on Thai youths positive outcomes."

The analysis results reveal that the online communication among the forum users did not statistically vary between months in terms of the level of communication (density). During one of the time periods, however, there was a higher number of message relations among those who already posted messages to one another. The analysis also shows that few mentors were central to the online communication; that is, they happened to connect any two teachers who had no direct message relation. Finally, relevant multilevel and multi-theoretical future research directions are discussed."

Yet, when we look back for theoretical inspiration as we puzzle over another new technology, we find only nuggets of insight. The lack of conceptual residue from a prolonged period of hectic research activity gives reason for pause. On reflection it seems that we often get caught in a cycle where soon after we have made some sense of and described a new technology yet another one appears on the horizon and drawn by its newness we move our attention. In this paper we revisit the voluminous literature on videotex, a technology that had captured the imagination of researchers not too long ago, and map out this cycle and then suggest strategies for breaking out of it."

Expanding and Shifting Functions of Family Photography on the Web,Boundaries and Transgressions in Visual Discourse,"Private web sites represent one of the more interesting areas of research of cultural change and reproduction. They also compellingly demonstrate the complex role of technology in those cultural processes. As a contemporary exponent of the long established tradition of family photography this practice follows the path of the analogue photograph, framed and displayed at the home, kept in wallets or presented as series of pictures or photo albums, with a marked move to the digital world and a much less noticed shift to the sophisticated multimedia context of the Web. This article examines how this fairly recent move of private photography to the semi-public space of the Internet, reinforced, expanded or radically changed the nature of family communications and the very significant social and cultural functions this highly codified practice fulfilled from the onset. Also some attention is paid to the methodological aspects and implications of researching these new and very vivid exponents of (visual) culture."

Are All Opinion Givers Opinion Leaders?: A Clarification of Constructs Based on Empirical Data.,Interpersonal Communication in Groups,"Opinion leaders are a prime target group for any company. Studies on consumer behaviour support the importance of personal sources of information and influence. Still, careful attention should be given to methods of identifying these individuals.
We assess existing methods to identify opinion leaders. In particular, we address the question whether the most prominent construct, the King/Summers scale, is able to reliably and validly identify those individuals that perform as opinion givers.
On the basis of a survey of 10100 respondents on money matters, we test this concept of opinion leadership. We show that without the benefit of ego-centred network analysis any study runs the risk of misjudging the importance of individuals identified as opinion leaders. We suggest a combination of network size and opinion leadership, arriving at a role differentiation of four groups. With this, we draft a communication model for active opinion leaders, communicators, silent experts and inactives."

This paper also could be viewed as a literature review of work outlining and defining the norms and routines of the profession. A key contribution to be made here is that reporters routine practices are not just related to the norms; these practices are designed to uphold and achieve these norms. Two norms of competition and minor cooperation are proposed as additions to the traditional list of journalistic norms with specific routines designed to uphold them

With an increase in the reliance on new technologies, research has documented a variety of ways in which people appropriate overlearned social behaviors (e.g., politeness) not only to each other, but also to computers.
Evidence has supported the mindless responses people exhibit when interacting with computers. However, anthropomorphism as an alternative explanation to these social responses has been largely discounted. An experiment (N = 151) was conducted to examine the relationship between anthropomorphism and politeness toward the evaluation of a computer. Other moderating variables, such as reciprocity and physical proximity are tested in this relationship. Results indicated that anthropomorphism and reciprocity affected politeness toward a computer. In addition, the effect of anthropomorphism and physical proximity on politeness was different depending on reciprocity. The results have implications highlighting the roles in which anthropomorphism of computers, physical proximity to computers, and reciprocity of computer interaction enhance the strength of positively-biased social responses. Furthermore, this study extends politeness literature by acknowledging the growing similarities between face-to-face communication and human-computer interactions as a result of anthropomorphism."

The Reasons for and Use of Media Allusions,"Sensemaking in Action: Exile, Consumption, Identity, and Media Allusions","This paper examines the concept of media allusions and the reasons for and use of them by college students. Media allusions are references to or adaptations of lines from movies, television, and other popular media. The literature suggests that people use media allusions as cultural handshakes to identify others with shared social and mediated knowledge and to simply add humor or enjoyment to a conversation. Results showed that people who use media allusions enjoy the puzzle aspect of using and recognizing these allusions in social interactions, and that they derive pleasure from using media allusions to describe situations. Furthermore, these motives for using media allusions are related to personal identity and mood management reasons for using films. Implications for understanding media allusions are discussed."

In three experiments, 494 participants indicated the extent to which they accepted claims that were either supported by anecdotal or statistical evidence. Statistical evidence is more persuasive than anecdotal evidence in support of a claim on a large number of unspecified entities (Experiment 1, 2). In support of a claim on a specific entity, anecdoctal evidence can be as persuasive as statistical evidence (Experiment 2, 3), as long as the case story in the anecdotal evidence is perceived as sufficiently similar to the entity in the claim (Experiment 3). These findings are in accordance with insights derived from argumentation theory."

While the fair use doctrine may allow such copying in specific cases, this paper argues that the courts traditional application of fair use does not provide the clarity that is required to encourage technological innovations for the benefit of society. Instead, a broad-based legal rule should be adopted that would allow search engines to copy material for the purposes of indexing and cataloguing Web sites. Such a rule could be established by adopting a broad law and economics-based fair use rule or by recognizing the existence of an implied license given to search engines by Web site operators to copy for socially beneficial purposes."

The three types of students examined were those that under-estimate the quality of their speeches (those that report their anticipated grade as lower than the grade they actually receive), those that are on-target with their estimations (those that accurately assess their speech grade), and over-estimators (those that report their anticipated grade as significantly higher than the grade they actually achieve). Differences among the three groups were found for reported alcohol consumed and reported state anxiety. No differences among the groups were found for the traditional variables of motivation to perform, practice for the speech, nor for trait anxiety."

Much is yet to be learned about the application of newer, more effective strategies for media campaigns to adolescent smoking prevention interventions. This paper describes a study applying an activation model of information exposure and a sensation seeking targeting approach to the design of a smoking prevention campaign targeting adolescents. The participants were 1,272 middle school students aged 12-14 from across the Colorado Front Range who were stratified by their level of sensation seeking and then exposed to both high and low sensation value anti-tobacco PSAs at 3 time points. Hypothesized effects of the intervention on the primary dependent measuresattitudes (against smoking) and behavioral intentions not to smokewere strongly supported. Further support is offered from the secondary indicators, self-efficacy, perceived message effectiveness, and perceived risk from smoking."

Certain conceptual and methodological challenges to DSIT are discussed. A self-organizing systems model, based on a learning systems approach, used in modeling social networks (Hopfield models) is advanced as a basis for operationalizing tests of DSIT's primary hypotheses concerning consolidation, clustering, correlation, and diversity maintenance of messages indicative of systemic structure. Data from actual asynchronous Internet groups is used for specific hypothesis tests. Preliminary examination of results from previous resaerch using the same data suggests message structure profiles consistent with certain aspects of DSIT."
2006-0118,Associative Framing: A Unified Method for Measuring Media Frames and the Media Agenda,New Perspectives on Priming and Framing,Political Communication,,,Paper,Associative Framing: A Unified Method for Measuring Media Frames and the Media Agenda,New Perspectives on Priming and Framing,"The study of framing is made difficult by the ongoing discussion on
definition, theoretical grounding, and measurement methodology. This
paper proposes a method to automatically measure and visualize associative
media frames.

Associative frames are concept networks or maps and
can be situated between the object attributes of second level agenda setting
and the complex frames often proposed in the literature. These
networks can be interpreted as the media equivalent of the association
networks found in schemata theory, allowing firm psychological
grounding for a theory of associative frame setting.

As a case study, the measurement method is applied to the Dutch news coverage
on Immigration, Islam, and Terror in the past five years. The 9/11
attacks caused a structural increase in media attention to these
issues, and set the associative frames for the rest of the studied period.
The murder on Theo van Gogh by a fundamentalist muslim also caused an
attention peak and strong associations of the other issues with the
Islam, but this was followed by a return to their post-9/11 levels."

It tests structural relationships among collective efficacy, neighborhood belonging, civic participation, and communication resource measured by integrated connection to storytelling network or ICSN. ICSN is conceptualized as dynamic connectedness to neighborhood storytellerslocal media, community organizations, and other residents--in individuals everyday lives; that is, a connection to one neighborhood storyteller stimulates connections to the other neighborhood storytellers. By applying this storytelling model to three ethnic groupsAnglos, Latinos, and Armeniansthis study found the critical role of integrated connection to community storytelling network in promoting civic engagement in both new and old immigrant groups."

The results of the multiple network analyses revealed that strategic alliances in the global telecommunication industry had structural differences between the 1990s and the early 2000s, without any dominant firm in the alliance network. The detailed description of the results is as follows. First of all, the results of the centrality analysis revealed that the centralities over the whole period showed that no single telecommunication firm dominated the alliance space. Secondly, the cluster analysis of the alliance network identified seven alliance groups. Its configuration was stable over time, showing that the number of clusters in the global telecommunication industry has not changed over time. More specifically, seven representative clusters are Japanese + non-US telecommunication, RBOC, Japan-China hybrid, American wireless, AT&T, US-Europe-based and French clusters. Finally, a QAP analysis showed that there were significant differences between the 1990s and the early 2000s in the structure of the alliance network. However, there were significant similarities among telecommunication firms in the early 2000s."

This paper sought to understand protest performances as acts of communication. Performance in this context means a text which carries out a real action in a particular performance space, functioning simultaneously as a text and as a demonstration. This article proposes a three dimensional model for cultural interpretation of protest performances in multi contexts:
A. The diachronic dimension: the historical aspect (a comparison of the performance to other protest performances in critical historical points).
B. The synchronic dimension: the political-current affairs aspect (the relationship between the producer of the performance/text and the political arena and the reaction of the audience to the text and context).
C. The time/space aspect: the cultural view, combining verbal and visual performances.

We propose an interpretative reading which examines these three dimensions and their mutual affinities, in any protest performance. The case study will investigate the Israeli poet Aharon Shabtai and his poetry written during the second Intifada as a complex and intriguing test case, and focus in particular on My Heart (Libi in Hebrew), which was published in April 2002, shortly after a large-scale operation (Defensive Shield) launched by the Israeli Defense Force, following a bloody month on the Israeli side"

Participants (191 remarried individuals) completed questionnaires which measured their level of marital satisfaction (using the MCLI), their attachment style, their levels of commitment and communal strength, and their interpretations of hypothetical repair messages, varying in equivocation level, from their spouses. Interpretations were measured along the dimensions of honesty, competence, and politeness using Likert-type scales developed and successfully employed in previous research. Results of regression and MANOVA analyses found that, as predicted, each of the relational variables positively influenced repair message interpretation and that attachment styles also influenced these interpretations. Results are discussed in terms of the need for relational repair research that makes use of broader predictive models, and that deals with both production and interpretation of repair messages. Suggestions are made for additional, more definitive research."

These two characteristics of media coverage both reflect and shape where an issue is decided, by whom, and with what outcomes. In understanding this process, a number of studies have observed cyclical waves in media attention, and historical shifts in how an issue is framed, linking these features to policy decisions. Yet there has been little theoretical specification and testing of the social mechanisms that drive these cycles. With this in mind, the current study outlines a model for understanding mediated issue development. The theoretical components of the model include the type of policy arena where debate takes place, the media lobbying activities of strategic actors, the journalistic need for narrative structure, and the competition from other issues for attention across policy and media environments. Related factors include the type of journalist assigned coverage, and the level of attention from opinion pages. Using data from a content analysis of twenty five years of coverage at the New York Times and Washington Post, the model is applied and tested against the issue of plant biotechnology."

A total of 26.556 respondents were surveyed about their reading behavior, their recognition of (the content of) ads published in yesterdays newspaper, and their appreciation of these ads. Attention was measured with several measures indicating different levels of ad processing. The included 290 advertisements were then content analyzed and related to the reactions of the readers. Results showed that the influences of media position (i.e. prominent position in the newspaper), ad layout (bigger size) and ad content (more colors) were stronger in the first attention phases (where pre-attention and focal attention of the reader is drawn) than in subsequent phases. On the other hand, influences of reader characteristics (age, reading intensity, ad liking and involvement) were stronger in subsequent phases of attention where comprehension of the message and elaboration takes place."
2006-0126,A Typology of Conflict Avoidance,"Goal Directed Communication: Conflict, Deception, and Comforting",Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,A Typology of Conflict Avoidance,"Goal Directed Communication: Conflict, Deception, and Comforting","When you have a fight with someone, is it better to verbalize your arguments until the other sees or submits to your point, or is it better to withdraw your arguments until both cool off? If you avoid talking to someone about an issue, is it always because you do not care about either partys outcomes? Are all avoidance strategies undesirable? Just as squeaky wheels get oiled, the main stream conflictual communication research has focused on communicative strategies in dealing with conflict, and the non-communicative strategy, or avoidance, has rarely been examined. Avoidance has been largely dismissed as an inactive, passive, and ineffective conflict strategy. The main goal of the paper is to propose a typology of conflict avoidance. Specifically, the typology development uses a theoretical, deductive method. Avoidance is conceptualized along the who, the what, and the temporal dimensions, and embraces six types of variations. The different types of avoidance strategies are compared and examples of each are given. Finally, validation of the typology, future directions, and conclusion are provided."

The managerial grid, the dual-concern model, as well as later revisions on them have maintained the duality of the dimensional structures, and been extended to interpersonal conflict research. In this paper, the authors argue that such extension is problematic. Dimensions that are specific to interpersonal conflict should be used to generate motivations that precede conflict strategies. The paper provides a theoretical framework in developing a typology of interpersonal conflict goals with a deductive method. Significance of the typology and future research directions are discussed."

Theoretically it is to develop a diversified rather than polarised or reductionist conception of the active audience, thereby showing a possibility for a convergence of a variety of active audience studies, in terms of the concept of audience engagement. Empirically, it looks at the various ways in which Japanese audiences engage with the media and ICT in the global rich media environment. It makes use of previously identified dimensions of audience activities from several traditions of audience research and adds to these new dimensions revealed from my ethnography of so-called modern Japanese families living in the media-rich Tokyo Metropolitan Area. The seven modes of engagement I will consider are: information-seeking activity, connectivity, world-creation, parasocial interaction, utility, interpretation and, finally, participation."

The study consisted of six focus group interviews in which participants were shown clips from three recent films and asked to discuss their responses. Participants tended to identify unrealistic elements of the films on the bases of literal impossibility and inconsistency with the viewers sense of psychological or metaphysical laws. There were no clear, systematic differences in the way fans and non-fans of fantasy-based genres described their realism judgments. The implications of the studys findings are discussed with reference to the transportation model of narrative persuasion and recent conceptual research on media realism."
2006-0130,Audience Perceptions of the Objectivity Norm,Assessing News Credibility,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Audience Perceptions of the Objectivity Norm,Assessing News Credibility,"Prior research has centered on defining objectivity with little examination of audience understanding of this norm of American journalism. Journalists are trained to present the news as objectively as possible, yet often the ideal dimensions of objectivity are in direct opposition to one another. This study examines the role of two key dimensions, balance and accuracy, in audience evaluations of news objectivity. Balance, or an equitable presentation of all sides in a story, is in distinct contrast to accuracy, or the presentation of sides in direct proportion to their relative size. In the face of scholarly and professional disagreement over the role of objective reporting in social and political contexts, it is necessary to allow the audience to weigh in. Via a survey of undergraduates that included an experimental component, this study found that audiences perceive balanced news as more objective than news written to reflect the attribute of accuracy."

In particular, this paper argues that Tony Hawk's Underground traverses racial codes in order to mitigate anxieties that the newly mainstream culture of skateboarding may have become inauthentic - and thus, uncool. T.H.U.G. players negotiate the fears of a subculture gone mainstream by exploring and inhabiting highly visible raced (black, Asian, white trash) and working-class characters, all coded by mainstream culture as more real (and interesting) than middle-class white culture. Unfortunately, Tony Hawks Underground makes ample use of racist and classist stereotypes. More, as it shores up its authenticity via people of color and the working-class, T.H.U.G.s stereotypical displays work to maintain the normative qualities of whiteness that invest it with power."
2006-0133,Authenticity for Sale: An Analysis of World Music Label Websites,"Myths, Branding, and Nationalism in Popular Music",Popular Communication,,,Paper,Authenticity for Sale: An Analysis of World Music Label Websites,"Myths, Branding, and Nationalism in Popular Music","Independent labels continue to direct much of their attention on the growing world music market. World music is no longer solely the province of Western pop musical elites, but is now widely seen through the further outgrowth of globalization as constituting a popular music market that has the potential to gain substantial sales traction. Popular media has insinuated the growth of world music to have reached the same level of inevitability as globalization.

Drawing upon work in anthropology and cultural studies, this paper addresses the genre of world music marketed primarily to Western markets by record labels such as Putumayo World Music, Real World Records, and a host of other independent labels. More specifically, through a cultural analysis making use of Raymond Williamss concept of social formalism, this analysis examines the way in which these labels use their websites to construct themselves musically as returning tradition and authenticity to the modern West, which is seen as having become disconnected from its cultural authenticity.

In addition to complementing existing cultural studies approaches to the study of popular music, this analysis integrates the growing scholarship within anthropology examining modernity and global popular music. In more practical terms, this paper provides a tangible cultural analysis of the websites of world music labels, used as primary means in the marketing and selling of world music to Western capitalist markets."

Did the Cubs win last night? On the other hand, people often go online just to surf, with no prior information goal in mind. This study compares the controlled and automatic allocation of cognitive resources between these two different tasks. This study also replicates previous research suggesting that choosing from extensive options carries a cost in terms of the cognitive resources available to encode that which has been chosen."

In a comparative cross-media approach the study focuses on the question how the use of avatars can enhance social presence and interpersonal trust in net-based dyadic collaborations. Special attention is paid to measurements that combine subjective verbal reports and objective behavioral data. For the purpose of this study a special avatar platform (virtual communication environment, VCE) is combined with a shared collaborative workspace (Cool Modes). This setting enables an experimental variation of real time communication modes during net-based collaborations. The experimental conditions were: text chat, voice over IP (audio), web-cam conference (audio-video) and avatar-conference (audio and avatar) using two types of avatars (low fidelity: cartoon like androgynous figure; high fidelity: textured male or female character). Results yield a significant difference between text and all other communication modes, while there was no difference between audio, video and avatar systems in terms of social presence and interpersonal trust. Analyses of nonverbal behavior and visual attention revealed no significant differences between video and avatar conferencing modes. The data raise critical questions about the added value of avatar systems and the specific requirements those systems have to meet to prove superior to mere audio/video transmissions."

An examination of the responses of 51 participants assigned to one of four conditions (black avatar and personal identity, black avatar and group identity, white avatar and personal identity, and white avatar and group identity) revealed that cues from avatar color do indeed affect attitudes, behaviors, and communication patterns, and that these effects can be modified by social identity. Results are discussed with respect to SIDE theory and behavioral intention."

To facilitate donor and recipient matching, websites have been developed that allow those in need of organs to post profiles to be perused by potential donors. The present study is part of a line of research examining those profiles and responses tot hem. Because men generally have less positive attitudes toward organ donation, even though their organs are less likely to be rejected, a related line of research is focusing on developing messages and profiles designed to appeal to men. This study looked at narrative vs. rational messages targeted toward men compared to women. The results indicated that women responded more positively to all the messages, as hypothesized. Message gender x respondent gender x message appeal (narrative vs. rational) interacted, such that the most positive reactions came from women who read the male-oriented, rational message."

From a grounded theory perspective, this study examined the communication of perpetrators (betrayers) in betrayal acts. Results were not only consistent with current literature to suggest that betrayers operate from a prosocial or self-interest motive, but also revealed several new findings. First, justice was a major theme in the decision-making process. Specifically betrayers engaged out of a desire for organizational or personal justice. Secondly, confrontation, while quite uncommon, occurring less than 35% of the time, was explained by victims either asking or telling betrayers about the incident. And lastly, unique findings regarding the emotional labor of betrayal episodes suggest that most betrayers experienced an equal mix of both positive and negative emotions. This may suggest that while dissonant, betrayers often have some rationale for their decision to engage. Limitations and future directions are also discussed."

Relying on data obtained via ethnographic interviews and participant observation, supplemented by an archival and documentary research, I theorize media activism (LGBTQ publications, monitoring, interaction with journalists, press conferences) as strategically important cultural practice initiated by Slovak LGBTQ activists in the past decade. In this paper, I take a closer look at the lesbian issue of the feminist journal Aspekt (1996), the lesbian newsletters L-Listy (1995-1998) and Séparé (1999-2000), the first gay and lesbian monthly magazine Atribút g/l (2000-2003), and the community newsletter Q Archív (2002-2003). These periodicals exemplify important sites of LGBTQ visibility in Slovakia. My analysis focuses on the following questions: What are the initial motivations, conditions of existence and production of these periodicals? What formats, genres, themes, and politics of representation of sexual desires, pleasures, practices and identities characterize each of them? In what ways do these periodicals reflect and shape the agendas of the recently established lesbian and gay NGOs in Slovakia? What do these periodicals do  how do they effect the processes of non-normative identity and community formation?"

This study investigated the effects of avatar choice (choice vs. no choice) and visual point of view (1st person vs. 3rd person) on the physiological arousal and subjective evaluations of game experiences. The results demonstrated that avatar choice (picking the character that will represent the player in the game) leads to greater arousal and especially for males. Visual points of view alone did not affect the game players arousal, but moderated the effect of avatar choice: avatar choice produced a more pronounced effect in the 3rd person point of view in which avatar choice was visually more meaningful than in the 1st person point of view. The results highlight the theoretical implications of a video game's structural features in terms of the game player's emotional experiences."

The identities of Missy, however, were mainly defined in the categories of consumer culture. It was said that young married women called Missy pursued distinctive lifestyles and identities, which could be gained through individualistic consumption. Main argument is that the need to define (young) married women as a market segment in South Korea during the post-Fordist era allowed them active and individual identities. However, the dominant patriarchal ideology of the feminine that perpetuates womens roles as life-givers and sex objects was still being articulated with the Missy discourse. In this research, using discourse analysis, I analyze newspaper content about the consumer culture of young married women in South Korea during the 1990s."

Three research questions are raised. Firstly, why is interpretative journalism a distinct feature of political news coverage today? Secondly, by which journalistic standards should interpretative reporting be evaluated? Thirdly, what are the implications of interpretative journalism to public discourse and the quality of democracy?
The study presented discusses the occurrence of interpretative journalism and possible explanations for the use of this kind of journalism during the last three weeks of the election campaign in Sweden in 2002. Empirical data is based both upon quantitative media content analysis and on structured interviews with journalists and politicians.
The results show that the expansion of interpretative journalism is mainly a product of changing media structures where increased market-orientation and competition for public attention encourages a more provocative and outstanding role for journalists. Accordingly, this new role is probably less concerned about the ability to inform, to scrutinize and to balance and more interested in retaining the audience by being controversial, sensational and entertaining."

By textual agency I mean the capacity to produce speech acts or, more broadly, discursive acts, a capacity that has traditionally been ascribed to human actors only. As shown in this paper, a semiotic approach to communication allows us to open up the traditional speaker-hearer schema by showing how textual entities can also be said to be doing something discursively. In keeping with the semiotic openness to non-linguistic objects, while acknowledging the incarnated dimension of communication, as highlighted by pragmaticians, I show that pragmatics could therefore benefit from opening its perspective to textual agency. Building
on Sbisàs work on speech act theory and what Descombes identifies as tetravalent structures, I show to what extent a given speech act can be attributed not only to the person who produced it, but also to the textual entity he or she produced. It is precisely this logic of imbrication and representation that allows us to open up the traditional speaker-hearer schema by 1) acknowledging action from a distance, what could be called tele-action, while 2) highlighting the chain of agencies that pervade any interactional situation."

Taking as its focus the Moroccan cities of Casablanca and Fès, the present paper uses ethnographic work to explore web-use by men whose sex-lives are focused on other men. (The term gay men will be used to describe this group, even though it is not generally the term used by respondents themselves).

In Casablanca, gay men created elaborate psycho-geographies in the new quartiers built in the French colonial period, developing a repertoire of meeting places. This hidden use of public space came under pressure in the mid-1990s, partly through the spread of rigourist Islam. From the early 2000s, increased internet access, and in particular the rise of a new semi-public space, the cyber-café, widened opportunities for literate gay men in Morocco to meet and associate. This paper attempts to develop an understanding of how web use is reconfiguring what it means to have a preference for male same-sex relationships in Morocco. What shifts in identity positions are occurring? How has inhabiting digital space had an impact on public urban space? Is the web seen as a potential medium for bringing political demands to bear? How important is the international dimension of le chat? What is the pan-Arab dimension of gay web use? At a wider level, the paper provides an element in comparative work on intercultural aspects of the webs interactive potential."

This situation provided an opportunity to investigate the roles of different media in the process of young immigrants settling into their new country, preservation of their original culture, and development of new cultural leanings.
Semi-structured interviews with 60 families who immigrated to Israel and Germany between 1990-2003 were employed. The interviews were conducted with children individually as well as in a focus group comprised of family members in order to investigate the dynamics of family interaction that surround media consumption. The interviews addressed domains such as: media consumption habits, the role of the media in childrens social lives, and the role of the media in family conflicts.
The functions of media for mastery of the host language and maintaining control of the Russian language were found to be a central theme in all spheres of life. As the children seek to fit into their new host-land, they employ the host media to accelerate their language learning as well as to signal the forming of their new identity to parents and friends. At the same time, they are involved in a variegated relationship with media in Russian that can include avoidance, active resistence, but also actively seeking them, as a declaration of a choice of identity."

Led by then-Director of the Bureau of Narcotics, Harry Anslinger, the government mounted a massive public relations campaign designed to vilify marijuana by linking it with social deviance and fear of immigrants and minorities. This public relations campaign remains as one of the most successful of all times, at least in terms of the political and regulatory goals of its progenitors. The purpose of this paper is to explore the antecedents, strategies and tactics, and consequences of this campaign, and to analyze its claims in terms of the available scientific evidence of the day."

Game talk involves communicative sharing and policing of ideas, values and norms within a tortuous, mediated system of game mechanics, digital tradition and wider cultural constraints.

Counter-Strike, played by millions worldwide, makes an excellent case study of gamer interaction. Transcription for this study was gathered digitally and analyzed for conversational sequences that demonstrate more widespread trends in game communication.

Game messages are filled with disembedded references to broader social practice and pop culture. Messages are personal, spontaneous, informal, and linguistically transgressive, performing variety of purposes: from task accomplishment, to entertainment, persuasion, and identity work. This study focuses upon the ways in which participants employ socio-discursive power and construct both sexual identity and inter-gender relations within the game.

Here, the Cartesian dualism imposed by games as media is felt. Masculinity is difficult to demonstrate physicality in games because one need not be macho to win. It is perhaps even more difficult to achieve femininity in a game that features all-male characters partaking in endless violent conflict.

It is through discursive interaction that gamers achieve gender and sexuality in digital play. It is in the display of the mental or social attributes that gender is articulated in cyberspaces where the physical body is abstracted and only the movement of the eyes and hands externally marks the difference between 733T and n00b."

The purpose of this paper is to draw from a cognitive functional model (CFM) of attitude change to formulate a systematic approach that artists may use to create art that meets their aesthetic needs while pragmatically furthering their social concerns. It remains rooted in contemporary theories of visual persuasion, but takes a constructive rather than critical approach. A tripartite variation of the CFM, modified to accommodate the medium of art, is explicated that consists of message immediacy, message personalization and message resolution. This tripartite model is further broken down into a series of five sequential questions that artists may use in the creation of persuasive images."

Several explanations have been furnished. We hold the cultural traits of Shanghai people to be too reductive and too general. Market abundance may be important to understanding the medias complacency, but is still inadequate to account for political factors. In sum, we must explain the political economy of the media in relation to a particular cultural milieu. The most crucial explanation appears to lie in the patron-client relationship in the practices of authoritarian corporatism. Based on field interviews, we conclude that Shanghai is a big city but a small place: a resource-rich city that only has one layer of power authorities, and hence the distance from the epicenter of power to various media organizations is very short, making media control through a patron-client system very effective and powerful. We have examined this patron-client relationship from the perspectives of media conglomeration, elite circulation, resource allocation, and (lack of) media professionalism."
2006-0169,Big Is Still Better in More Ways Than One: An Examination of the Culture and Consciousness Industries,Media and Culture,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Big Is Still Better in More Ways Than One: An Examination of the Culture and Consciousness Industries,Media and Culture,"This paper re-visits Sut Jhallys (1989) framework for examining media structure and content. This approach includes an examination of both the culture industryhow the pursuit of profit has ultimately replaced notions of the public interestand the consciousness industrythe ideologies perpetuated by corporate media. Though these approaches are not mutually exclusive, they are useful for theorizing and analyzing the current political economy of communications. As such, this analysis has two purposes: First, to re-examine Jhallys framework to demonstrate its continued viability and significance as an approach to studying political economy. Second, to provide examples in order to suggest that media scholars continue to bring to light the ties that bind the capitalist class and the strategies used to perpetuate a shared monopoly among transnational media firms, two issues upon which the mainstream media remain silent. Understanding the political economic system is a vital component in the struggle to change the status quo."

This study investigates media framing of two recent hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, in a local daily newspaper in Austin, Texas. Using a content analytic method, a total of 387 articles are examined for the medias use of two specific frames- challenge and stigma frames. The results show that the use of challenge and stigma frames varied between coverage of hurricane Katrina and Rita. While the coverage of Rita was more likely to use challenge frames than stigma frames, the coverage of Katrina was more likely to use stigma and not challenge frames."

The photographic narrative begins with a complication, in which one of the most memorable images of the second Intifada, the bloodstained hands of young Paelestinian, were photographed at police headquarters in Ramallah immediately following the lynching. The narrative's resolution occurred eight months later with this images antithetical repetition, in which a photograph of the same person, chained in a detention cell of the Israeli General Security Services with his hands bound, was distributed to all major Israeli newspapers.
By examining the visual narrative constructed through various media formats, I propose an analytical framework for an encounter between a viewer who identifies with the victim, an Israeli-Jew in this case, and the images of which the narrative consists. My intention in using this type of analysis is to provide an account of several processes involved in the production and consumption of traumatic and healing photographs in contemporary violent conflict, and specifically for the ways in which visual archives work within national conflicts."
2006-0172,Boogie Woogie Dreams: Early African-American Representations in Musical Short Films,The Popular in Perspective,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Boogie Woogie Dreams: Early African-American Representations in Musical Short Films,The Popular in Perspective,"The link between the feature-length films and the short films is inevitable; musical shorts were part of the progression to talking films and their prominence as a medium coincided with the emergence of feature-length films with all-black casts, also musical in nature. However, what should be asked is why sound film, as early as the first experimental pieces, exploited the musical talents of African-American artists rather than including them as dramatic actors in their own milieus. Furthermore, what did musical shorts offer that feature-length films could not? What types of narratives and representations did they employ? Also, which images and narratives from previously seen black performance onscreen were negotiated with alternative representations? Most importantly, did the jazz and blues artists featured in these short films offer the opportunity to present non-stereotypical representations and to what extent could they do this?
This project analyzes seven musical shorts featuring iconic black performers Duke Ellington, Bessie Smith, Lena Horne, Ethel Waters and Nina Mae McKinney. There are several reasons why these short films and later soundies are crucial to early black representation. Hundreds of these shorts were made between the late 1920s and mid 1940s, but information about them tends to be scarce. However, considering their trajectory in the development of black representation in Hollywood, they are within a key formative moment of black representation. In looking for positive representations of African-Americans, Hollywood went to black singers, musicians and dancers that white audiences already knew, a practice that continues with black representation today."

An experiment (N = 323) was conducted to study the effects of these formats on credibility, reliability, and intention to purchase the magazine. Six versions of the same magazine were created that varied on two dimensions of commercialism, namely percentage of brand integrations and source. The results showed that the percentage of brand integrations negatively affected perceptions of credibility and reliability of the format. The perception of the source as commercial or non-commercial had no effect. With respect to intention to purchase the magazine, there was an interaction effect of source and percentage of brand integrations. The results show that source credibility theory applies to brand integrated magazine formats. This study adds to the small body of academic research on the proliferating practice of mixing advertising and editorial content."

On account of the wide range of companies and scenes in this important part of the market for recorded music, only a general consideration of the topic was possible.
To sum it up one may say that - based on an analysis of the competitive situation as well as the value chain - independent record labels will have to search for a clear strategic positioning in the market increasingly.
A key role in the strategies of independent record labels as differentiation focusers should play brand management. It offers Independents many opportunities to improve their competitive position that are contrasted by just a few threats. Long-term preferences should be build not only for the artists respectively their releases but also for the label itself, especially considering the fact that independent record labels seem to be predes-tined for branding. The added value of labels as brands must be commu-nicated. Simultaneously the branding measures have to be adjusted to each product personality. In this way the label as brand could be the stra-tegic key to marketing."
2006-0175,Brand Network: Betty Crockers Commercial Community,The Popular in Perspective,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Brand Network: Betty Crockers Commercial Community,The Popular in Perspective,"To many consumers, Betty Crocker is more than a fictional icon created for a General Mills advertising campaign. In 1945, Fortune magazine reported that Betty Crocker was the second most influential woman in the United States, ranking after Eleanor Roosevelt. According to a 2004 article by journalist and food historian Laura Shapiro, Betty Crocker remains Americas most successful culinary expert to this day and still watches over home cooking from a unique perch in the nations collective imagination (89).
Such a phenomenon raises questions about why Betty Crocker was so strongly embraced, especially during the early 1940s. How have figures created for brand campaigns, like Betty Crocker, become referents for self-identity, and ultimately, part of social networks? The purpose of research for this article was to explore how advertisers construct the role of brand icons in mediating social networks and self-identities, and, in turn, how consumers construct notions of self- identity and community in relation to a product brand. With particular interest in formation of brand community, Betty Crocker radio program scripts were studied to see how General Mills framed American homemakers and Betty Crocker in commercial messages. Dear Betty Crocker letters from listeners to the radio program during World War II were also studied to see how 1940s homemakers framed self-identity and community in relation to a product brand. The author argues that brand networks could encourage fellowship, personal value and affirmation, and ultimately, might contribute to shaping a consumers role as woman, wife, and patriot."

This study explores newspaper coverage over a period of five years to examine media content. The study also includes interviews with editors of the papers to observe the factors that led to this coverage. Using the hoopla hypothesis, the study employs a content analysis of 3,358 newspaper articles and interviews with a convenience sample of 23 editors from the same newspapers.
Across all four newspapers studied, there were discernable pre-hoopla, hoopla, and post-hoopla stages. The hoopla period, characterized by the most number of stories, was ushered in by identifiable triggering events. A comparison of the national and regional newspapers coverage showed that the coverage was more intense in the national newspapers that produced longer and in-depth articles. The results also show that regardless of the scope of coverage (national vs. regional), coverage intensity is related to the prevalence of dowry within a sub-national region and the newsworthiness of dowry casesa characteristic that is reiterated in the editors responses."

Forty-five interviews were conducted with members in 15 intercultural friendship dyads. The results reveal that seven types of activities were identified: (1) positivities/providing assistance; (2) rituals, activities, rules, and roles; (3) self-disclosure; (4) networking; (5) exploring cultures and languages; (6) emphasizing similarities and exploring differences; and (7) conflict/conflict management. Additionally, third parties (e.g., family, friends) and the third cultural context (e.g., the host culture) both significantly contribute to the relational identity development."

The Social Shaping of Public Wi-Fi in Austin, Texas",Communication and Technology High Density Session,"The social impact of technological innovations is intimately bound to the design, implementation, and uses of technological systems that provide new services to communities around the country. Public wireless broadband access has been proposed as a strategic component of policies aimed at achieving universal broadband access by 2007. However, few studies have explored how the rollout of public wireless networks is delivering the promise of high-speed services for all. Employing a social construction of technology approach, this paper delves into some of these issues by examining the process of configuration of public Wi-Fi networks in Austin, Texas. Austin is one of the most unwired cities in the U.S., and increasingly known as a world-class business center in wireless. Drawing in semi-structured interviews and a network analysis of stakeholders (industry, nonprofits, local government, and research and educational institutions), a survey of managers of hotspots, Wi-Fi users at these locations, and socio-geographic information, this study examines the factors shaping the public wireless broadband access in Austin. The presence of a critical mass of early adopters, strong network collaboration between private, public and non-profit organizations, and the spillover effects of the local high-tech economy are identified as main factors behind the growth of public Wi-Fi in the city. The legacy of anti-munitelecom laws, the predominance of the commercial model of access, and the lack of digital inclusion efforts are hindering the expansion of the innovation in poorer areas of the city."

This is especially evident when considering the emerging field of political marketing. Despite the growing influence of public relations, however, little application of public relations theory and research has been integrated into the study of political marketing processes. Thus, this work seeks to bridge two schools of thought and to identify some of the major conceptual perspectives from public relations theory that can be used to better understand and analyze the dynamics of political marketing processes. Specifically, the key perspectives include relationship theory, contingency theory, situational theory of publics and agenda-building theory. It is reasoned that political marketing and public relations are closely related, and that political marketing both as a professional practice and as an academic field of research hardly can do without making use of public relations strategies, techniques, and an integration of public relations theory and research."

The increasing globalization of broadcasting, made international media organizations (notably the BBC), to enter into agreement with some Nigerian private broadcasters to rebroadcast the foreign medias news program live on the local FM/AM stations. However, last April, the NBC, citing possible harm of such broadcast to national interest, banned the live rebroadcasting of foreign medias news and threatened sanctions. In the aftermath of the prohibition, the question asked is whether such a ban has any legality having regards to Section 39 of the constitution that guarantees freedom of expression and the right to receive and impart information. This paper examines the statutory, regulatory, and constitutional provisions as contained in the NBC Act, the National Broadcasting Code, and the Constitution respectively. The paper found that Constitutional freedoms are not absolute and Nigerias broadcast regulations, as they currently are, provide justification for the NBC action. Findings of this paper will add to our understanding of how nations of the global South craft legislation and regulations aimed at liberalizing broadcasting locally but curtailing the influence of global media organizations. The paper also enhances our understanding of the dynamics of media law in emerging democracies that are confronting the challenges of balancing broadcast deregulation and freedom of expression on the one hand with media control and regulation on the other hand."

Dynamics among public relations professionals, journalists, and the media content are discussed.

We first identified characteristics of blogs and organizational bloggers and then conceptualized the organizational bloggers in terms of a dialogical self. In the proposed model, the salience of narrative structure, dialogic disposition as a dialogical self, and perceived blogger credibility are assumed to lead to increased interactivity, which ultimately culminates in higher relational trust. Finally, the proposed model was discussed as an extension of the two-way symmetrical model, and practical implications for mediated public relations were provided."

The limited previous research on food-related news examined framing of individual food-related issues, such as genetically engineered foods and obesity, but did not attempt to provide an integrated overview of the social construction of food in news nor examine the specific site of this study: news magazine covers. Key findings included that the most prevalent food-related topics on news magazines covers were fat/obesity, diets, food-borne illness and alcohol. The framing that emerged reflected dominant themes of technology over nature, interest group liberalism over popular democracy, and self-reliance over mutuality. These foundational themes and counterthemes from Gamson (1992) were expanded into a typology specifically for food-related news, which may facilitate further research in this area."

The data analyses provided partial support for the hypothesis that campaign ads function as a significant agenda setter for the news media. Televised candidate commercials meaningfully influenced subsequent candidate coverage on television, yet showed a mutual relationship with the print news. The data, however, provided strong support for the print newss role as an agenda initiator for broadcasting news. It was also found that the tone of advertising moderated the effects of campaign ads on subsequent news coverage; there was a stronger correspondence of the news agenda with oppositional ads than with self-promoting ads."
2006-0201,Can Loss-Frame Accelerate Cooperation?,Advances in Advertising Research II,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Can Loss-Frame Accelerate Cooperation?,Advances in Advertising Research II,"This study investigates the framing effects of public service announcement (PSA) messages on individuals cooperative intentions. This research is based on the assumption that the goal of help-others PSAs (i.e., to persuade audiences to perform prosocial behaviors) is to induce cooperation from individuals trapped in social dilemma. Based on this assumption, this study tests the effects of PSA frames on audiences cooperative intentions and the moderating role of issue types. The four distinct PSA frames, i.e., utility-gain frame, utility-loss frame, sanctioning norm frame and rewarding norm frame, did not bring significantly different cooperative intentions. When PSA issues were divided into two types (i.e., the public goods issue and the commons issue), however, utility-loss frame, compared to utility-gain frame, was found to be effective to induce the higher cooperative intentions for the public goods issue. The findings suggest that even though neither utility-frames nor norm-frames are universally effective for inducing cooperation, concerning the public goods issue at least, utility-loss frame seems to accelerate cooperation."

But what happens when someone gives the dog a microphone?
This paper reports the results of a controlled field experiment in which voice communication was introduced into an existing online community (an online gaming guild within the popular game World of Warcraft). Qualitative and quantitative results were compared to a control group and revealed several significant findings: voice helped establish deeper relationships, added to group diversity and improved trust, but also insulated group members from meeting new people. The findings are discussed with respect to social capital, cyberbalkanization and the general CMC & HCI literatures."

According to Entman, news reporters are more likely to construct issues through elite perspectives and culturally resonant frames; thus, this case tests whether the combination of a cultural announcement (The Indians are ripping us off!) uttered by an elite (Governor Arnold Schwarenegger) during an event (the election), results in critical counter-frames or frames that defer to elite power. Findings display variants that allow Entmans model to stand as an exploration of how governmental hegemony over information shapes discourse which affects individual perceptions and social change. The fact that public opinion polls were pulled to the side of the Governor each time he criticized Proposition 70 speaks to the power of political contexts, as well as the foresight of the administrators who know how to employ them."

Even after the April 1999 shootings at Columbine prompted mainstream media to turn attention to school size research, journalists continued to disregard some key findings that could have informed efforts to relate school size to the Colorado tragedy. This study concludes that, while research that challenges conventional education policy would presumably attract the attention of journalists interested in institutional conflict, the mainstream U.S. media, while momentarily focusing attention on the issue, soon returned its focus on relatively superficial, tangential yet sexier angles of absentee parenting, teen angst and video violence that resonate with the popular discourse."

The number of workers on Foreign Domestic Worker visa increased dramatically from 5,000 to 140,000 in 2002, about one in every seven households, a rate ranked among the highest in the world. Most foreign domestic workers in Singapore are live-in, rather than live-out, maids. Cellphone, or handphone  whether the employers should and do allow the domestic workers to have a handphone, and whether the employers know that the helpers have a handphone or not  is a frequent topic of discussion among workers and employers. While previous research has emphasized the role of culture and religion in worker resistance, by drawing on in-depth interviews with thirty-one employers and forty-three foreign domestic workers, this paper attempts to situate the role of a networking technology in domestic workers struggles against subjection."

This paper proposes a theoretical model and discusses various mediating and moderating variables to consider in the study of the relationship between cell-phone usage (CPU) and social interaction with proximate others (SIPO). The model is then applied to a modest experiment of cell-phone usage in the context of social participation. Results indicate that while on the cell phone, users are less likely to feel an obligation to help proximate others. Moreover, by nonverbally communicating a diminished sense of friendliness, cell-phone users convey a greater presumption of privacy, which in turn affects their social interactions with proximate others. The paper calls for more empirical testing of CPUs psychological effects as we develop a social code for proper cell-phone use in public places."

American Library Association (2003) denied the public a right to receive information over public Internet access. Although it does not set judicial precedent, the pluralitys reasoning in this case could prove a critical turning point for future determinations of whether end users have any speech rights online. Furthermore, the decision is emblematic of modern public forum laws inability to protect public sites for expression and the harmful consequences of the governments growing power over public space. Drawing on critiques of contemporary public forum doctrine, judicial precedents and dissents, and theories of government speech, I offer important distinctions that the law could make to limit the power of government to censor speech in public spaces and distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate government control of speech. I conclude that public forum law is better reformed than abandoned, since it still holds out the best hope for protecting critical spaces for the public exercise of speech rights."

A turning point analysis compared changes in commitment for geographically close and long distance same-sex friendships. The majority of both types of friends reported high levels of commitment and fluctuations in commitment levels over the relational history. Over eighty percent of the long distance friends reported their commitment levels were currently rising rather than falling. These findings provide evidence that proximity and frequent face-to-face contact are not requirements for committed friendships and that this relationship may not be as vulnerable to a lack of proximity as is often portrayed.

Forty first-grade students were asked about their level of recall and liking of 11 trade characters, their parents were also asked about purchase requests and subsequent conflict related to these characters. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM), results indicated a relation between recall of characters and liking of characters. The liking of a given character was linked to a parent report of purchase requests and, lastly, purchase requests for products were positively linked to parent-child conflict. Incidentally, television viewing and recall were not related, although it was associated with liking of character and parent-child conflict. These findings are the first to link child knowledge and attitudes towards trade characters with behavioral outcomes."

A paper-and pencil questionnaire was developed and administered to 235 children from Grades 2 and 5. Results showed that the questionnaire clearly differentiated between direct frights and worries induced by news content and between four different coping strategies: Behavioral Approach, Behavioral Avoidance, Cognitive Approach, and Cognitive Avoidance. Childrens direct frights of news were found to decrease with age, while their worries remained stable. Cognitive and avoidance strategies were used more often than behavioral and approach coping and girls reported more use of coping strategies than boys did."

It is a natural extension from Chinas century-long nationalism movement, but it is different from the CCPs official version of patriotism. Taking advantages of the online technology, Chinese cyber nationalism has been utilizing the Internet as a communication center, organizational platform, and execution channel to promote the nationalism causes among Chinese nationalists around the world. In this research, the author reviewed the theoretical construct of this new concept by examining its three components (Chineseness, cyber sphere, and nationalism) and the three derivative concepts (cyber nationalism, Chinese nationalism, and Chinese cyber sphere). An online survey was conducted among Chinese online discussants to obtain information regarding their media use habit, nationalism belief, leadership evaluation, and demographic data. The statistical results showed strong correlations between peoples online media use and their nationalism tendency, and between online discussants nationalism sentiment and their leadership evaluation. The political implications of these results were also discussed."

Conglomerated: The Case of the Shenzhen Press Group,Intercultural & Development Communication Top Papers,"The Chinese press, instead of acting purely as a state propaganda instrument, now functions as a Party Publicity Inc.that is, a quasi-business that seeks to make huge profits on the one hand and to legitimate Party mandate by promoting its image on the other. The accelerated pace of media conglomeration following Chinas accession to the World Trade Organization has sharpened this trend. This study examines the impact of press ecology in Shenzhen, a national trend-setter for the Party Publicity Inc., before and after conglomeration. We observe that press conglomeration has (a) engendered a more centralized management structure and operation; (b) replaced duopolistic competition with market monopoly and greater price-fixing abilities; (c) continued to rely on state office subscription; (d) dampened journalists enthusiasm for political reform in favor of economic interest; (e) developed a two-tier Publicity Inc. to serve both the Party and the market; and (f) provided an opportunity for overseas expansion. Marketization does not trigger political reform, but preempts pressure for political change. The Party Publicity Inc. in its conglomerate form represents a complicitous accommodation between power and money engineered by a post-Communist bureaucratic-authoritarian regime."

Using as a theoretical foundation Nelsons (1995, 2001) concept of counterstories, the author establishes a need for narrative repair and suggests a counterstory as a metaphorical shield from the scientific gaze and the Procrustean approach of the biomedical model."

After collecting news stories from four circulation groups, the content of the stories of public relations was analyzed. This study found that the circulation sizes, news types, news topics, and the gender of reporters were significantly related to the descriptions of the public relations in news stories. Large newspapers used more critical, negative standpoints toward public relations than small newspapers, whereas small newspapers took more favorable, positive positions. Feature and straight news stories about public relations used neutral sources and non-emotional symbols frequently, whereas editorials and opinions used emotional symbols for public relations. Male reporters relied on more negative frames and less neutral sources than did female reporters."
2006-0216,Citizenship and Use of Traditional and New Media for Information and Entertainment,Citizenship and the Democratic Responsibility of Journalism,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Citizenship and Use of Traditional and New Media for Information and Entertainment,Citizenship and the Democratic Responsibility of Journalism,"The rapid diffusion of new applications of the Internet and new media such as cell phones with Internet access, MP3 players, and DVD players make it critical to examine how traditional media use for information and entertainment are being affected. Similarly it is important to understand what impact the new and traditional media are having on indicators of citizenship as such as a sense of needing the news, interest in politics, levels of cynicism, and community participation. Secondary analysis of a large national mail survey allowed us to observe the interrelations of time spent with new and traditional media, and the impact of time spent with these media on indicators of citizenship. Results show complementarity among television, newspaper, and Internet use, but some significant competition between entertainment and informational use of these media. Entertainment use of media negatively impacts citizenship indicators and informational use of media positively impacts them. Journalisms mission to provide critical information for citizens in a democracy hinges on citizens willingness to engage with such information. Our goals in this paper are to identify media behaviors and draw conclusions about corresponding changes in indices of civic involvement.
It seems possible that the pattern of amusing ourselves to death could persist and even increase. If this occurs, the prospects for rational discourse in society through the news media are dim and the implications for our democracy are grave."
2006-0217,Classical Imagery and Early Representations of Black South Africans,Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Paper Session,Ethnicity and Race in Communication,,,Paper,Classical Imagery and Early Representations of Black South Africans,Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Paper Session,"When colonisers met colonised in early South African writing, their accounts were often far more complex than historians and cultural critics have allowed. This paper shows how classical literature and art shaped the ways in which the colonisers came to terms with the colonised  how they responded to their customs, bodies and actions. (While some uses of classical names for slaves might have been ironic or deliberately pre-Christian, this tradition is largely positive.)
Early accounts used frames from classical literature to describe relationships between European men and African women. In describing the African male body, too, the descriptions turned to classical visual and political parallels.
This tradition lasted through much of the nineteenth century but the rising tide of settler hostility, missionary influence and social Darwinism brought different, racialised, discourses prescribing how black bodies were to be described. In many ways, the seventeenth and eighteenth century descriptions provided a positive way of framing difference that is still being rediscovered."

Their diverse use shows the lack of agreement about their meaning. By reconstructing the origins and the common characteristics of such diverse interpretations the author offers a way to regain their conceptual value and move on beyond ritualized usages and terminological confusion. Three examples concerned with culture and communication demonstrate the conceptual richness across disciplines. Especially research on intercultural communication benefits from the application of etic and emic as these terms systematically allow to investigate more than one culture at a time. Etic and emic even provide the means to illumine, contrast, and explain the particularities of the different emic views and how they affect intercultural communication."

Specifically, it tests the assertion that success at media use is a function of the difficulty of the medium in relation to the audience member's ability to use the medium. 138 young adults were tested for cognitive skills in four domains and played simple video games that required skill in those domains. As predicted, individual differences in cognitive skill predicted success in game play. Importantly, these relationships remained after controlling for sex and game playing experience."

This study utilized a focus-group methodology to stimulate conversation among nonprofit practitioners with experience in IOR collaborations. The data suggest that challenges exist across three meta-themes. We found that communication challenges are common and that communication is viewed as essential to both the processes and outcomes of collaborations. The authors discuss how practitioner perspectives connect with published literature on collaborative practices and challenges."

The study found university Web sites excelling in ease of interface functions and largely acceptable in information provider capabilities. The universities relational communication capabilities, however, were not being fully explored. Finally, correlations between selected universities organizational traits and Web sites found retention to be the greatest benefit of exemplary Web site design followed by recruitment of quality high school students and alumni giving."
2006-0222,Commitment Versus Trust as Predictors of Customer Adoption of Electronic Service and Communication Channels,Trust and Message Framing in E-Commerce,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Commitment Versus Trust as Predictors of Customer Adoption of Electronic Service and Communication Channels,Trust and Message Framing in E-Commerce,"Two survey studies were conducted to test whether the adoption of e-services offered to customers can be better explained by either trust or commitment. Several studies have already established the effect of trust on adopting e-services. Based on studies in the literature on trust and commitment in intimate relationships, as well as studies on the role of trust and commitment in the relationship between companies and their customers, it is argued that commitment is a more likely predictor of customer adoption of e-services than trust. Two survey studies among customers of a bank and a training institute confirm that commitment is a better predictor of adopting e-services than trust. The implications for future research are discussed."
2006-0223,Communicating About HIV/AIDS: Attitude Functions and Willingness to Talk About Condoms and Sexuality in Mozambique,Communication for Healthcare,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Communicating About HIV/AIDS: Attitude Functions and Willingness to Talk About Condoms and Sexuality in Mozambique,Communication for Healthcare,"Teachers have been given a major role in creating awareness of HIV/AIDS and in ensuring that young people have the knowledge and skills to protect themselves. This study examines the extent to which attitude functions towards talking about condoms and sexuality impacts on teachers willingness to address HIV/AIDS in school and community settings in Mozambique. Data were collected through a survey among a stratified sample of 606 primary and secondary school teachers.
The results of the study provide support for the fact that attitude functions selectively impact on teachers willingness to talk about HIV/AIDS in Mozambique and suggest that a better understanding of attitude functions may improve communication messages and bean important input into training and support of teachers. Using multinomial logistic regression the study found that teachers holding weak or moderate value expressive attitude functions were more than twice as likely to have talked about HIV/AIDS in their school and in their community in the past month and to intend to do so in the future, than those holding strong value expressive attitude functions. A similar relationship was found between strong and moderate utilitarian attitude functions and both past school and community communication behavior as well as future intentions. A third - socio-defensive - attitude function impacted on past communication behavior in schools and on future intentions, but not on past behavior in communities. Possible implications for support to teachers as part of HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness are discussed."

Based on 13 interviews, this article provides a thematic analysis of alliances among U.S. based disaster relief agencies and their work to prevent and respond to crises. In particular, three themes emerged from the data: 1) planning, 2) structure, and 3) the collaboration continuum. Our research builds on existing inter-organizational theories and provides a distinctive conceptual framework that arises from this new empirical understanding of collaboration in disaster scenarios. Future research needs are identified."

In the current context of European integration, the public dispute between traditionalists and modernisers-Westernisers in Romania has gained momentum. The so-called 'strawberry pickers' are key to the way the West and Westernisation are viewed in a national context and in the way symbolic geography is imagined and communicated."

The essay first examines the transdisciplinary literature on the former Yugoslavia as it relates to constructing problematic dichotomies of victim/villain, objective/subjective, and official/vernacular. Using an ethnographic vignette and narrative analysis the study illustrates how participants, reacting to a perceived threat to their identity, construct narratives that emphasize injustice and suffering, thus creating a contrasting identity centered around victimage. Therein participants amalgamate personal and collective memories to explain contemporary victimization as historical continuance. Through constant reproduction of historical victimage in vernacular discourse, participants contest and counter the internationally accepted version of their ethnic group being the absolute and exclusive victimizer, and construct a counter-identity suggestive of silenced and marginalized communities. Functions of victimization narratives and identities are explored, and the essay attempts to demonstrate the importance of problematizing explanations that posit unidimensional identity and victimage in relation to conflict intervention and resolution, not only in former Yugoslavia, but also other conflicts around the world."
2006-0227,Communication About Policy Intentions of the Government: Unwanted Propaganda or Democratic Inevitability?,"Public Relations, Governmental, and Political Campaigning",Public Relations,,,Paper,Communication About Policy Intentions of the Government: Unwanted Propaganda or Democratic Inevitability?,"Public Relations, Governmental, and Political Campaigning","Recent developments in politics, the media and society have stressed the rising importance of public communication from the Government about policies not yet been adopted by Parliament. The commonly used practice of floating trial balloons to gauge the publics support, however, is highly criticised not only because of the blurring lines between policy intentions and real decisions, but also due to fear of propaganda. At the same time, the practice has been defended as a democratic inevitability; policy makers must interact with society before plans reach the final stage of decision making. Government communication professionals and journalists are key figures in this process but conflicting interests mark a tense relationship. Up until now, few empirical studies have been conducted to shed light on the opinions of both professions concerning communication about not yet adopted policy (CNAP). This article presents our empirical data focusing on the appropriate professionals opinions regarding the acceptance of CNAP, their arguments, and the conditions CNAP must meet. We studied the issue in both the Netherlands and Belgium because research has shown that these countries stand out with regard to debating and reflecting on CNAP. Our findings reveal that Dutch journalists are more sceptical towards government CNAP than their Belgian colleagues as well as their countrymen-government communication professionals."

Nonetheless, they continue to face large and small problems for which they must find solutions if the family unit is to remain stable. This investigation found that both college students (n = 156) and their parents (n = 91) use a variety of techniques to solve family problems. Both groups showed a bias for action over talk and both groups similarly eschew abdicating responsibility and using control tactics. When the two groups were compared, parents identified action strategies more than did college students while the students identified inclusion and abdication more often than did the parents."
2006-0251,Communication Technologies and Health Care: Diagnosis of Theoretical Contributions to the Study of Telemedicine,Health Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,Health Communication,,,Paper,Communication Technologies and Health Care: Diagnosis of Theoretical Contributions to the Study of Telemedicine,Health Communication Division Interactive Paper Session,"Our paper addresses a gap in existing literature to explain successes and failures of telemedicine. Rather than attempt to generalize through clinical and cost outcomes, we re-frame existing state of knowledge of telemedicine through a critical review of three distinct theoretical paradigms: diffusion of innovation theories, cognitive approaches, and behavior change theories. This review reveals that communication-based theoretical explanations for telemedicines successes and failures are still in their infancy. To understand the co-evolution of communication processes and telemedicine, there is an urgent need to examine its current and long-term consequences and constraints (Whitten & Collins, 1997) including: (a) critical implications for cost and access related to deployment of telemedicine; (b) changing patient-provider inter-relationships and its effect on health outcomes at a social level; (c) ethical issues raised by implications for privacy of personal information; and, (d) sociological consequences implying fundamental changes to quality of life and societal expectations of health. Such implications embody fundamental questions about the impact of telemedicine on the very health of our society."

School Violence and Terrorism

What has happened over the past 20 years to improve schools in the United States? How do schools change traditions of isolation while creating safe, caring, learner-centered organizations? How can the underlying causes of violence and terrorism be prevented? Combating violence and terrorism requires that adults in schools change the way they behave; organize and deliver instruction; and relate to their communities. In this paper we examine the social context that would reduce school violence and terrorism; assess current condition of values and beliefs about public schools in the US; and through a social capital theoretical framework, posit five principles of personalized, authentic learning environments linked to high student achievement and prevention of school violence and terrorism. Implications for instructional practice and future research on administrator and teacher practice and preparation are explored."

Early evaluation studies already indicated that these anthropomorphic interfaces induce social reactions on the part of the user: When confronted with virtual agents, human participants show communication behaviors that are similar to those shown in human-to-human interaction. The paper gives a review on relevant research and discusses several explanations that have been proposed for these effects. Against this background a research agenda for the communicative sciences is proposed."

Often overlooked is the fact that the theory is fundamentally, i.e. in its speech pragmatics, an empirical one. There is an empirical literature. However, extant studies do not actually test the theorys propositions. This paper reports such a test, with the aim of assessing whether the theorys concepts provide enough empirical purchase to guide the development of measures useful for predictive purposes. Methodological implications of the theory are explored and an operational definition of communicative action is proposed. The test of a legitimation hypothesis derived from the theory is then described. High school students are surveyed regarding state government oversight of their citys municipal budget. A structural equation model is estimated on these data using partial least squares techniques. In closing, the prospects for this approach to employing and testing the theory of communicative action are assessed."

It gave voice to Latino/a American subordinates who disclosed riveting details of their experiences with supervisors. Thematic analysis indicated that the women assumed the role of educator, teaching others the norms of their culture. It also revealed that heterogeneous relationships with bosses required the women to exert more energy to overcome intercultural differences. Interestingly, the presence of other Latino/a Americans sometimes lead to interracial competition. Similarly, the Latino American men maintained that same-race superior-subordinate dyads posed fewer challenges than communicating across races. The men further reported that interracial competition made communication with a Latino/a American bosses somewhat stressful, but communicating with bosses who spoke the same language helped alleviate stress. Further, the men found that their ideas were not as readily embraced as those of dominant groups; the same idea would be praised if it were submitted by a dominant member. Finally, skin color sometimes dictated how people communicated with the men. When their Latino American features were concealed or less obvious, others in the organization did not treat them differently based on their race. The men perceived that the communicative practices employed by their colleagues and superiors were contingent on the prominence of physical features that were widely associated with their race. Overall, the participants communicate about the strategies they utilize to successfully communicate and network with their bosses."
2006-0256,Community Media and Direct Representation,Local and Community-Level Perspectives on Citizen Engagement,Political Communication,,,Paper,Community Media and Direct Representation,Local and Community-Level Perspectives on Citizen Engagement,"This paper examines e-democracy in the era of read-write media by comparing the goals and structures of e-government with community-based media initiatives. I draw directly on Steven Colemans (2003) finding that political apathy can be attributed to the culture of institutional politics, a culture that alienates large parts of the population within Western democracies. Adequate representation requires that politicians understand the views and concerns of the people they claim to represent. Is this aspect of democracy diminishing? If so, how can politicians access what it feels like to be a citizen? How do we know that our concerns are being taken into account? What is the role of the media in this equation?

Participatory, community-based media would seem to hold at least a partial solution to this problem as it allows citizens to bring their concerns into the public sphere. Where e-government has chiefly concentrated on the provision of services and community empowerment through policy deliberation, this paper looks at how broader community communication, including personal narrative and stories, may contribute to the project of e-democracy. Participation and representation have become defining issues in a globalising world. As such, the history of community-based media provides some valuable lessons for e-democracy."

Many industries have become global and national bor-ders are no longer of significance, which is especially true for member states of the European Union.
However, publishing markets are partly exempted from this process. An increasing number of publishing companies internationalise and enter foreign markets. Despite this development publishing markets remain geographically limited. Coalescence in publishing industries has not taken place due to cultural and linguistic barriers. Newspaper and magazine markets as adequate examples are object of investigation within the scope of this paper. More specific, this paper focuses on media economic analysis of newspaper and magazine sectors in Denmark and Germany."

This study evolved from three theoretical perspectives: the international business perspective, the international public relations perspectiveincluding the contextual perspectiveand the European sociological public relations perspective. Sixty-one, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with top-level professionals in the capital and main commercial cities in these three countries. The primary conclusion is that public relations professionals have a role to play in the transformation of countries toward globalized economies. They may also contribute to ethical political systems of participative democracies in which everyone has a public platform to voice their interests and achieve full social development. From an economic perspective, the reality of the three countries studied is permeated by socioeconomic instability and the incapacity to overcome poverty and social inequalities. The social illnesses and exclusion call for cooperation among governments, the private sector, and non-governmental and nonprofit organizations to strengthen civil society and jointly implement solutions with a greater chance to achieve social transformation. Each of the three societies faces diverse degrees of political conflict. With the exception of government public relations professionals, practitioners strongly reject the association of their social or business interventions in their environments as political actions. Public relations professionals in these nations choose to disassociate themselves from discredited practices of the political establishment."

The present study examines the relative influence of parents and peers through its investigation of parental vs. peer mediation of antisocial (violent and sexual content) video game play during late adolescence. Using the same logic, procedures, measures, and analytical framework as Nathanson (2001b) used in her investigation of antisocial television mediation, the present study explored peer mediation of antisocial video game play as a predictor of adolescents perceptions of peer attitudes, adolescents own attitudes, and adolescents aggression. Results indicate that peer mediation occurred more frequently than and predicted adolescents aggression to a greater extent than did parental mediation. Furthermore, adolescents positive orientations toward antisocial video games, which is a function of their own and their peers attitudes toward antisocial game content, mediated the relationship between peer discussion of antisocial video games and adolescents aggression."

Six dependent variables were investigated: speech quality, examination grades, student satisfaction, communication apprehension, attitudes toward course, and instructor evaluation. Several potential covariates were measured. We found no difference between traditional and web-based instruction in the quality of instruction (speech grades, expert ratings of speeches, exam scores). However, student attitudes indicated a significant preference for the traditional format (although the effect size was quite small)."

The comparison was made among local employees in four countries; China, the Filipinos, Malaysia, and the United States, and also included Japanese expatriates in those countries. Our research concludes that each cultural group has different views toward Japanese human resource management practices. We also found that the Chinese view most of the human resource management dimensions as being practiced less sufficiently than many of the other cultures and Japanese counterparts. The Americans felt the same way for several aspects. These perception gaps indicate that in these particular cultures, the Japanese expatriates and local employees hold either different cultural schemas or different expectations of Japanese companies in terms of the issues brought up. There is concern that these discrepancies may influence their views of each other or the relationships."

Satisfactory reliability (Cronbach alpha) was found for almost all of the subscales. Furthermore, significant correlation was found between most of the subscales of the CMC competence measure and frequency of web use, e-mail use and instant messaging / chat use. Finally, the total scores and the items of the subscales of the CMC competence measure were used in separate factor analyses. The uncovered factors/dimensions of CMC competence corresponded to the agency and communion dimensions of interpersonal interaction, and also to the knowledge, motivation and skills model of interpersonal competence. The potential educational use of the CMC competence measure is also briefly discussed."

Attempts to reconcile both positions have met with varying degrees of success. The conceptual model proposed in this paper situates theories of political economy and cultural studies within the landscape of theories of complexity, to illustrate that the source of the conflict between the two camps runs deeper than superficial territorial squabbles. The concept of emergence, as defined within the realm of complexity and adopted for the model, offers insight into the profound epistemological differences between political economy and cultural studies. Positions on emergence can also suggest new areas of inquiry suited to the strengths of each area of scholarship."

The results of this study support the general theory of motivated cognition underlying the limited capacity model for motivated message processing, with evidence of positivity offset and greater resource allocation to encoding for appetitive activation compared to aversive activation. The results also add to signal detection theory by suggesting that, for recognition judgments, criterion bias may be tracking available encoding resources."

In both experiments, participants watch the last 45 minutes of Alfred Hitchocks Rear Window . Half of the participants watched the movie in English and half watched in French with English subtitles. We expected participants to form fewer linkages between situation models in the subtitle condition due to the cognitive of reading subtitles which should interfere with the elaborations necessary to form linkages between the situation models. The first experiment examined the pattern of inferences generated during movie watching. The results showed that participants in the English condition made more backward inferences than participants in the subtitled condition which suggest that participants develop more associative links between situation models. In Experiment 2, after watching the last 45 minutes of the film, participants were asked to sort the 78 events into piles based on their similarity. The associated network that resulted from the similiarity data supported the results of Experiment 1 by showing that the representation of the movie involved more elaborative linkages when watched in English than in French with subtitles. The implication of these results from models of movie comprehension are discussed."

This study relied on the expertise of online journalists from Latin America, North America and Europe through their participation in three sets of online focus groups. In all the focus groups, the findings showed that online journalists perceive a comprised distance between themselves and the audience, although the desired extent of this closer interaction, as well as the reasoning behind it, varied. Secondly, as online journalists, they share commonalities in the technology resources they use for their daily news production that include acquisition devices, processing and distribution technologies. This study aims to serve as a foundation by which to explain how this online medium is evolving and how online journalists perform and operate within it."
2006-0267,Computer Mediated Communication Network: Exploring the Linkage Between Online Community and Social Capital,Growth of Online Communities,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Computer Mediated Communication Network: Exploring the Linkage Between Online Community and Social Capital,Growth of Online Communities,"This study attempts to explore how online communities work in the context of social capital through a survey of 344 Internet users. Specifically, this research investigates various factors of media use, social capital, and demographics that may have an influence on online community use. Although some argue that Internet use may erode an individuals social life, this study found that people who access the Internet for online community use tend to have more sociability and generalized norm than do online community non-users. When important socio-psychological factors of social capital, such as trust and life contentment were considered, however, social capital was not fully related to online community use. In this regard, it is suggested that online communities may enhance the communication ability of individuals due to technological advantages, but face-to-face communication in the form of traditional community is still essential to ensure the quality of community. In terms of media use, Internet use was a significant factor of online community use whereas traditional media was not related to online community use. Also, gender and race were significant factors of online community use among demographics."

In the field of communication, studies have focused on the negotiation of cultural identities from various ontological and epistemological perspectives and have conceptualized groups as ethnic, cultural, gender, or national. This article suggests using the concept of collective identity as an orienting framework to study interrelated and multidimensional group identities without reifying a group as ethnic or cultural. By applying the concept of collective identity to the study of group identities as expressed by people of Arab descent in the U.S. the study demonstrates the heterogeneity and interrelatedness of collective identities and their cultural, socio-political, and religious meaning dimensions. The study also shows that collective identity expression can be strategic and shift in importance, depending on the socio-political climate in society."

Media appears as a central actor in the global circulation of meanings and images of contemporaries. While the literature is divided between visions of homogeneity and heterogeneity, and complicated by how individuals, nations, civilizations, or humanity are conceptualized in a global culture, this essay suggested that a world community must commence from embracing heterogeneity as its chief project  and as its most obvious solution."
2006-0270,Conceptualizing Media Stimuli in Experimental Research: Psychological States Versus Media Stimuli,"Rethinking Concepts, Methods, and Modeling in Information Processing Research",Information Systems,,,Paper,Conceptualizing Media Stimuli in Experimental Research: Psychological States Versus Media Stimuli,"Rethinking Concepts, Methods, and Modeling in Information Processing Research","This paper argues for a clearer conceptualization of media stimuli in experimental research and identifies three issues impeding our understanding of message processing: (1) assumptions bolstered by manipulation checks about homogeneity of response to media stimuli; (2) the conflation of two different classes of variables  media attributes and psychological states; and, (3) discrepancies between the conceptual model and operational-level hypotheses in much media effects research. To address this situation, we suggest a clearer conceptual separation between message attributes and cognitive responses and introduce a general model to provide a more complete framework for investigating media effects. After providing an overview of the model, we subject it to three empirical tests and find an increase in explained variance in each instance."
2006-0271,Conditions Under Which Antismoking Campaigns Prevent Adolescent Ex-smokers Future Smoking,The Role of Parents in Health Communication Targeting Adolescents,Health Communication,,,Paper,Conditions Under Which Antismoking Campaigns Prevent Adolescent Ex-smokers Future Smoking,The Role of Parents in Health Communication Targeting Adolescents,"This study examines conditions under which antismoking campaigns prevent adolescent ex-smokers future smoking, with consideration of multiple risk and counter-risk factors of smoking. Using the 2004 National Tobacco Youth Survey data, analysis of tobit regression models reports that well-known behavioral, attitudinal, and environmental risk factors are indeed significant determinants of adolescent ex-smokers intention to smoke. By contrast, there is no main effect of antismoking campaigns on the participants intention to smoke. But the antismoking campaigns are effective only for high schoolers who reported higher levels of school training and parental discussion against smoking. The findings suggest that campaigners should consider all levels of antismoking efforts including interpersonal (e.g., school and parents) and mediated (e.g., media campaigns) sources and tailor antismoking programs to fit specific target audiences. Limitations of this study and implications for campaigners are further discussed."

However, there is limited literature available to guide media studies scholars through the process of conducting qualitative research with children. To address this gap in the literature, this essay reviews the considerations that arise in qualitative research with children at each stage of the research process: selecting a topic and approach, entering the field, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting results. The author draws upon a range of scholarly literature about qualitative research with adults and children, including scholarship from the fields of cultural studies, media literacy, sociology, education, and feminist ethnography. She also turns to insights garnered in the course of her own fieldwork, conducted as part of a feminist cultural studies project on girls' media use and identities."
2006-0273,"Conflict, Contingency and Continuum: A Conceptual Model of the Source-Reporter Relationship between Public Relations Professionals and Journalists",Journalists and Their Sources,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,"Conflict, Contingency and Continuum: A Conceptual Model of the Source-Reporter Relationship between Public Relations Professionals and Journalists",Journalists and Their Sources,"This study proposes a further research direction of the source-reporter relationship by integrating conflict and conflict resolution models from the field of conflict studies to the contingency theory in public relations. The conflict and conflict management models can be introduced to public relations to identify the relationship between an organization and a public. The organization-public relationship can be closely associated with the nature of conflict and the strategies of conflict resolution. The ultimate purpose of this study is to provide a theoretical framework for addressing the continuum of the conflictual and strategic source-reporter relationships between public relations practitioners and journalists as one instantiation of organization-public relationships. The proposed continuum model of source-reporter power relationships presented below depicts the relational, organizational and societal level of conflict in the source-reporter relationship between public relations practitioners and journalists."

The present study used the interactionist framework integrating situationalist model and trait model to explain a persons conformity and dissent behavior in an online group discussion. In other words, this research extended the literature on conformity behavior in CMC by showing that not only objective situational factors provided by computer media, but also a persons perception of the situation as well as his/her personality traits could contribute to his/her conformity decision. Moreover, this study proved the existence of the curvilinear relationship between the intensity of deindividuation created by computer media and group identity as well as conformity intention by using a persons perception of the situational deindividuation as the measure of the intensity of deindividuation. This finding empirically supports the optimal distinctiveness theory arguing that a persons conformity behavior is maximized when they perceive the moderate level of deindividuation from the situation in which they are located. The findings of this study further demonstrated that the curvilinear relationship between perceived deindividuation and conformity intention was moderated by the way people represented themselves with avatars and their need for uniqueness."

First, I address the notion of a central mission in development work, toward improving women's conditions and recognizing gender and feminist concerns. In the next section, I consider the position of women as a consequence of this process, in terms of their passive roles, valued in terms of their reproduction, sexuality, and victimization. Finally, I consider options, based in feminist critiques, toward confronting the missionary position of development programs targeting women."

Regular television news viewers were recruited from a midsize Designated Market Area using random digit dialing, and were randomly assigned to one of three science news exposure conditions. As hypothesized, science television news exposure appears to boost perceived ability to understand science. We also find that perceived ability to understand science, in turn, predicts conversations about science. We note connections to literature on the role of talk in mass communication effects and encourage future work in this vein."
2006-0277,Connecting with the News Through Affective Expectations: Antecedents and Outcomes,Advances in Research on News Effects II,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Connecting with the News Through Affective Expectations: Antecedents and Outcomes,Advances in Research on News Effects II,"Democratic theory affords journalism a central place in keeping the citizenry sufficiently informed. But people turn to the news with an expectation for affective stimulation rather than just orientational needs. This paper constructs measurement tools for two news expectations, affect and orientation, and associates them with antecedent social factors, consequent choices concerning news content and a preferred news source. The analysis is based on a large representative sample of the U.S. adult population. The findings here suggest that the degree to which people want their news to engage with them on an affective level, beyond orientation, is conditioned to some degree by social background: women more than men, nonwhites more than whites, those earning less and the older among the less-educated are looking at their news in search of more than just the facts. Those who have relatively less emotional expectations of the news will be more inclined to follow stories dealing with their nonimmediate world. As for the role of gratifications sought on news-media usage, the picture is less determinate, with the exception of local news consumption being positively impacted by affective news expectations."
2006-0278,Consequences of Perceived Effects: The Variable Perception-Behavior Linkage in the Third-Person Effects,Advances in Effects Research I,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Consequences of Perceived Effects: The Variable Perception-Behavior Linkage in the Third-Person Effects,Advances in Effects Research I,"Returning to Davisons original formulation of the third-person effect, this paper argues that TPE is a theoretical framework accounting for a particular process of media effects: that of behaviors in relation to the media conditioned by the biased perceptions about media effects. Behavioral consequences of the third-person perceptions must be explicated more carefully in terms of those targeted at or about the media messages in question. Analyzing data from a web-based survey, this paper shows that self-other perceptual gaps vary across messages with desirable or undesirable presumed influences; such gaps predict inclinations to engage in restrictive or corrective behaviors with regard to the messages of undesirable influences and promotional behaviors with regard to the messages of desirable influences. In addition, behavioral consequences are related to different elements of the lay theories about media effects called media effect schemas. This study also shows that perceived effects on self vs. on other have different behavioral consequences. Implications for future TPE studies are discussed."
2006-0279,Consider the Source: Predictors of Online Citation Permanence in Communication Journals,Explorations of Cyberspace,Theme Sessions,,,Paper,Consider the Source: Predictors of Online Citation Permanence in Communication Journals,Explorations of Cyberspace,This study focuses on six leading communication journals and their use of online citations. The study uses content analysis to explore if there is a relationship between citation characteristics and their stability. The findings show that online citations in the .gov and .org domain are more likely to remain accessible over time. Year of publication and URL level also emerged as significant predictors of online citation permanence. More than 37% of the online citations have disappeared from the original source from 2000 to 2003. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of communication research reliability and replicability.
2006-0280,Consider This: A Comparison of Factors Contributing to Expressions of Employee Dissent,Organizational Impacts on Employee Voice,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Consider This: A Comparison of Factors Contributing to Expressions of Employee Dissent,Organizational Impacts on Employee Voice,"In this study full-time employees reported via a survey instrument about the degree to which certain considerations factored into their decisions to express upward or lateral dissent. Results indicated that employees rated considerations similarly when dissenting to either supervisors or coworkers with issue importance and employee satisfaction being reported as the strongest considerations and concerns about being perceived as adversarial as the weakest consideration. A comparison across types of dissent revealed that respondents reported generally more consideration of various factors when expressing upward dissent, but reported only significantly more consideration of relationship quality with coworkers when expressing lateral dissent. Additionally, results suggested no significant differences in the way management and nonmanagement employees weighed considerations when expressing upward or lateral dissent."

International news sources have tremendous impact on U.S. politics because they have their political agendas seeking to influence domestic political climate.
The present research aims to construct a theoretical framework using the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a case study. Findings of the study could provide some insight into the complicated processes of selection of news sources, especially in the highly influential world affairs and conflicts. It is also pragmatically important as it would allow policy-makers to evaluate and execute necessary foreign policy."

In the process of news making, journalists give meaning to political events through selection and interpretation. Taking this into consideration, this paper describes an exploration into the construction of political news during the 2002 Dutch national election. To that end, 8 journalists working for 3 daily newspapers were followed during, and interviewed about, their daily journalistic activities. The results of this qualitative study indicated that the situational context, specified by the hierarchically-structured production process in the news room, as well as the political-journalistic arena, influenced the news-making process. Furthermore, the professional knowledge which journalists use to interpret and define daily political situations can be categorized using five different meaning schemes: the factual, the organisational, the political, the journalistic and the individual meaning scheme. The often routinely structured use of these meaning schemes became particularly clear through the news-making process that surrounded the upcoming politician Pim Fortuyn and his political party."

Data obtained through content and textual analyses show that whereas Korean Americans are typically described as victims, Blacks are most commonly portrayed as villains, followed by Latinos and Whites. Asian Americans are frequently described as economic rivals and cultural/political partners. Blacks are highly overrepresented in crime news. Latinos are more likely to be depicted as low-wage laborers who work for Korean American owners. Whites are usually represented as racists, benefactors, or partners. Compared with Blacks and Asian Americans, Whites and Latinos evenly appear in diverse news categories of the Korean-language newspaper. In addition, Whites and Latinos are frequently mentioned in the column/opinion sections due to their frequent involvement with Korean Americans everyday lives."

The analysis focuses on two central questions: Who appears in the media & how are the actors constructed? What self-image is implicitly communicated? One hypothesis is that Arab or Islamic actors are constructed as geographical, cultural or political others. This construction draws an in-group definition for the self via the othering of characteristics that are ascribed to the Arab or Islamic actors. The created image can implicitly serve as an identification platform for the reader as an in-group member. The Arab or Islamic other portrays the behavior or characteristics that deviate from socially favored norms and values. By doing what is not preferred or allowed the other actors help the society (i.e. the self) to remind itself of these norms and of what its own national or trans-national, Western identity is based upon. The analysis covers 8 weeks before and 4 weeks after the event and includes 6 print media. The paper introduces four of the major types of actors and illustrates them with a few examples."

This is accomplished by way of a historical perspective on the journalistic field as a whole, mapping out the area of royal reporting as consisting of a mixture of genres. Historic study of court journalism invites a number of research questions:
- What can be revealed about the relations between the media as fourth (in Sweden, third) estate and royalty as representatives of the nation?
- How is Swedish national identity constructed and positioned in relation to other national identities through the voices of court journalism?
- Which kinds of gendered identities are ascribed to (or prescribed for) the royals?
- Where are media audiences positioned  as royal subjects or as media consumers?
- What positions do journalists occupy  are they superior, inferior or equal to the royals?
- How is power distributed between the royals, the media and the audience?
- What are the possible cultural meanings of medias representations of royalty?"

This is an exploratory study that focuses on the attitude towards cell phone, cell phone advertising and SMS ads. This study also investigates consumer behavior in accepting and using cell phone ads. Survey method was used, and the questionnaire was answered through in-class and take-home survey. This study finds that respondents attitude toward both general cell phone ads and SMS ads was negative. However their attitude toward the cell phone medium was very positive. The result shows that the individuals who had more positive attitude toward cell phone ads were more receptive to accept and use cell phone ads."

The aim of this paper is to examine the news seeking behavior of the online news audience. The paper attempts to put the study into the context of digital society and link the online audience with the online medium format and Net user characteristics. Since online news audience adopts a purposive news seeking mode to locate news they want to read, this paper tries to identify the key elements in their online news consumption. Findings indicate that the online news seeking mode is characterized by convenient search, timely search, pick and choose (selective search), target search, non-linear reading and comparative reading. Online audiences news seeking behavior is affected by the Net users characteristics and the open format of the online news media. Three types of online news readers are identified, namely demanding readers, pragmatic readers and casual readers."

How does a euphemisms displacement capacity change over its career in the vernacular? Linguists have assumed that this capacity deteriorates as euphemisms become conventional and thus contaminated by their association with negative referents. In contrast, communication research suggests that conventionality may confer camouflage-like properties to euphemisms, enabling addressees to process them in a mindless fashion. We report two studies investigating these divergent theoretical accounts. Study 1 explored the relationship between perceptions of euphemisms familiarity and politeness. Study 2 examined the attributional consequences of familiar and novel euphemistic encodings of a taboo topic. Our results contradict the associative contamination hypothesis and comport with the camouflage hypothesis."

This study takes a different approach to identifying views by considering the magazine an alternative perspective from mainstream press and other lifestyle and entertainment magazines, not catering to Hispanic/Latino markets. Findings indicate that Hispanic Magazine, as an ethnic-minority press has social commentary on the presence of Hispanic/Latinos in the television industry and whether issues related to representations improved over time. This content analysis offers insight into the magazines focus on a variety of topics, mainly related to personalities and/or programs in terms of success, being new, trying to attract Hispanic/Latino viewers, as well as the diversity and accuracy of portrayals."

Their analysis may thus be conceived as a public opinion survey in a qualitatively unobtrusive fashion. The present study analyzed LEs published in a prestigious daily during the first half of 2003 in order to delve into the recent crisis of the hegemonic status of Ashkenazi elites in Israel. It was hypothesized that letter writers would ventilate anxieties due to their threatened positionality. However, in spite of the elitist profile of the writers, most letters dealt with national questions, particularly the Israel-Arab conflict. Moreover, writers clearly demarcate a cohesive in-group of all Israeli Jews, disregarding internal schisms. Arabs are perceived to be the ultimate out-group: They are constructed as an archetypal enemy."

I delineate this counterintuitive consequence of contextomy as it pertains to recent political efforts to eliminate affirmative action programs."

Limitations and future research suggestions are also discussed.
2006-0310,"Contextualism, Semantic Minimalism, and Communication","Discourse, Dialogue, and Ethics in New Contextual Frameworks",Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,"Contextualism, Semantic Minimalism, and Communication","Discourse, Dialogue, and Ethics in New Contextual Frameworks","We can identify two distinct roles performed by natural languages, the cognitive and the communicative. But they are interlocked: linguistically encoded knowledge can be immediately communicated, and there is no linguistic communication without information transmission.
The two most influential trends in the current philosophic research on natural language, Contextualism (Charles Travis, François Recanati and others) and Semantic Minimalism (Cappelen, Lepore and others), confirm this centrality of communication.
Contextualist conception of communication is the idea that the mere literal meaning of a sentence does not correspond to a complete proposition with truth conditions that determines the meaning of each of the sentences utterances. In a communicative situation, in order to obtain an appropriate linguistic understanding of the uttered sentence, a series of contextual and background knowledge must be invoked to assign a determinate meaning to the uttered words, this will give us what is said. Further inferential work can be needed in order to sort out what was implicated by what was said, i.e., what was communicated.
Semantic Minimalism assumes and articulates two ideas: first the fundamental claim that, contrary to what Contextualism assume, genuine utterances of a sentence share a minimal semantic content: the proposition semantically expressed; second, the claim that an utterance communicates indefinitely many propositions (and not just one as assumed by Contextualism).
In this paper I will access this Contextualism/Minimalism on the explanation of linguistic communication, and try to sort out which of the two views provides a better account of it."

The survey revealed that religious public relations practitioners place high value on ethical and moral convictions. However, practitioners admitted that their normative sense is often constrained by the interests of management, particularly in a conflict or a crisis. Religious public relations practitioners reported that they are more likely to employ collaborating, contending or comprising rather than accommodating or avoiding in a conflict. When it comes to a crisis, religious public relations practitioners are more likely to use more flexible or amenable tactics such as concession, corrective action or responsibility evading strategies than firm or coerced tactics such as denial, shifting the blame or reducing offensiveness strategies. Religious public relations practitioners suggest that they believe themselves to be are under the same organizational umbrella as their management. Specifically, a conflict or crisis brings their practice into it depends situations."

A mixed 2 Target Behavior (Smoking/Non-Smoking) X 2 Type of Effect (Self/Average Person) X 6 (Order of Presentation) X 2 Appeal (Social/Fear) X 2 Pacing (Slow/Fast Camera Changes) X 3 Message Complexity (Low/Medium/High Information Introduced) multi-factorial design with the Between-subjects factors of Behavior, Type of Effect, and Order of Presentation, and the Within-Subjects factors of Appeal, Pacing, and Message Complexity will be used to examine the impact of these factors on continuous response assessments of the PSAs. Message complexity and type of appeal will be manipulated to determine whether a) increasing the cognitive and emotional demands on viewers increases perceived effects on self; b) increasing cognitive and emotional demands also increases perceived effects on others and, if so, whether this increase is as extensive as the increase in perceived effects on self; c) the extent to which these factors differ in their effects on smokers and non-smokers continuous response ratings and post-exposure judgments concerning perceived effects of anti-smoking messages on self and others; and d) the relationship between these factors and perceived message credibility, valence, arousal, and dominance."

The study used a five-dimensional conceptualization of interactivity to understand the governments nuanced channeling of public discourse within legally regulated channels. Results indicate that while these channels provide more transparency between government and citizenry, they limit users to social and economic justice issues through a predominance of asynchronous interactivity, which links into a myriad of legal, technical and social measures to contain the political impact of the Internet."

This narrative chronicles and analyzes the confluence of three concurrent movements: broadcast program censorship policies in the late 1920s and early 1930s, splits in feminist ranks over what womens birth control rights should be publicly advocated, and general fears that womens power over their own lives would have a detrimental affect on patriarchy, family values and the traditional family structure. This paper specifically reviews how the major company involved in broadcasting  the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), which owned and operated two networks  framed the issue of contraception to keep the contentious issue off their networks airwaves. Most other broadcasters followed NBCs lead, and the strategies they developed collectively became the underpinning for controlling non-dominant, controversial issues presented over radio."
2006-0315,Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications,Regulating Communication Networks,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications,Regulating Communication Networks,"Drawing a lesson from current convergence technologies, this paper proposes the future regulatory framework for telecommunications. As new convergence technologies have significantly impact on the telecom industry and regulators, a debate continues to grow over how the convergence technology fits into the traditional telecommunications regulation and industrial schemes. Internet telephony has sparked a regulatory debate on whether it is phone call service or information service: that is, whether or not Internet telephony traffic should be subjected to any or all of the various common carrier regulations. A similar series of legal questions will arise in the emerging convergence technologies: whether mobile TV is broadcasting or telecommunications; whether IPTV is information service or broadcasting? Currently FCC is taking a hands-off approach to the convergence technologies in the hope to let the premature technologies grow. However, the provisional approaches leave much room for debates on regulating other upcoming convergence services. This paper reviews the nature of these debates, outlines the challenges faced by regulators, discusses the current regulatory models, and offers a new praxis that will be appropriate in the next generation of networks."

Some have argued that the use of the local media furthers integration. Others have seen integration into a community as a prerequisite for attention to the media. To answer this still open question, a survey has been conducted. It explored whether a relationship between both dimensions actually exists and whether personal conversations about the media could actually link both phenomena. Our data show that social integration is not only related to media use, but also to conversations specifically about the media. Thus, the medias contribution to community integration could consist of their potential to facilitate conversations and to integrate individuals socially through conversational topics."
2006-0317,Cop Action Women: Hollywood Depictions of Women in Mens Occupational Turf,Popular Communication and Gender,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Cop Action Women: Hollywood Depictions of Women in Mens Occupational Turf,Popular Communication and Gender,"Content analysis of 290 cop action films (produced in the U.S. and released between 1968 and 2005) reveals patterns in the gendering of occupational heroism. Hollywood depicts violent police work as male occupational turf, and female heroes as newcomers to it. Differences in the depictions of male and female heroes suggest popular conceptions of women who enter traditionally male-dominated workplaces. Patterns that leave heroes alienated from normal life are constant across lines of gender, but the patterns that make cops more heroic (their skills and effectiveness at stopping criminals) are not. Women tend to suffer by comparison to male cops in these respects, because they are more distracted from their work by the demands of romantic lives. Intensive genre study shows that women working a traditionally male-dominated job enjoy less status, though their presence there no longer constitutes a surprise."
2006-0318,Coping with Problematic Relationships in the Workplace: Strategies That Reduce Burnout,Organizing Emotions,Organizational Communication,,,Poster,Coping with Problematic Relationships in the Workplace: Strategies That Reduce Burnout,Organizing Emotions,"Problematic relationships are prevalent in the workplace (Omdahl and Fritz, in press), and research has demonstrated a positive relationships between the proportion of negative work relationships and burnout (Omdahl and Fritz, in press). Theories of stress suggest that different employees may appraise the stress arising from problematic work relationships in different ways and employ different types of coping strategies. Research by Lazarus and Folkman (1984, 1987) indicates that some coping strategies are more effective than others at averting burnout. This study was designed to examine whether: 1) the finding that problematic work relationships contribute to the three stages of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, Maslach, 1982) could be replicated; and 2) the strategies of problem solving and reappraisal strategies are more effective than other coping strategies (viz., maintaining control, confronting, distancing, seeking social support, accepting responsibility, and escaping) in preventing burnout in the face of ongoing problematic relationships in the workplace.
Eighty participants completed diaries about problematic relationships in the workplace for twelve weeks. At monthly intervals, they also completed questionnaires containing items addressing coping strategies and burnout. The results revealed strong correlations between the proportion of work relationships which were negative and burnout. In addition, problem solving and reappraisal were the only coping strategies significantly negatively correlated with all three stages of burnout. [We plan to complete repeated measure data analysis before the convention presentation.]"
2006-0319,Corporate Communications and Reputation Building,Advances in Advertising Research I,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Corporate Communications and Reputation Building,Advances in Advertising Research I,"A growing number of studies have argued that good corporate reputations have strategic value for the firms that possess them. Although there are many factors to influence a corporate reputation, marketing communications have been regarded as the foremost reputation-building activities to develop and improve firms reputation. Very little research, however, has explored the dynamics of marketing communications and corporate reputation and their reputational consequences. Therefore, the present study will explore how advertising and public relations affect corporate reputation and how its reputation influences the corporate bottom-line corporate. Companies included in Fortunes 2004 Reputation survey were used for this study. All data (advertising expenditures, the number of news article about a firm, corporate reputation, and corporate revenue) included in this study are the firm level data. The findings of this study indicate that advertising and public relations generate corporate reputation and corporate reputation influence corporate revenue which improve corporate profitability."
2006-0320,Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Public Relations: Perceptions and Practices in Singapore,Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Relations,Public Relations,,,Paper,Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Public Relations: Perceptions and Practices in Singapore,Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Relations,"This study explored the perceptions about corporate social responsibility (CSR) among a sample of corporate executives (512) and the CSR practices of a sample of corporations (74) in Singapore. A web-based survey and personal interviews were the primary methods of data gathering. The study tried to assess the activities, motivations, decision-making processes, stakeholders, communication processes, resource allocation, evaluation, and benefits of CSR among the sample corporations in Singapore.
Our findings revealed that while the sample corporate executives were able to define the concept of CSR comprehensively, identifying a range of parameters and stakeholders pertaining to CSR, actual practice tended to revolve around the philanthropic dimension. The sample corporations were motivated by different factors to practice CSR, which we saw as being driven by either a proactive, accommodative, or reactive approach. We also discovered that the lack of commitment among some corporations to evaluating CSR practices might have been because these corporations did not establish CSR goals in the first place.
Based on our findings, as well as our literature review, we offer a framework to evaluate how different stakeholders (whom we refer to as drivers) can help promote CSR in Singapore. We evaluated the effectiveness of these drivers based on their potential impact on corporations and their current activity level pertaining to CSR, and assessed their strengths and weaknesses. While we identified the government and the corporations to be in the best position to raise CSR awareness and performance, other drivers can collaborate to increase their individual effectiveness."
2006-0321,Corporate Sustainability Communications: Aspects of Theory and Professionalization,Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Relations,Public Relations,,,Paper,Corporate Sustainability Communications: Aspects of Theory and Professionalization,Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Relations,"Introduced in the so-called Brundtland Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987, the concept of sustainable development was defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. On the company level, implementing sustainability requires not only the support of top management, but also inputs from and networking of several other corporate systems such as legal, human resources and also communication management.

The aim of this paper is to frame the role of communication in corporate sustainability processes. In the first two chapters, the wider approach of corporate sustainability and the concept of corporate sustainability communications (CSC) will be introduced. CSC will be defined as an evolving concept which refers to corporate communications about the topic of sustainability. At present, two aspects appear to be of particular relevance for theory and practice of corporate sustainability communications, namely theoretical considerations and professionalization. In chapter 3, conceptual linkages to recent theoretical approaches to public relations are established, especially societal ones. Chapter 4 focuses on professionalization in corporate sustainability communications which, considering the increasing number of sustainability reports published, appears to be a growing field of action for communication experts. Reproaches notwithstanding that public relations practitioners would be prone to misuse CSC to do greenwashing, the authors are of the opinion that they do have the best qualifications to communicate sustainability issues which are characterized by high complexity and recognizable potential for conflict."

The relational turbulence model (Solomon & Knobloch, 2004) highlights how intimacy, relational uncertainty, and interference from partners influence and reflect reactions to events that occur within romantic relationships. Drawing from the theory, we predicted that (a) relational uncertainty and interference from partners are positively associated with cognitive and emotional jealousy; (b) the intensity of romantic jealousy, relational intimacy, and a partners interference are positively associated with the directness of communication about jealousy; (c) relational uncertainty is negatively associated with communicative directness; and (d) cognitive jealousy, emotional jealousy, and the directness of communicative responses to jealousy influence subsequent relationship characteristics. The results of hierarchical linear modeling revealed mixed support for our predictions. We explore the implications of this study for the relational turbulence model, relationship development, and jealousy research."

Furthermore, the coverage it does receive tends to focus mostly on negative events, such as crime, poverty and unemployment (Avraham, 2000). This study explores whether these differences exist even when one focuses on newsworthy and negative events, such as terrorist attacks. To answer this question we content analyzed news coverage of all terrorist attacks that had taken place in Israel in 2002 in two national newspapers: Yediot Achronot and Haaretz. Findings show that terrorist attacks in the center of Israel tend to be reported in more prominent locations in both papers than terrorist attacks in the periphery. Furthermore, both papers devote more space to terrorist attacks that take place in the center of the country. Newspaper coverage of terrorist attacks in the center also tends to include pictures and to utilize color more often than coverage of terrorist attacks in the periphery. These differences remain significant even when controlling for a variety of factors including the number of casualties and the type of attack."

Objectivity standards were tested using textual analysis of news coverage of the 2005 Iraqi national elections by two news organizations claiming to adhere to standards of journalistic objectivity, the New York Times and Al-Jazeera. Data from 63 articles about the Iraqi national elections by Al-Jazeera and the New York Times were collected and analyzed. The findings indicate that both news organizations achieved many standards of journalistic objectivity, while still presenting cultural perspectives and values particular to their audiences."
2006-0327,Covering the Bosnian War: Journalism of Attachment in Dutch Newspapers,Journalism in Times of War,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Covering the Bosnian War: Journalism of Attachment in Dutch Newspapers,Journalism in Times of War,"The civil war in the former Yugoslavia, and especially in Bosnia, was one of the most brutal periods in European post-war history. Dutch media played an important role in creating a rather stereotypical, simplified picture of the Bosnian conflict, and, as a consequence, also of what the international community, the Netherlands in particular, could do to bring it to an end and solve it.
The reasons why the media created this simplified and stereotypical picture can be found in the phenomenon of journalism of attachment. Coined by BBCs former correspondent Martin Bell, journalism of attachment agrees that reporters are participants in the conflicts they report, and as a consequence take part in the public debate about the conflict. Using a content analysis of the news coverage about the Bosnian war, we investigated in this study the extent to which the phenomenon of journalism of attachment occurred in Dutch newspapers and the consequences of this phenomenon for the quality of the news in terms of objectivity. We found that journalists covering the Bosnian war played a leading role in the public debate. They violated the Western ideal of journalistic performance. They adopted the role of heroic fighter for the oppressed rather than impartial mediator between the events and the audience. This tendency is especially seen in the news coverage of the left-wing newspaper de Volkskrant, and in a more subtle way, through the use of opportune witnesses, also in the intellectual newspaper NRC Handelsblad."

Another way to express this conundrum is: how does China move from a preoccupation with the national management of culture to the internationalisation of its cultural industries? How can Chinese cultural products compete with their East Asian counterparts in regional and international markets? What role does China play in the pan-Asian cultural marketplace? Is it a follower or a leader?"
2006-0329,Creative Commons: Legitimizing User-Based Global Cultural Exchange over the Internet,The Creative Commons on the Internet,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Creative Commons: Legitimizing User-Based Global Cultural Exchange over the Internet,The Creative Commons on the Internet,"Creative Commons represents an emerging technological and legal mechanism for flexible copyright protection to authors and artists such that their creative works can be more freely distributed and re-mixed worldwide. The Creative Commons project seeks to institute an alternative content licensing framework by developing worldwide jurisdiction specific licenses according to existing intellectual property regimes within nation states. CC licenses have been completed in over 24 nations  from Austria to Brazil to China.

This paper situates Creative Commons within the context of cultural globalization by examining the extent to which the CC project challenges the global flow of cultural products. The status quo is marked by an industrial system concentrated among a few large transnational media firms, which rely on a delicate technological and legal framework to control both production resources and global distribution networks.

Alternatively, Creative Commons is modeled around remix practices and Internet culture  production is user based and collective; distribution is decentralized. While the Internet is already changing the way music is distributed and consumed, the CC license purports to facilitate a fundamental change in the way music is created in a global and networked society. Using music as a particular case, I administered questionnaires from a high profile group the first users of Creative Commons. Based on this data, I argue that CC is best understood as a legitimizing tool for emerging technological practices of cultural creativity on the Internet."

Five-hundred-and-five randomly selected adults over the age of 18 in Indiana were interviewed. Regression analyses indicate significant variance across media genres and channels in their influence on viewer orientations to crime. Yet overall, media use is a relatively weak predictor of crime orientations."

Both organizations had to address their constituents and assure them that this was an isolated event. Based on an analysis of the crisis rhetoric responses by both Merck and the FDA, it is apparent that the two organizations addressed different audiences and used different strategies to address those audiences. Specifically, the authors found the Merck emphasized ingratiation, acknowledgment, and institutional characteristics, while the FDA addressed institutional characteristics without either acknowledgment or denial. The significance of these findings are discussed."

Plenty of empirical data indicate that there is a growing resentment against the US not only but very obviously in Europe. From the perspective of communication studies, it can be assumed that the media play a fundamental role in spreading and establishing such stereotypes and preconceptions. In particular media dependency and cultivation effects can be expected. The authors conducted a survey to clarify how the use of the media affects relations between Germans and the USA as well as how it affects the spread of anti-American stereotypes.
The results show that the tendency is towards a negative stereotypical image of the USA by the Germans. Furthermore anti-Americanism seems to be an elite attitude, as people with higher education and higher political interest tend to agree with negative stereotypes more frequently. The assumption that such stereotypical images are shaped by the media can be confirmed, even if the detailed results are somewhat different than originally assumed."

2006-0355,Cult of the Signers: Autographmania and the Popular Imagination in Nineteenth-Century America,The Popular in Perspective,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Cult of the Signers: Autographmania and the Popular Imagination in Nineteenth-Century America,The Popular in Perspective,"During the early nineteenth century a curious passion for autograph collecting swept through the United States. American antiquarians of all stripes sought out the signatures of noted figures, from literary celebrities to generals and clergymen. However, autographs belonging to the signers of the Declaration of Independenceand collections bringing together the signatures of all fifty-sixsoon emerged as the most rarified in the pantheon of American collecting. This autographmania, and the importance of the Signers in particular, raises interesting questions about the nature of the autograph as a material artifact and social mnemonic in the popular imagination. What is the special significance of the handwritten signature? How do autographs embody and evoke the presence of the past? Or, drawing upon a concept introduced by Pierre Nora, how do autographs exist as sites of memory? The intersection of autograph collecting and the Declaration of Independence provides fertile terrain for exploring the memorial dimension of the signature and its role in the construction of popular memory. The Declaration is perhaps the most conspicuous display of signatory power in American history and the cult of the Signers, as it emerged during the 1820s, reflected mounting popular interest in documenting and preserving the nations originary past in its most real and authentic state."
2006-0356,Cultural Convergence in the Creative Industries: Understanding the Changing Nature of Media Work,The Creative Commons on the Internet,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Cultural Convergence in the Creative Industries: Understanding the Changing Nature of Media Work,The Creative Commons on the Internet,"This paper maps the emerging practices in media professions like journalism, advertising, marketing communications, and public relations as they adapt themselves to a new media environment. Among creatives and brand managers in ad agencies interactive advertising is at the center of the contemporary buzz. Marketers in the cultural industries brainstorm about the potential of upstream marketing, while in public relations the opportunities of two-way symmetrical communication are explored. Editors of news publications increasingly jump on the citizen journalism bandwagon. Among business professionals understanding and managing consumer-generated media is considered critical to commercial survival. All these trends are part of the same phenomenon: the cultural convergence of media production and consumption. Where media, communication and journalism studies traditionally differentiate between audience and reception research or production and industry analyses, a third approach dissolves this distinction and treats making media and using media as essentially the same praxis. In this essay, these developments are discussed in terms of their potential impact on consensual assumptions about the nature of media work, seen through the lens of the combination of individual creativity and mass production, also known as creative industries."

Korean students clearly differentiated themselves from one year older or younger students. They agreed that one year difference between college students made a big difference, and thought the one year younger should show respect and use formal languages to the one year older. They also felt that the one year older should show respect to the one year younger. American students thought differences in experiences was more important than age differences. This study proposed an alternative way of explaining cultural differences in the conception of age: relativity in perception, cognition, and behavior. The reason Koreans showed higher sensitivity to age differences was due to their strong tendency of seeing, thinking, and acting relatively. The findings that Korean students felt that they had to be respectful towards the one year younger can be better explained by relativity than the collectivism-individualism distinction."

First, it is explored to what extent the explosive growth of international cultural traffic in the second half of the twentieth century has been accompanied by increased news-paper coverage of foreign arts and culture in the four countries under study. Second, the paper examines the as-sumption that the degree and direction of international orientation differs significantly along the four countries and particular cultural areas, according to their size and the centrality of their domestic production in these areas. Thirdly, the paper qualifies the evolving patterns of dominance in the international orientation of arts journalism in each country, in terms of the geographical origin of the foreign artists and products reviewed."

A major incentive for creating alliances is the chance to learn from partner firms. There are a number of major factors that influence learning and knowledge transfer among international cooperative ventures and international joint ventures, among which cultural factors are especially important for the cross-organizational learning among strategic alliances that are not of the same national origin, for cultural distance could easily add to the difficulties and challenges in the learning and knowledge transfer process (Simonin, 1999; Hamel, 1991). This paper examines how cultural factors could promote or hinder the interorganizational learning efforts, and four propositions are developed on the relationship between cultural determinants and alliance partner knowledge transfer."

Using a theoretical foundation derived from the works of Hall (1980a, 1997) and Hofstede (1979), a theme analysis was conducted of broadcast television news and print news. Results indicate that the news media in Sweden presented a very different picture of the Iraq war as compared to the news media in the U.S. was represented differently in the two countries, simply by emphasizing different aspects. In the U.S., the war was described in terms of strategy, interpreted via a perspective from inside the American troops, and explained as the United States bringing freedom to the Iraqi people. Swedish media interpreted the war from a perspective of the international community and from Iraqi civilians point of view. They portrayed the war in terms of suffering civilians and explained it as a failure of the international community. As hypothesized, American media had comparatively more masculine content, while Swedish media had comparatively more feminine content. Implications of this study for future research on news media portrayals of international events are discussed."

This paper will try to complement current work in the field by suggesting a new operationalization derived from Hofstedes (1991) cultural dimensions. He defined four different cultural dimensions that are based on work and life values: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism/collectivism and masculinity/femininity. A survey was conducted in eight countries with a student sample (N = 325) to find out if international audiences, which resemble each other in terms of Hofstedes (1991) cultural dimensions, have similar attitudes towards television entertainment. It was asked if either common operationalizations such as geographical distance or Hofstedes cultural dimensions work better to indicate cultural proximity. The results show that Hofstedes four cultural dimensions significantly differentiate between the U.S.A., Asian and European countries in a student population. However, operationalizations based on geographical distance allow a better differentiation between cultures in terms of how they evaluate TV entertainment. It will be discussed if cultural dimensions in general are able to measure cultural proximity and if it makes sense to complement the current understanding and operationalizations in this respect."

The results of the experiment showed that the independent self-construal group tended to rate low graphic web sites more positively than the interdependent self-construal group, and it took less time to complete tasks in low graphic web sites than in high graphic web sites. However, even though the independent self-construal group was more likely to evaluate high interactive web sites favorably than the interdependent self-construal group, evidence that the independent self-construal group would be more competent in completing tasks in high interactive web sties than the interdependent self-construal group was not found. Although some findings have shown that traditional cross-cultural differences are still valid in distinguishing between different perceptions and behaviors online, others were interpreted as indigenous social issues and the technical progression of the Internet."

by the academic community in the 1983 Journal of Communication issue on Ferment in the Field. Twenty years later, the division still exists between those utilizing a cultural studies approach to media studies and those insisting on quantitative empirical approaches to the same. This paper addresses how one quantitatively empirically based theory, cultivation theory, compliments cultural studies in investigating how the media shapes social conceptions of reality. The overlap of assumptions shared by cultivation theory and cultural studies are presented to show complimentary perspectives that can be utilized for a more complete and more compelling argument of societal implications of mass media effects.
Cultural studies and cultivation theory dovetail in postulating that there is a dominant group presenting concepts of social reality through mass media content to a subordinate group or the general public, who in turn adopt the hegemonic construction of social reality. Furthermore, both cultivation theory and cultural studies adopt a critical perspective of the media as presenting distorted and erroneous realities that have negative implications for marginalized groups."

I find that religious traditions and political histories have significantly affected the quality of governance and legal environment, and have consequently shaped the development, modernization and restructuring of large telecommunications systems. The findings indicate that slower growth of horizontal communications in predominantly Orthodox and Muslim societies of CEE can be partly attributed to their religious and historical heritage. I suggest that this pattern of communications underdevelopment has slowed down their political and economic progress, especially when compared to the progress made by the neighboring Catholic and Protestant countries."

By the late 1950 many countries in Asia became politically independent and actively sought the development of their own nations. Decision makers in these countries became more involved with promoting policies that would stabilize and protect their political systems and improve the living standards of their citizens. Contrary to the above statements Islam does not give full political participation to women because of old traditional religious reasons. Religious interpretations with traditional values have given what seem to be convincing justification for the limited role of women in politics and involvement in decision making. This paper examines the compatibility of Islam and the extension of womens rights, an element of democratization, with attention to social complexities within Muslim societies and religious distinctions within Islam."
2006-0366,Cupid Alliances: Exploring Behavior Dynamics During Alliance Formation Between Unembedded Firms,dentification Processes in Organizational Networks,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Cupid Alliances: Exploring Behavior Dynamics During Alliance Formation Between Unembedded Firms,Identification Processes in Organizational Networks,"This paper explores the development of interpersonal and interorganizational trust in multiparty alliances where potential partners with no prior alliance ties are shot by a cupid organization. These relationships are considered in the context of both the networks in which each of the actors are embedded, as well as the resource dependencies which may be motivating the relationship. Preliminary findings from network data analysis of a case study suggest that prior network ties impact initial levels of trust and embeddedness. More surprising is the finding that although the firms chose to enter the alliance, levels of trust between partners with no prior network ties did not increase, and actually decreased over the course of the negotiation period. This seems to warrant further research into the role that resource dependencies and rewards exogenous to an alliance play in the development of trust and the ultimate formation of alliances."

In particular, the co-joined emergence of increasingly sophisticated communicative tactics of digital surveillance (dataveillance), and the structuring of the war on terrorism around discourses of security as a justification for an indefinite etat dexception, illustrate the manner in which Agambens concepts of sovereignty are inherent within post-enlightenment, neoliberal nation-states. Indeed, when placed within Agambens analytic framework, we may see how the war on terror provides the same political resolution to the inherent contradictions of the liberal state in an age of emergent digital communication technologies that the camps provided Nazi Germany in an age of emergent medical science. This paper offers the beginning of an analysis of how the differing articulations of the ever-present space of the zone of exception, and the ever-present character of homo sacer in Nazi Germany, and early 21st century US may potentially be traced in large part to the leading technologies of biopolitics of each respective era, and particularly to the information and communication technologies upon which contemporary data surveillance are based."

The outcomes anticipated often pertain to the relevance of the message to secondary goals such as presenting oneself in a positive light or not offending the other. On the basis of anticipated outcomes, speakers decide whether to say the message, edit it, or not say it. This study asks whether the magnitude of the negative relationship between anticipated conflict with a particular secondary goal and perceived message acceptability depends on the primary goal being pursued. The results suggest that the importance of secondary goals and the relative weight of perceived conflict with a secondary goal in determining message acceptability depend on the primary goal pursued."

Mid-level editors  those charged with the practical aspects of choosing, justifying, editing, and publishing the news  were surveyed about the personal values underlying their decision-making.

In general, the editors follow journalistic and audience values to make decisions and somewhat downplay the social and organizational influences. But group differences arose: Women are more likely than men to make decisions based on social, journalistic, and audience values; non-white editors are more likely than White editors to use organizational values; older editors significantly rely more on organizational values than their younger counterparts. More liberal editors relied more on social values, while conservative editors significantly relied more on organizational values. Education level showed no significant difference, but professional training background did; further investigation showed that editors with management or business trainings were more likely to depend on organizational values to make decisions. In addition, circulation size, and staff size determined whether an editor uses organizational influences.

The study raises questions about the role of values in newsroom decision-making and, thus, the role of perceptions when it comes to managing. The authors suggest media management scholars need to give greater focus to individual values and that the American newspaper industry may want to look more closely at the demographics, training and experiences of its mid-level managers before any attempt is made to transform newsroom culture."

In late twentieth century societies, the ways in which actors in the cultural field classify the supply of arts and culture and develop corresponding rules of behavior and practices  seem to have undergone significant changes, which seem closely connected to wider (intra and inter) societal developments. The paper examines the hierarchical dimension of such classification systems and considers the alleged erosion of traditional cultural hierarchies across time and across countries. This will be achieved by means of a comparative study of newspaper coverage of arts and culture in four different countries  France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States  in the period 1955-1995. The countries under investigation are expected to differ substantially, due to variations in cultural tradition, market orientation, commercialization, social mobility, and state intervention. The paper presents an empirical analysis of cross-national variations in the amount of newspaper coverage given to high and popular cultural forms."

Analyses of the overall trend of defamation litigation against the media and the sociological questions in terms of plaintiffs and defendant success reveal that it is oversimplifying to understand Chinese defamation law in terms of the authoritative suppression of press freedom. Though for specific cases the proportion of power is still determinant. The government and government officials do not need defamation litigation to suppress speech. And in the commercial environment, the media is susceptible to influence from the powerful. Thus, to some extent, the medias willingness to succumb to the politics and business is more threatening to freedom of expression and free press than defamation litigation. Furthermore, the willingness of ordinary people to sue officially affiliated media and the court willingness to handle such cases suggest the legal consciousness of ordinary Chinese people and the increasing independence of Chinese court."

But scant research has focused on the relationship between Nixons well-documented intimidation and manipulation campaigns and the critical intra-media discursive response. Focusing on the presidential coverage and intra-media discourse during 1972 and using the historical method of textual analysis, this study suggests that the resulting critical media response manifested itself in two ways: that it triggered a general reaffirmation for and renewed articulation of the journalistic adversarial mission; and that it also prompted serious discussion about the need for self-policing mechanisms within the news media."

The present study argues that the reason for inconclusive findings may lie in how we conceptualize and operationally define fear appeals-based anti-smoking PSAs. In order to provide an accurate method to define fear appeals, we attempt to identify threat components (i.e., fear antecedents: loss of control, health, social) and test which threat components are perceived as highly susceptible and severe when targeting college students. Second, we introduce and test Izards (1977) differential emotions scale (DES) as a tool to systematically measure multiple affective outcomes from fear appeals message processing. The key findings were that loss of control proposed in this study was perceived as more susceptible and severe than social threat when targeting college students. We also found that DES has a great potential to systematically measure multiple affective outcomes from fear message processing."
2006-0374,Deindividuation Effects on Group Polarization in Computer-Mediated Communication,Group Processes in CMC,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Deindividuation Effects on Group Polarization in Computer-Mediated Communication,Group Processes in CMC,"The present experiment investigated how deindividuation affects group polarization in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Before exchanging their opinions about social dilemmas with three ostensible partners via computer, participants either shared some personal information (individuated) or not (deindividuated). Consistent with the Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE), deindividuation fostered group identification with the partners, which in turn induced greater opinion polarization, partly by heightening concerns about public evaluations. Although participants rated the partners arguments more positively when they identified with the partners, perceived argument quality did not significantly affect post-discussion opinion shift. Deindividuation did not reduce private self-awareness nor did private self-awareness significantly influence attitude polarization. Implications are discussed in light of SIDE and the referent informational influence theory."

However, the diverse understanding of deliberation impedes the empiricalization of research on deliberative democracy. In this paper, I first distinguished deliberative theories from either liberalism or republicanism and then chose a minimal approach to deliberation, in other words, accommodating the deliberative principles while requiring as few as possible from general citizens. Based on this carefully selected approach, I scrutinized available measures of the prerequisites, the procedures, and the outcomes of deliberation on both individual and collective levels. With the knowledge that we already have a set of good measures such as willingness to argue, freedom to talk, political knowledge, and argument repertoire, I proposed that several important areas need to be explored: Mutual respect in the deliberative procedure, individual affect outcomes, and collective decision-making outcomes. A preliminary data analysis of mutual respect in the deliberative procedure helps us to think how to do the exploratory work in those attempting areas."

Though there is a large literature addressing bullying, many studies have found inconsistent results on demographic differences in bullying and its association with other problem behaviors. This paper focuses on four dimensions of bullying behaviors  direct and indirect aggression and victimization  and examines demographic variation in their prevalence, co-occurrence, and association with other health outcomes. Analyses of a large, diverse data set (n = 79,492) of sixth through twelfth graders in a large metropolitan area in the United States identified several key findings. After peaking in 7-8th grade, there is a general decline in bullying behavior, with males reporting higher levels of most types of bullying behaviors. White and Asian students were less likely to report bullying behavior, while African-American and Native American students were more likely to do so. Most youth involved with bullying were either perpetrators or victims, but generally not both. Substance use was more strongly associated with aggression, and depressive affect was somewhat more strongly associated with victimization. Overall, the findings support the importance of distinguishing different dimensions of bullying behaviors and considering how they vary by demographic characteristics. This study has significant implications for health communication scholars interested in designing, implementing, and evaluating programs targeting this important issue and concludes with a discussion of implications for prevention."

perceived in the eyes of Israeli adolescents from three ethnic groups: Jews, Moslem-Arabs and
Christian-Arabs. The sources are interpersonal (parents, siblings, peers), professional (school,
health professionals) and the mass media (television, radio, internet, films, books and
newspapers and magazines). Regardless of ethnicity, all of the sources are perceived as
moderately useful at best. Peers, television, internet and newspapers and magazines are
perceived as the most useful. Compared to Jews, Arabs perceive nearly all of the sources as more
useful, but there are no major differences between Moslems and Christians. In comparison with
males, females perceive their parents as more useful and the electronic media as less useful, but
there are no signs of a consistent gender-ethnicity interaction. Overall, the results partly replicate
the findings of American studies, but they are not strongly supportive of media system
dependency theory, since high usefulness of media sources does not correlate with lack of
usefulness of interpersonal and professional sources."

To explore consumers information search process in online purchase, the hypothesized model was tested among product categories (digital cameras, laptop computers, and plasma TVs). The hypothesized model was based on Bettmans framework for determinants of external search, and modified for the study context, including accessibility of favored product brands. As the interest group of the study was online users who had the experience of online purchases, an online consumer panel was used for a study sample. For data analysis, a two-step process was used, beginning with a confirmatory factor analysis procedure, followed by the structural equation modeling tests. The causal relationships among study variables were inconsistent across sample sub-groups and further investigation on consumers information search process is provided with sample sub-groups comparison."

This paper tests the comprehensive model of information seeking which predicts the breadth of channels and scope of sources of information seeking with a sample of youth from this region. The results indicate the data were not consistent with the model but were consistent with a revised model. Implications for information seeking theory and practice are discussed.
2006-0380,Diasporic Dilemma: Raising Children Amidst Two Cultures,Family Communication,Interpersonal Communication,,,Extended Abstract,Diasporic Dilemma: Raising Children Amidst Two Cultures,Family Communication,"While crossing national borders becomes easier and more commonplace in the new global order, navigating cultural boundaries remains dilemmatic. This study explores one such diasporic dilemma among people from India in the United States, the dilemma of how to raise children in American society. The blurring of cultural boundaries is countered by the felt need to preserve traditional ways of life for diasporic Indians. Using a model of value-types developed by Schwartz (1992), this study classified Indian values and U.S. values to understand contradictions posed by conflicting cultural values. Twenty Indian women with children were interviewed. While these women perceived contradictions between their own traditional expectations and those of U.S. culture, they also acknowledged that their children were American. The tension between transmitting traditional values to the next generation while accommodating the exigencies of daily living was negotiated by various coping mechanisms of which open communication with children was seen as an important one. The results of this study highlighted cultural differences as a major component of the complexity of interpersonal relationships in diasporic family life."

The findings show that consumers are aware of the causes and the effects of the Digital Divide. At the same time, the same findings show the consumers are not necessarily eager to narrow the Digital Divide gap if they do not see the reason for going digital. This notion of the un-willingness to progress should be considered as an important criterion in the region of Central-Eastern Europe that is considered as economically moderately developed."
2006-0401,"Dimensions of Social Capital: Civic Engagement, Social Trust, and Media Use",Media Use: The Latest Research,Mass Communication,,,Paper,"Dimensions of Social Capital: Civic Engagement, Social Trust, and Media Use",Media Use: The Latest Research,"This research explores the specific relationship between social capital variables and media use based on a new typology. In the typology, civic engagement and social trust have been divided into two dimensions: substance (political-non-political) and level (macro-micro), based on 2000 NES data. An analysis suggests that overall media use has an influence on engagement but shows no effect whatsoever on trust. News attention operates as the strongest predictor of civic engagement, especially in the micro- political area. The noteworthy point is that non-political trust affects both political engagement and political trust. This study also supported the virtuous circle between civic engagement and social trust in the previous studies as well as the stronger relationship between the same categories in engagement and trust."

Through participant observation and analyzing the discourse of fans in the visual community  Super Voice Girls board of a popular web site, this study explores how fans interconnect Super Voice Girl and their daily lives as well as under such interconnection how this media event mirrors diverse social cultural issues in contemporary Chinese society. The paper concludes that fans are empowered in the televise world offered by the show and that they decode this most inviting vision ever of participation, expression and decision which is not common in the real life via rich and meaningful ways. Through these decoding, critical social issues in Contemporary China like civic democracy, elite vs. mass culture and feminism are reflected."

It examines three ways overseas Chinese are talked about in China, demonstrating that identities are fluid and discursive constructions, a symbolic product of multiple forces such as political and cultural ideologies, social interactions, and interpersonal relationships. This study also shows that social interactions and personal relationships can help transform political and cultural ideologies."

Specifically, this study examines the influence of disembodiment along with demographics and online chat use on social support, loneliness, and depression. The results suggest that disembodiment in online interaction is a compelling contributor to increased loneliness and depression and decreased social support. However, the amount of online chat use is a positive indicator of several variables of social psychological well-being. These paradoxical results show that online interaction is a social technology used for offline connection, but interactants preference for disembodiment is associated with declines in social support and psychosocial well-being. As consistent with the findings of previous studies about online interaction particularly among young interactants, interaction motives such as preference and disembodiment affect negative outcomes, whereas amount of time does not predict the same outcomes. Experience with online interaction, various motives for online social interaction including disembodiment, or advances in communication technologies may help to explain the discrepancy across studies of online social interaction."

One major feature of Chinese media is that they have to satisfy the contending needs of the state and the market. The bargaining metaphor is utilized to describe how media utility decreases and how state utility increases simultaneously when slanting moves from 0 to 1. A model is then set up to show how the power distance and location distance between media and government determines media slanting. Two cases confirm the proposition generated by the model. Luoxi Bridge Event shows that when the distance between media and government concerned is positive, the slanting degree decreases, whereas when the power distance is zero or negative, the slanting degree enhances. Niuniu Event indicates that when the location distance between media and government concerned is positive, the slanting degree reduces, whereas when the location distance is zero, the slanting degree increases."

Additionally, a framework for how ICCSs may either complement or compensate for the doctor-patient relationship is proposed. Regression analysis indicated that the only statistically significant predictor of service use was that patients with a more negative appraisal about their doctor relationship used the Ask an Expert service more frequently. In addition, there were trends toward a more negative appraisal of the doctor-patient relationship being associated with higher use of information and interactive services. Conversely, there was a trend toward a more positive appraisal predicting higher use of the Discussion Group service. In terms of statistically significant effects, more frequent utilization of information services was associated with a more positive appraisal of the doctor relationship. Given the importance of the doctor-patient relationship in influencing how cancer patients appraise their satisfaction with medical care, recommendations are made for future research directions."

In Latin America, economic reformers placed high priority on the telecom sector, and telco privatizations, liberalizations, and deregulation. The results of reforms in Mexico have included both dramatic growth in access to wireless telephony and a lingering telecommunications divide. Research suggests that the rapid diffusion of wireless telephony, together with the data services built into second generation cell phones, provide an opportunity for Mexico to promote universal service goals for the Internet using the Wireless Web. High pricing and a lack of competition in the wireless telephony market, together with the universal service commitments of the eMexico initiative, justify a subsidy to provide cell phone users with free or inexpensive access to the wireless Web and a wireless eMexico portal."

A Test of the Anger Activism Model,Cognitive/Emotional Processes in Persuasion,Information Systems,,,Paper,Does Anger Facilitate or Debilitate Persuasion? A Test of the Anger Activism Model,Cognitive/Emotional Processes in Persuasion,"The ability of anger to facilitate or debilitate persuasion in pro-attitudinal vs. counter-attitudinal messages was investigated using the Anger Activism Model (AAM). Undergraduate students (N=175) were recruited for 2 x 2 independent groups experimental design to examine the effect of anger appeals and efficacy on attitudes and behavioral intentions. Pro-attitudinal audiences can be subdivided into four groups based on feelings of anger and perceptions of efficacy: activist, empowered, angry, and disinterested. Results indicated that groups descended in order from most to least persuasive outcomes. Pro-attitudinal individuals high in anger and efficacy had positive attitudes, perceived message persuasiveness, and were most willing to engage in difficult behaviors. For counter-attitudinal individuals, anger debilitated persuasion. The findings illustrate that not only is the level of anger important, but that the level of efficacy is critical."
2006-0409,Does Campaign Coverage Improve as Election Day Approaches?,Election Coverage around the World,Political Communication,,,Paper,Does Campaign Coverage Improve as Election Day Approaches?,Election Coverage around the World,"From democratic theory perspective, the media has an informative function. The media should facilitate the electoral process and convey information that is relevant for decision-making among citizens. But media should also according to democratic theory, in addition to this basic informational function, engage and mobilize the public. Taking these two dimensions into consideration, this study presents a framework for evaluating the quality of election campaign reporting.

But it also contains an empirical study how these demands are fulfilled in television news during three parliamentary election campaigns in Sweden. The question to be answered is if the election reporting gets better or worse approaching Election Day. The study is based on a content analysis of broadcast news in Swedish national television the last four weeks of the national election campaign 1982, 1991 and 2002. A total of 1,082 stories/bulletins are included in the analysis.
The results show a tendency towards more dramatized election coverage as Election Day approaches. This tendency is clearer 2002 compared to election coverage of the 1982 and 1991 campaigns. Interpretation and implications of these findings are discussed."

The study was conducted during the 2004 election. We find that when electronic agents elicit individual preferences and provide information about the alternatives, voters do, indeed, alter their evaluations to be consistent with their own issue stands. They not only increased support for the best-fitting candidate, but also decreased support for their preferred candidate. There are two important aspects of these results. First, it appears to be real change, holding for two weeks, at least until the night before the election. Second, the effect was stronger when the information was about a candidates supporters stands than the candidates stands on the issues."
2006-0411,Does Involvement Moderate the Effectiveness of Gain Versus Loss Framed Messages Alone?,Message Strategies: Involvement,Health Communication,,,Paper,Does Involvement Moderate the Effectiveness of Gain Versus Loss Framed Messages Alone?,Message Strategies: Involvement,"This study aims to resolve the seemingly conflicting or mixed findings in past research regarding how involvement moderates message framing effects (gain vs. loss). This study argues that the effects of message framing would be varied depending on whether research adopts person-oriented enduring involvement or situation-oriented (situational) involvement as a moderating variable. These varying effects are based upon the different role of enduring and situational involvement in information processing. Situational involvement plays a role of motivation and ability together in information processing while enduring involvement plays only a role of motivation. For comparing the moderating role of two different types of involvement for message framing effects, two experiments were conducted. The findings appeared to be consistent with our grand expectation that enduring involvement and situational involvement differently moderate message framing effects. Yet the detailed findings revealed to be a little bit mixed or complicated. This study discussed intensively in these regards."

The Burden of Cancer in News Coverage of 1988-1992,"Cancer and Tobacco News Coverage: Implications for Screening, Prevention, and Advocacy","This study examines how news stories depict different burdens of cancer by incorporating public health literature to communication and journalism. A systematic content analysis of news coverage from the crucial period 1988 to 1992, when the cancer incidence and mortality rates began to decrease significantly, indicates that more than half of the coverage highlighted the individual burden of cancer rather than the social or epidemiological burden, regardless of changes in epidemiological trends. Rather, the types of burdens appear significantly associated with the news values or theme frames. Individual burdens are represented through personal experiences, especially narratives detailing cause or treatment, while the social burdens are associated generally with the news themes relating to cancer policy. Also, the individual burdens typically relate to soft news values, while the social burdens most often reflected hard news values. The news frames of cancer burdens may be associated more with journalistic routines and readers news values than with factual representations of epidemiological phenomena and scientific information. It may be here that debatable questions concerning the news frames of health-related messages are identified."

Respondents (N = 124) participated in a web-based survey, where participants responded to one of four surveys focusing on face-to-face, telephone, e-mail, or instant messaging interactions. In general, this test of channel expansion theory has provided somewhat mixed results. While in general, support was found for some of the tenets of the theory, such as the experience of the communication partners, there appears to be more going on in other areas than the theory can account for. The results highlight key differences in perceptions of new and traditional communication media."

The study surveyed 195 college students and a structural model was built to explain effects of the Internet on school life satisfaction using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In line with social cognitive theory and literature on social effects of the Internet, current data supported the hypotheses that Internet use, online social support and online self-efficacy had direct positive impacts on life satisfaction. Offline extraversion, online extraversion, social self-efficacy and outcome expectations influenced life satisfaction indirectly: offline extraversion acted through social self-efficacy and online extraversion; social self-efficacy acted through online extraversion, outcome expectations and social support; online extraversion acted through outcome expectations; outcome expectations acted through online social support and Internet use. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, the path from outcome expectations to life satisfaction was negative. These findings had implications for Internet social effects research and social cognitive theory."

An Analysis of the Mediating Role Communication Between Intention and Condom Use Behavior Among Women,"HIV/AIDS Communication: Condom Use, Condom Negotiation, and Voluntary Testing","The theory of reasoned action posits that condom use cannot be a targeted behavior for women, since they cannot simply wear a male condom. Others note that condom use is negotiated with a partner, unlike other targeted behavior like alcohol consumption or quitting smoking. This study examines if condom use communication, including initiating a conversation and trying to persuade a partner to use a condom, mediates the relationship between condom use and the remainder of the theory of reasoned action. Using a sample of 144 women at moderate risk for HIV/AIDS, this study finds that condom use communication mediates the relationship between intention to use condoms and the percentage of time a condom is used with a main partner. About one quarter of women reported that their partner resisted using a condom. Additionally, the most common resisting behavior for partners are stating they are disappointed and telling a partner not to worry. Future research should examine condom use negotiation between women and their main partners."

This study investigated the interrelationships among these domains using television violence as a stimulus and measures from all four domains as outcome variables. Media violence exposure produced emotional and physiological desensitization in men, but not in women. Additional results indicated that physiological response to violent media was the strongest predictor of intervention behavior, that emotional response to violent media was the strongest predictor of proviolence attitudes, and that the influences of physiology and emotion were largely independent of the other domains. A model of the causal sequence of desensitization suggested by the results of this study is provided."

So far research has highlighted factors that explain commonalities in debates between countries as a result of European competences and events. This paper makes an attempt to understand why a specific European issue is debated in a country, but disregarded in another or why issues are debated differently in different countries. Three hypotheses are developed that specify how the national level colors the domestic adaptations of a common European input. To find evidence for the impact of national levels on European debates, a network analysis is conducted for the German and French media reporting and commentating on EU enlargement and a common European Constitution. This network analytic concept of public debates allows for an actor-based and relational explanation of agenda-building processes."

After formulating a framework for praxis-based theories of technology, I select four internet-based groups as institutional exemplars for analysis: Democratic Underground, Free Republic, Indymedia, and Move On. These groups implement distinct types of democratic applications of internet technology and embody specific strands of democratic theory. I conclude by commenting on the direction of internet-based democratic practices, their political efficacy in terms of strategy and tactics, and how they figure within U.S. political culture."

If successful, stations may be able to play twice as many individual ad units while keeping the overall duration of commercial breaks constant. This within-subjects experiment tests the effects of such a circumstance on variables including heart rate, skin conductance level, attitudes and memory. Results suggest that breaks with more ad units lead to cognitive disengagement, increased duration estimates, and more negative attitudes compared to ad breaks with fewer units."

The hearings were called to solicit public input on a proposed zoning change. This zoning proposal would allow for the construction of a Wal-Mart Super Center on an environmentally sensitive site. While Wal-Mart has become a lightening rod for many issues, what is unique to this case is that the Super Wal-Mart would be built over the towns source of drinking water. Storm-water runoff from large parking lots such as those found with big box stores is one of the major sources of water contamination in the USA. So the proposed Wal-Mart location and the corresponding threat to the aquifer are the main issues which galvanized many local residents to speak out at these public hearings. Many of the participants spoke about the risk involved in going forward with the proposal. Given that the risk here can be seen as a technical matter, we examine how ordinary citizens talk about risk. Some participants draw on the words of others during their presentation. Our focus is on the various communication practices in using anothers words in talking risk: in the use of quotes from written documents and in reporting anothers speech. These practices make the presentations more interactive and dialogical by introducing multiple voices in ones presentation. These multiple voices in the form of quotes allows the speaker to affirm or challenge these in the course of their presentation to the board."
2006-0422,Dr. Phil Meets the Candidates: How Family Life and Personal Experience Produce Political Discussion,Mediated and Interpersonal Talk about Politics,Political Communication,,,Paper,Dr. Phil Meets the Candidates: How Family Life and Personal Experience Produce Political Discussion,Mediated and Interpersonal Talk about Politics,"In the fall of 2004, George Bush and John Kerry appeared with their wives in two separate episodes of the Dr. Phil Show. They talked about their families, how they raised their children, and how they combined family life with their political careers. Campaign and political issues were purposively kept out of the conversations. In this paper, audience responses to these two shows, posted on the Dr. Phil website, have been analysed. They enable an empirical examination of two key issues in contemporary political communication: the impact of infotainment, soft news and personalisation on the way people make sense of politics, and the question whether and how internet forums function to revitalize political debate and deliberation. Our analysis shows first that the political relevance of the private and family lives of the candidates was heavily contested among the people discussing on the Dr. Phil site. However, the family life and values of the discussants themselves served as a legitimate point of departure for their political positions. Secondly, our analysis demonstrates that the Dr. Phil forum functioned as a place of political affirmation instead of deliberation. The forum constitutes a public space in which people can show to others what their political identity is and what their opinions are, without subjecting them to discussion and exchange. It is in particular the private, family position and experience from which the participants speak, that produce a performance of politics, rather than a deliberation of it."

2006-0424,East Meets West: Towards a Philosophical Linkage Between Symmetrical Worldview and Um-Yang Paradigm for Ethical Public Relations,Public Relations High Density Session: Young Talent,Public Relations,,,Paper,East Meets West: Towards a Philosophical Linkage Between Symmetrical Worldview and Um-Yang Paradigm for Ethical Public Relations,Public Relations High Density Session: Young Talent,"This conceptual essay looks for a philosophical linkage between symmetrical worldview and um-yang paradigm. The symmetrical worldview provides a foundation in development of a normative model of public relations (e.g., two-way symmetrical approach). We found the symmetrical worldview shares some crucial common cores assumed in the um-yang paradigm that is embedded in many social values and morality in the Asian societies. Whereas many societies demand public relations expertise worldwide, practitioners worldwide also demand a metaphysical framework to judge what is ethical or morally acceptable in their practices. Our essay speculates on how societies that subscribe to different cultural heritages would reconcile in bringing others experience and knowledge into their practices. We show one way to make a metaphysical linkage between two different philosophical frameworks. Such a metaphysical linkage helps public relations practitioners in two different cultures recognize what they believed would be an illusory difference (cf. moral relativism). We search for a feasible reconciliation among public relations, ethical frameworks, and cultures."
2006-0425,Economic Determination of the Box Office Performances of Foreign Motion Pictures in the Singapore Cinema Market,Global Movie Flows,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Economic Determination of the Box Office Performances of Foreign Motion Pictures in the Singapore Cinema Market,Global Movie Flows,"This article studies the determination of the box office performance of international movies in Singapore. Based on the international media trade economics literature, economic and content factors are identified and operationalized to explain empirically the market popularities of foreign movies, which comprise virtually the entire theatrical releases in Singapore. Films with regard to countries of production origin are also compared in sale performance. The results of our regressions, executed over the population of 2002-2004 films, demonstrate that a films revenue performance in its domestic market is by far the most significant determinant for the box office success in Singapore. Certain genres as movies content attributes are shown to have attracted more admissions than others, while the scale of production investment also makes a significant positive contribution to sales. Further, the findings reveal that the Singapore cinema market imports more pictures from countries with larger economic scales. The larger population and higher per-capita GDP an exporting country has, among all film exporters, it sells more movies to Singapore and its movies garner a greater aggregate sales performance. Last, it is also indicated that the Singaporean audience tends to accept films better that are from origins with linguistic or cultural proximity."
2006-0426,Effect of Message Framing on Promotion/Prevention-Focused Chinese Consumers Purchase Decision,Trust and Message Framing in E-Commerce,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Effect of Message Framing on Promotion/Prevention-Focused Chinese Consumers Purchase Decision,Trust and Message Framing in E-Commerce,"The examination of self-regulation has received less attention among scholars in the area of mass communication as compared to the consumer behavior field. The purpose of the current research is to link four concepts: self regulatory focus theory, utilitarian/hedonic product attribute, message framing and advertising effect to examine the relationship between individuals characteristics and their purchase decisions.
The results show two main consistent patterns. First, promotion-focused individuals have a greater tendency to select a product with hedonic attributes than do prevention-focused individuals. Second, when the advertisement is presented in a gain frame, it is more persuasive for promotion-focused individuals. The results also statistically indicate that across all individuals a gain frame is more persuasive for individuals who prefer a product with hedonic attributes, whereas a loss frame is more persuasive for individuals who prefer a product with utilitarian attributes."
2006-0427,Effects of Emotional Television Program Context on Advertising Processing,Mediated Messages and Information Processing in Individuals and Groups,Information Systems,,,Paper,Effects of Emotional Television Program Context on Advertising Processing,Mediated Messages and Information Processing in Individuals and Groups,"This study aims to offer a better understanding of program context effects on advertising processing by addressing theoretical and measurement weaknesses in previous research. In this study, viewers physiological arousal is assessed using skin conductance responses, valence of emotion responses is measured using facial EMG (zygomatic and corregator activity), and cognitive effort is indicated by heart rate. Encoding of information is assessed using recognition and storage of information is measured using free recall. Attitudes towards advertisements as a function of program context are also assessed. Physiological arousal, cognitive effort, and recognition were found to decay cross the advertisement blocks. The results provide evidence for the proposed underlying motivational activation mechanisms and processing of emotional program context effects, and demonstrate the importance and utility of considering both the valence and arousal dimensions of emotion simultaneously and of studying their interactions. They also display how the effects examined unfold over time."
2006-0428,Effects of Humor on Presence and Recall of Persuasive Messages,Cognitive/Emotional Processes in Persuasion,Information Systems,,,Paper,Effects of Humor on Presence and Recall of Persuasive Messages,Cognitive/Emotional Processes in Persuasion,"This investigation examined how exposure to a humorous persuasive message affects antecedents of presence, the perceptual illusion of nonmediation, and how this sense of presence facilitates message recall. Fifty-eight participants in an experimental study viewed either a humorous or non-humorous version of an alcohol PSA and then completed measures of positive mood, perceived credibility, psychological reactance, presence, and message recall. As predicted by a model, positive mood related positively to perceived credibility and negatively to reactance. Increased perceived credibility was associated with greater feelings of presence, which negatively affected recognition memory. These findings suggest that, in some cases, presence may impede persuasive message recall, though not necessarily to the detriment of attitude change."
2006-0429,Effects of Interactivity on Attitude Formation on Political Websites: A Path Analysis of the Mediation Effect of Perceived Interactivity,Theories of Communication Technology Use,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Effects of Interactivity on Attitude Formation on Political Websites: A Path Analysis of the Mediation Effect of Perceived Interactivity,Theories of Communication Technology Use,"Given the lack of conceptual consistency in the field of interactivity research, this study redefines the concept of interactivity by relocating the locus of interactivity further into users perception. And then, based on the idea that objective (or technological) aspects of interactivity may not exactly correspond to the perceptual (or subject) aspects of interactivity and thus perceived interactivity may mediate the effects of objective aspects of interactivity on certain outcomes, this study hypothesizes a mediation model of website interactivity. The results from the experimental data gathered from 78 college students show that perceived interactivity fully mediated the effect of objective interactivity on attitude toward the content of the political website and partially mediated attitude toward the website itself and attitude toward the politician for whom the website was designed. However, for attitude toward policy issues suggested by the politician on his website, mediation model could not be established. The results of path analyses proved the validity of the mediation model of website interactivity as a whole. In the relationship between objective interactivity and perceived interactivity, internet self-efficacy was found to be an important moderator. Theoretical and practical implications of these results were discussed for future research."
2006-0430,Effects of Issue News Framing on Public Support for Turkish Membership in the EU,Mass Media and the European Union,Political Communication,,,Paper,Effects of Issue News Framing on Public Support for Turkish Membership in the EU,Mass Media and the European Union,"This article reports the results of three studies designed to investigate the presence and possible effects of issue specific news frames. The study focuses on the topic of potential membership of Turkey in the European Union. The frames conceptualized in this study are theoretically driven, are clearly delineated from other news frames, and are found in actual news media content providing external validity to the study of the effects of these frames. The news media framing of the issue was assessed through a content analysis of national newspapers and television news. Several frames in the political, economic and cultural realm were identified. These frames all carried an inherent valence that framed the issue in either positive or negative terms. A first experimental study showed significant differences in the level of support between respondents who had received a positive news frame and respondents who had received a negative news frame. The results of a second experimental study corroborated the first study, but demonstrated that negative news frames yield stronger effects than positive news frames and that exposure to news frames can affect public policy support even in a multivariate test controlling for other influences."
2006-0431,Effects of Model Race/Ethnicity on Responses to Print Advertising: Do Popular Culture and Prejudice Make a Difference?,Advances in Advertising Research I,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Effects of Model Race/Ethnicity on Responses to Print Advertising: Do Popular Culture and Prejudice Make a Difference?,Advances in Advertising Research I,"The purpose of this research was to explore white non-Hispanic viewers processing of black and Hispanic race/ethnicity in advertising. Previous research has offered mixed results in white subjects evaluations of ads with black models, while little research has been done with white subjects evaluations of ads with Hispanic models. An experiment with a repeated measure design was used to investigate the impact of model race/ethnicity on white attitudes and purchase intentions. Participants saw three print advertisements with Hispanic, black, and white models. Prejudice and a new variable, popular culture identification (PCI), were used as covariates in the experiment. Popular culture identification was defined as the identification with popular culture as represented in the following current media products: television programs, movies, rap or hip-hop music, and mainstream magazines. The sample included 76 white non-Hispanic students attending a Midwestern university. Two theoretical perspectives, Tajfels social identification theory (1978) and Kelmans (1958) social influence theory, were used in the study. Hypotheses predicted that white participants would favor ads with white models after prejudice and PCI were controlled. Findings indicated that model race/ethnicity was not a salient characteristic for whites. Prejudice was a possible cause for some backlash against non-white models by high prejudiced whites. In addition, PCI was found to have a relationship with consumers attitudes. The potential for PCI as an explanatory variable in consumer research was discussed."
2006-0432,Effects of Motivational Activation on Processing Positive and Negative Content in Pop-Up Advertisements,"Rethinking Concepts, Methods, and Modeling in Information Processing Research",Information Systems,,,Paper,Effects of Motivational Activation on Processing Positive and Negative Content in Pop-Up Advertisements,"Rethinking Concepts, Methods, and Modeling in Information Processing Research","This study investigated the impact of motivational types on viewing time, memory strength (sensitivity), and decision making (criterion bias) in response to pop-up advertisements with positive and negative content. The motivational types were measured using the Motivational Activation Measurement developed by A. Lang and her colleagues. The MAM indexes the degree of an individuals tendency to approach pleasant stimuli or to avoid unpleasant situations.
Individuals high in positivity offset viewed positive pop-up ads longer than individuals low in positivity offset, demonstrating more exploratory and approaching responses to positive stimuli. Individuals high in negativity bias spent longer time watching negative pop-up ads, which demonstrates allocation of more attentional resources to the ads, compared to those low in negativity bias. In accordance with the previous findings, positivity offset was found to be not a predictor for encoding. To the contrary, individuals high in negativity bias remembered the ads better than those low in negativity bias; these people have a tendency of remember novel events or objects better, since they could force their environment to change.
The criterion bias data revealed participants high in positivity offset had more conservative decision criterion, compared to participants low in positivity offset. Individuals high in negativity bias also showed more conservative decision criterion compared to individuals low in negativity bias. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Using structural equation modeling, the linkages of mutual relationship constructs and the sources of attitude formation constructs were analyzed. The results showed that mutual relationship constructs, with the exception of dependability, were predictors of the sources of attitude formation constructs. In addition, the effect of audience trust is direct and stronger in forming audience attitude, in comparison to the indirect effect of audience satisfaction."
2006-0451,Effects of Personality Types on Television Genre Preferences,Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Effects of Personality Types on Television Genre Preferences,Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,"This study has explored the effects of Eysencks PEN personality types on viewers television program genre preferences for news, soap operas, reality shows, talk shows, and crime dramas. The underlying assumption of the study was that ones television genre preference would be affected by his/her stable and enduring personality types. Specific predictions on personality types and their associations with television genre preference were provided. Findings show that: 1) Neuroticism was the most influential personality type for preference of television genres; 2) Extraversion was associated with reality show genre preference, such that high extraverts more preferred the genre than low extraverts; and 3) Psychoticism was negatively associated with news genre preference and reality programming, such that low psychotics more preferred watching the two genres than high psychotics. Implications of personalities and TV genre preference were discussed."
2006-0452,"Effects of Political Knowledge, Interest, and Efficacy on College Voter Turnout",Youth Engagement in the Political Process,Political Communication,,,Paper,"Effects of Political Knowledge, Interest, and Efficacy on College Voter Turnout",Youth Engagement in the Political Process,"The focus of this study is 165 college-aged voters in the 2004 presidential election. We measured political knowledge, interest, and efficacy before randomly assigning participants to one of four videos designed to elevate knowledge, interest, and efficacy compared to a control. Participant turn out in the election was remarkably high (77%), and this precluded analysis of factors impacting turn out. Participants who watched a video containing the Bush-Kerry debates experienced elevated political knowledge. Further, there was evidence that increases in political knowledge produced by watching the political debate lead to decreased favoribilty ratings for Bush. Higher ratings of trust were correlated with positive favorability ratings for Bush. We discuss civic participation, the factors behind the drop in voter turnout, and relate these debates to the approaches that have been undertaken to increase voter turnout. Finally, we discuss methodological problems particular to studying youth voter turnout."
2006-0453,Effects of Self-Construal and Academic Motivation on Students' Perception of Professors Self-Presentation Styles,tructional and Developmental Communication Interactive Paper Session,Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,Effects of Self-Construal and Academic Motivation on Students' Perception of Professors Self-Presentation Styles,Instructional and Developmental Communication Interactive Paper Session,"The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of different self-presentation styles adopted by professors at the begging of the semester. One of the basic assumptions of the present study is that ones own concept and view of the self would strongly influence the way in which people evaluate others self-presentations. Previous studies have shown that self-construals significantly influence receivers perception toward various self presentation styles. So far, however, most studies on self-presentation styles have paid little attention to specific social contexts such as instruction. Despite the importance of the beginning of classes, few studies have investigated the effects of self-presentation styles in the contexts of instructions, while a significant number of studies have focused on the impact of self-presentation styles on romantic relationships, strangers, friend relations, and other general interpersonal communication situations. This study proposes that, besides self-construals, instruction-specific factors such as academic motivation would also influence the perception process. An experiment was conducted with the sample of 384 undergraduate students at a large private university in a metropolitan area. The results showed that the students evaluated positive self presentations most favorably, followed by bragging, and then by negative self-presentation. On the other hand, as for perceived competence, there was no significant difference between professors bragging and positive presentations. A series of regression analyses revealed that, besides self-construals, students academic motivations significantly explained students perception on professors self-presentation styles in terms of likeability and perceived competence. Practical implications for teachers were discussed."
2006-0454,Effects of Social Integration on Adjustment to a New Location After a Long Distance Move,Electronic and Social Integration,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Effects of Social Integration on Adjustment to a New Location After a Long Distance Move,Electronic and Social Integration,"A residential move is a common occurrence in the US, where approximately 14% of the population moves annually. While prior research has focused on who moves and why people move, relatively little is known about factors that influence how well people adjust after the move. Using longitudinal data from a US sample of over 600 individuals who moved long distance in the previous 4-8 months, I examine the impact of social integration in the prior location, attachment to prior community as well as pre-existing personal ties in the new location on emotional and functional adjustment to the new location and perceived social support. my results indicate that informal social involvement in the prior location has an enduring negative effect on emotional adjustment to the new location but predicts more perceived social support in the new location. Knowing friends in the new location prior to the move, however, is beneficial for both emotional and functional adjustment to the new location as well as perceived social support. my data suggest that these effects get weaker over time."
2006-0455,Ego and Public Sphere: A Buddhist Asiacentric Approach,Global Public Discourse,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Ego and Public Sphere: A Buddhist Asiacentric Approach,Global Public Discourse,"This paper argues that ego or sense of being can disrupt the ideals of public sphere. The idea of ego in Habermass theory of public sphere is reviewed to point out the ambiguity of its definition and usage in his works. The paper then reviews Levinass works as it has been applied to public sphere by other scholars and finds the issue of ego has been skirted by Levinas. Centering ego in its discussion, an alternative model for public sphere is proposed. Using a Buddhist Asiacentric approach, this paper offers four new theoretical components to enable/bolster the public sphere theory. These new components are: 1) Public sphere as the dynamic between harmony and ego (as distinct from Habermass morality and praxis), (2) the importance of silence in the public sphere (3) the influence of the environment on dialogue in the public sphere (4) the significance of intrapersonal communicative practices like meditation in the public sphere."

A Longitudinal Study of the Mobilizing Effects of Elections,Determining the Vote and Voter Turnout,"In the theory and practice of democratic politics, elections are essential. Not only is voting the one activity that binds the individual to the political system; elections are also expected to mobilize people politically. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to study the mobilizing effects of national elections, using Sweden as a case study. More specifically, this paper investigates political interest, party identification, trust in political and media institutions, media consumption and satisfaction through the electoral cycles between 1986 and 2004. The results show that elections do mobilize people politically, but not with regards to the media variables."

Further, and more importantly, by sharing their similarities, members in the collectives function by influencing one another and are being influenced in the process of accomplishing social, economical, organizational and other specific goals. This essay examines the role of computer-mediated communication technologies especially the Internet in creating electronic tribes (i.e., e-tribes). The paper distinguishes between e-tribes and more general online communities, offers theoretical perspectives that inform the communication practices of e-tribe members, and addresses implications from communication, organization, and socio-cultural perspectives. Finally, some recommendations are offered for organizational innovations."

College students constitute a group that has made particularly heavy use of the technology for everything from downloading of music to distance education to instant messaging. We know a lot about the uses made of the Internet by this group of people, but we know less about the relationship between their offline activites and online behavior. This study reports the results of a web survey of a group of university undergraduates exploring the nature of both online and offline in five areas--the use of news and information, the discussion of politics, the seeking of health information, the use of blogs and the downloading of media and software."

The re-positioning of martial affairs at the center of American consciousness served to strengthen the role of the federal government and to buttress a new model of national identity. The manner in which the latter task was achieved through popular culture is the central concern of this paper. From the paroxysm of patriotism inspired by the sinking of the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay to the demonization of new enemies in visual media, cultural producers in the United States found in the experience of conflict overseas a rich vein of popular discourse. Mining from popular attitudes about military prowess and racial hierarchy a steady stream of songs, cartoons, jokes and excited rhetoric, artists, sheet-music purveyors and humorists packaged war  a grim experience most Americans had sworn off after the national catastrophe of a generation before  as a form of amusement. Safely removed from American soil, the fighting in Cuba and the Philippines offered consumers of popular culture an opportunity for vicarious thrills and a way to reconceptualize their place in the world."

Emergence can become a plausible social theory directly applicable to Internet collaborative technologies only in so far as it allows for contradiction, conflict and ambiguity to be not the opposite but intrinsic characteristics of the emergence process. This is illustrated through analysis of the manner in which Wikipedia active members and leaders think about emergence and of the debates that surround Wikipedias central policy, that of the neutral point of view. In both instances, we argue, conflict leads to ambiguization."

The research method consisted of analyzing over 6000 messages posted by 145 women over the course of a six-month intervention. Four basic categories of visualizations were identified: visualizations about treatments; visualizations projected to others, visualizations to comfort or heal and visualizations of a spiritual nature. Future research directions and suggestions for improving psychosocial interventions for women with breast cancer are discussed."
2006-0462,"Emotional Congruency, Media Dependency, and the Realism of Media Stories",Understanding the Role of Emotion in Processing Media,Information Systems,,,Paper,"Emotional Congruency, Media Dependency, and the Realism of Media Stories",Understanding the Role of Emotion in Processing Media,"Based on studies of attribution and story realism it seemed plausible that people might try to mentally fill in information to explain an unexpected emotion expressed by a character in a story. In two earlier experiments unexpected emotions were consistently judged as less real. However, it seems likely that at least in some circumstances people try to make sense of incongruent emotions expressed by a character in a story. The current study explores one of those possible circumstances, when a reader is unfamiliar with a culture. Familiar vs. unfamiliar culture did make a difference. Unexpectedly the difference was for the story version in which no emotion was expressed. The result is interpreted in the context of earlier studies about the effect of typicality on judgments about realism."

Recent research on perceived reality illuminated that an events typicality plays a large role in its perceived reality. Researchers have offered a general account of typicality on perceived reality and memory, but the literature has not addressed how these phenomena occur in emotional context and whether typicality will interact with emotion variables. Research on this aspect is more warranted when considering that most media messages are emotional and emotion has been found to be crucially influential on mediated message processing. This study explores the relationship between typicality and perceived reality in a mediated emotional environment. The experiment is a 4 (Arousal) × 2 (Valence) × 3 (Typicality) × 4 (Repetitions) × 6 (Orders) mixed repeated-measures factorial design."
2006-0464,Emotional Response to News Framing of Crime,Framing Effects,Political Communication,,,Paper,Emotional Response to News Framing of Crime,Framing Effects,"In covering politics, the media provide more than just the facts. They also provide news frames, storytelling devices that allow readers to understand the news. For example, the media can frame the controversy over mandatory minimum sentencing in thematic terms  in other words, the big picture of national trends in crime, the societal forces behind those trends and the consequences of those trends  or in episodic terms  in other words the small picture of an individual facing such a sentence. The choice of which frame to use in illustrating a story about mandatory minimum sentencing could be quite consequential or it could matter very little. In this paper, I take begin to explore the question of how consequential this choice might be.
I present the results from a laboratory experiment examining the effect of episodic and thematic framing on emotional reactions and policy views. Students were randomly assigned to read one of three columns on mandatory minimum sentencing that employed either a thematic or episodic frame. I examine whether the emotions people report after reading the article differs depending upon the frame they receive, whether they give different explanations for their emotional reactions and how these news frames and emotional responses are linked to policy views. My results show that frames influence emotional response. In addition, the results are consistent with the conclusion that news framing effects on public opinion operate through both affective and cognitive channels."

Results showed that, as predicted wives and daughters had greater empathic accuracy than fathers and sons, respectively. Contrary to predictions, however, empathic accuracy and topic coherence were negatively correlated. In addition, results showed interesting gender effects for both individuals as well as for family systems, which showed different patterns of associations between empathic accuracy and coherence for families with sons compared to families with daughters. Most notable among these differences was a tendency for children to adapt their behavior in regard to their own empathic accuracy and topic coherence to be similar to that of their same sex parent, but not to that of their opposite gender parent. Implications of these findings for our understanding of empathic accuracy, topic coherence, and gender on individuals and family systems are discussed."

The study draws on three types of data to examine the related moments of encoding and decoding in local television news: the journalism text, viewer responses posted to the television stations web site, and in-depth interviews of the storys producer and its central source. Respondents drew on four types of interpretive resources to discuss the text: other news stories, shared identity, personal experience, and broad context. I argue that their responses were structured not only by the relatively closed nature of the news genre, but also by the subgenre of sexual assault news."

This study investigates why students do or do not arrange for such conferences. We develop a new instrument, the Out of Class Commmunication Scale, which measures students' perceptions and expectations about this sort of communication episode. The OCCS has four subscales, measuring how helpful, easy, and useful the conferences are likely to be, as well as how desirable and substitutable alternatives (such as phone and email) might be. The subscales predict frequency of visits, with correlations ranging from absolute values of .22 to .39. OCCS scores have some relationships to instructors' perceived assertiveness and responsiveness, as measured by the SCS, as well as correlations to student locus of control. Student sex and age also have some modest connections to OCCS. We regard this investigation as a useful step toward the eventual goal of increasing the frequency and usefulness of out of class communication."

The study sample included 231 recently diagnosed, lower income breast cancer patients. Participants were provided a free computer, Internet access and training in how to use an ICCS called the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) Living with Breast Cancer program. Survey data was collected at pre-test and 4-months after using the system, and use data about how women used the system was also collected.
Use of the information services independently contributed to perceived information competence though use of peer-to-peer services and patient-to-expert services did not.
Consistent with expectations, use of Discussion Group amplified the learning effects of using the information services. However, use of the Ask an Expert service did not amplify the learning effects of using the information services as predicted.
This study suggests that online support groups may supplement and extend the learning potential of information services. Future research questions are suggested to optimize how breast cancer patients use and benefit from having access to an online cancer expert."

A framework derived from the literary tradition is employed to research how viewers reflect upon insights into moral issues, moral deliberation and the Other offered by TV narratives. Forty-one in-depth interviews with people from different gender, age, ethnicity and class were analysed, using a grounded theory approach. Three modes of moral reflection emerged during the analysis (interpretative, additional and associated reflection). Results indicate that people do not only use television narratives to reflect on moral insights, they also seem to enjoy reflecting tremendously and while doing so transcending manifest insights offered by TV narratives. Differences between different groups of people and limitations for moral reflections are discussed. I will argue that television is a broad and interesting resource for the development of moral imagination."

In general the clips produced a TPP and the clips featuring White women were thought to be more influential than clips featuring African American women. An analysis of how question order influenced how fast people answered questions indicates that TPP involves an implicit mental comparison between self and othersmaking it similar to other self-other judgments.

The body of research on the subject has focused on the methods through which members become socialized into an organization, primarily addressing the difference between individual and institutionalized socialization. The current study focused on the experiences of graduate students as they transition into a new department. A qualitative study, the focus was on the individual experiences of the members. Through analysis of interviews, several main threads emerged regarding the experience: initial carryover, information seeking, mentor/peer relationships, and organizational structure. It became apparent that although positive impressions of a department carry over throughout time when consistently reinforced, negative impressions regarding structure and information lead to increased uncertainty regarding expectations."

According to SIR and SIS models, we build the KC dynamic model on simulating the mechanism of KC as complex adaptive systems. From interdisciplinary background, we present several necessary theoretical assumptions and then focus on two main hypotheses: 1) the speed of KC inspires the emergence of complex networks; 2) the structure of KC network influences its efficiency. The paper, in a macro-perspective, simulates the universal model with probability coefficients in different situations, analyzes the results of the curves comparing the small-world network and the random network in order to explain the structural difference, and then discusses the future research combining this simulation and empirical sampling statistics."

While Arendt suggested that identity based on race or whatness is pre-political and unsuitable for the polis, she recommended enlarged thinking and care for the world for healthy politics. Political action, she suggested, was the ultimate indicator of ones identity. The kinds of relationships that she deemed political, were those based on philia, or friendship, rather than those based on eros, or love, passion, or compassion. Identity politics would be maneuvered into the pre-political realms of the social or private according to Arendts distinctions, in part because they are based on categories of whatness and because they frequently employ arguments based on compassion. In addition, they deal with issues that Arendt may have deemed administrative rather than political like water and land rights. Would Arendt actually suggest that such identity politics are based on eros? There are several instances in which Arendt suggested that an identity based on race has been made political through persecution and that the state must be held accountable in the space of appearances for injustices committed. But does she mean retribution? Would such redistributive justice be based on racial identity? This paper describes how we might better understand identity politics, the pre-political, and relationships of eros and philia in Arendts terms via the 1989 U.S. Congressional Act prescribing the construction of the Smithsonians National Museum of the American Indian and associated issues of identity politics addressed therein."

Of the 12,444 articles, 324 mentioned ethics in some way and were further analyzed in terms of the way in which ethics was discussed. This study represents a first step to a comprehensive content analysis of the nature of ethical discussions in public relations trade publications. Understanding the way in which ethics is discussed may be important to both the theory and the practice of the profession. Until public relations can come to grips with the reasons that public relations, as a profession, ought to act ethically, public relations will not achieve a normative theory of public relations ethics. The two are inherently connected. At a minimum, results from this content analysis can serve as one indicator of where some of these processes might best begin."

Cheongsam, the Chinese national dress, has revived since the 1990s on both in China and in Western societies. This trend is evidenced in American popular media. In two Hollywood movies, Spider Man I (2002) and 50 First Dates (2004), Caucasian American women wear the Chinese national dress, cheongsam (qi pao). Unlike American movies engaging in Chinese issues or Chinese produced nostalgic and martial arts/gangster movies in which cheongsam naturally appears, the stories of these two movies have nothing to do with Chinese. I shall call this new presence of cheongsam dislocation of cheongsam. Through a close look at the representation of cheongsam wearing by the leading actresses in these two movies mentioned above at the textual level and the intertextual level, I argue that the cheongsams in Spider Man I and 50 First Dates help to reinforce the well-established Orientalism discourse, and the unequal relationship between the East and the West, although the cheongsam in 50 First Dates carries some extent of ambiguity."

Lately, a new type of comedy show has emerged in Germany: the so-called Ethno-Comedies, i.e., comedy shows containing mostly ethnic and interethnic jokes. This study presents selected results of the first qualitative content analysis of the forerunner of ethnic comedy shows in Germany, the show Was guckst du?!. Focusing on the central issues of ethnic humor and stereotyping, it provides examples of ethnic and interethnic jokes and explains mechanisms how peculiarities of ethnic groups can be employed in order to create humorous effects."

The first task of an experimental study had Asian American users read four pieces of disease-related information presented by two Asian and two White male agents. Both strong and weak ethnic identifiers perceived the Asian agents more expert and trustworthy than the White agents for presenting primarily Asian-related information and the White agents more expert and trustworthy than the Asian agents for presenting primarily White-related information. In the second task, both strong and weak ethnic identifiers were more likely to endorse an Asian agent than a White agent for Asian-related health foods Web sites and endorse a White agent than an Asian agent for White-related health foods Web sites. The results suggest a matching effect between agent ethnicity and the ethnic relevance of information."

Depending on the users decisions and actions in a game, every player creates his or her individual game content. Knowledge about this individual game content is crucial for the evaluation of potential effects of media usage on cognitions, affects, and behavior. This study analyses the individually generated content of a typical first-person-shooter game with high temporal resolution. 13 experienced game player played the typical multiplayer first-person-shooter game Tactical Ops.  Assault on Terror for 50 minutes on average. Playing phases and transitions between playing phases are analyzed on both an intra-player and inter-player level. Continuous physiological response measures (heart rate, skin conductance) are associated with game content, revealing distinct arousal levels for different game playing phases, events, and transitions. Discussion of results addresses the question whether physiological responses are able to validate event-related, longitudinal content analyses and whether they indicate immediate media effects."

A previous study found that the quotes used to exemplify public opinion in a news story predicted partisans perceptions of story bias and its influence on others. The current study examined the extent to which anecdotes that exemplified misdeeds committed by members of a partisan group affected group and non-group members perceptions of story bias, thus further testing the ability of exemplification theory to explain the HME. The study also added a new variable to the study of the HME: intent to continue to consume news produced by the offending source. Anecdotal exemplification did not predict hostile media judgments. However, hostile media judgments were associated with less intent to read the given paper and stories by the given reporter in the future."

The purpose of this study was to determine what sources provide adolescents with information about sun exposure and melanoma-preventive behaviors, focusing on parents, the media, and school. Understanding information sources would provide insight into how positive attitudes and efficacy may be developed, as well as the possibility of influencing the subjective norm, according to the theory of planned behavior. Differences in attitudes and behaviors among youth who use parents, media, both, or neither as sources were examined in a random survey of 200 adolescents ages 10-18 in a Midwestern state. Depending on source, adolescents listed either skin cancer or sunburn as the best reason to wear sunscreen, but those who relied on media only were least likely to use sunscreen and slightly more likely to sunbathe and use tanning beds. Gender and age findings supported previous studies."

Also important is whether Rokeachs Comprehensive Theory of Change facilitates understanding Israeli educators rationale for resolving value conflicts created by access to Internet-generated popular culture. Jerusalem elementary school computer coordinators completed a mail questionnaire in Hebrew, which was translated to English for data analysis. Computer coordinators offered a unique perspective because they have much experience in facilitating the implementation of computer and Internet usage with classroom teachers and students. The key finding was that secular and the religious educators, based on their own frame of reference, have learned to manage conflicting Internet popular culture messages, in order to maintain stability and consistency for themselves and their students."

Drawing on a small number of studies from emerging media markets, the authors argue that the relationship between competition and the quality of the journalistic product is curvilinear, with an optimal level of competition producing a quality media product and higher levels of competitionsuch as the hyper-competition existing in many emerging media marketsproducing journalistic products that do not serve society well.
The paper examines this question empirically through use of existing data from a small sample of countries where measures of media performance and of market competition exist. The findings are consistent with the expectation of a curvilinear (inverted U) relationship between competition and the quality of journalistic products in that country."

One reason for this failure is the inability to view organizational power as anything other than domination. Moreover, the continual emphasis on domination has resulted in the tendency to see key theoretical resources on power, particularly Michel Foucault, through the lens of domination

This paper will focus on the way in which scholars of organizational communication have inherited and in many cases reproduced an understanding of power as domination and used Foucault to further those reproductions. The first part of this article focuses on the how of our inherited tradition, answering the question of How has domination been passed down by organizational communication scholarship? In the second part, I offer an analysis of the why of our inherited tradition, which seeks to explore the question of Why have we embraced and re-produced a link between Foucaults work on Power and domination? Finally, I will examine the implications of this inherited tradition and how a rethinking and expansion of Michel Foucaults work on power could have a significant impact on the scholarship of organizational communication and its ability to examine alternative constructs of power."

It is hypothesized that gender and national identity have a significant effect on selective exposure to entertainment series. Two international quasi-experimental studies have been conducted, the first study in the U.S. and Germany (N = 419) and the second in Great Britain and Germany (N = 154). As expected, participants rated series that feature protagonists of their own sex higher than those that featured protagonists of the opposite sex. However, national identity did not have the effects expected. Participants from all three countries gave similar ratings to series produced in their home-country as those produced abroad. The use of SIT is discussed in terms of what processes of the theory are of particular importance to explain media related behavior and how to empirically apply the theory in media effects research to make it work. A two-process model of SIT in media effects research is suggested: the processes referring to selective exposure elicited by similarities and dissimilarities on the one hand and by social comparison on the other."

Building on earlier work, this research expanded the individual level components of multilevel transactive memory systems by studying how usage of both human and non-human knowledge repositories influenced access to information. Structural equation modeling tests supported a significant relationship between usage of non-human organizational knowledge repositories and access to information. Follow up research supported a significant relationship between direct resource exchange with team members (the human repositories) and access to information only among average-level users of organizational knowledge repositories. The results also showed that the development of individual expertise directories significantly influenced resource exchange with group members. Also, perceived usage of organizational knowledge repositories by team members significantly influenced actual usage, confirming social cognitive theory. Consistent with the findings from earlier research, technology-specific competence in using intranets significantly influenced the actual usage of intranets as organizational knowledge repositories.

Experiential engagement is used as a comprehensive term for aspects of perceiving immediacy to events, characters and emotions in a story, and encompasses phenomena like transportation into narrative, identification, and perceived realism. A study was conducted to test whether experiential engagement results in an increase of enjoyment, and to determine the role of general dispositions of individuals for experiential engagement in predicting enjoyment. To account for genre differences, movies from three different genres (science fiction, romantic comedy, and crime thriller) were used as stimuli to evoke responses of experiential engagement. Results demonstrate that the disposition of transportability, measured days before viewing films, predicts involvement while viewing stimulus films. Results also suggest that perceived realism in terms of correspondence to the real world and coherence within the fictional world, as well as identification with characters may causally precede transportation into and enjoyment of films."

It encourages a dynamic view of knowledge creation and coordination in organizations as a complex transactive memory system (Wegner, 1995) based on networks. Hereby, it focuses on the nonlinear interaction dynamics between three types of networks: The social connections between knowledge agents, the relationships between domains of organizational knowledge, and the network of organizational actions, encapsulated in routines. It is proposed that the cognitive instantiation of these networks in the minds of organization members (cognitive sogical structures, cause maps, scripts, and schemata) influence how organization members share knowledge and create it. Complexity concepts such as fitness landscapes and searches for local optima (Levinthal & Warglien, 1999) are explored are explained and applied to the ways in which organization members identify knowledgeable others and interact with them. It is argued that based on complex thinking, the nonlinear interactivity between the three kinds of networks together with the interdependence of agents provides explanations for the creative and emergent aspects of organizational knowledge. Further, complexity theory holds the promise of reconciling interpretive and positivist knowledge research and applies to both tacit and explicit kinds of knowledge. Computational modeling as a complex methodological approach is discussed."

Based on Balance Theory, it was predicted that if employees had more similar perceptions on organizational climate with their workplace friend(s), they would be more satisfied with their jobs. Also it was tested if similarity with one best friend was more strongly related to an employees job satisfaction than similarity with a group of friends. Eighty-one employees from two organizations completed questionnaires. The data were not consistent with the hypothesis predicting positive relationship between similarity in climate with friends and job satisfaction. The finding was that the similarity in responsibility (i.e., one dimension of climate) with workplace friends was negatively related to employees job satisfaction. The data also showed that the similarity in responsibility with a group of friends was significantly related to employees job satisfaction, while the similarity in responsibility with one best friend was not. Finally, implications and limitations of these findings were discussed."

In particular, it is argued that when there is discrepancy between perceived external images and internally perceived images that are held by employees, it can result in significant consequences in terms of employees behaviors. Furthermore, it is discussed how perceptions about organizational images are related to internal and external communication and the need for an integrative perspective of communication management in the organization. Finally, several practical implications to communication practitioners in the organizations are discussed."

In recent years, the perceived source of a firms competitive advantage has shifted from tangible economic assets to knowledge or intellectual capital. This paper seeks to re-orient our thinking about formal and informal organizational forms from a knowledge-based perspective. To this end, a focus on knowledge as competitive advantage highlights changes to formal organizational hierarchies and the emergence of intra- and interorganizational knowledge networks. Moreover, it is proposed that potential constraints may hinder a firms ability to compete in a knowledge-based economy. Such constraints include, but are not limited to, the need for a common language and prior-related knowledge as a function of the limited cognitive abilities of employees and firms, and cultural variability within and across firms."

Results show that while romantically unfulfilled people avoided films containing romance themes, they were less likely than romantically happy people to select positively-valenced films and to avoid negatively-valenced films. In addition to Zillmanns mood management theory, findings are discussed in terms of various social contexts and situations which may prime different types of motivations and goals of media uses."
2006-0518,Exploring Predictors of Adoption of Wireless Internet among Academics,Communication and Technology High Density Session,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Exploring Predictors of Adoption of Wireless Internet among Academics,Communication and Technology High Density Session,"Academics are pioneering adopters and users of the Internet. This study examines the diffusion of Wi-Fi driven wireless Internet systems among academics. Using a probability sample drawn from faculty of a research university in the Southeast, results indicate that the pace and rate of adopting the Wi-Fi technology resembles that of the general population. About 21.4% are found as early users, 55.2% are likely users, and 23.4% are non-users. More important, results demonstrate that the dynamics of individual, social, and technological influences characterizes the adoption of the high-speed wireless Internet among academics. Consistent with previous adoption studies among non-academic populations, perceived advantage-compatibility, change agent contacts, and social influences from family and colleagues predict the diffusion of wireless Internet with all predictors taken into consideration. The influence of newspaper reading, however, is negative. The more time respondents spend reading newspapers, the less likely they will adopt and use the wireless system."

Much research is focused on exploration and verification of conceptual dimensions of organization-public relationships that were suggested by scholars such as Ledingham and Bruning and Grunig and Huang. However, empirical research that explores specific communication methods that lead to the development of organization-public relationships is scarce. The purpose of this research was in part to fill that void. In particular, this research focuses on exploration of Hon and J. Grunigs relationship cultivation strategies by conducting a case study on an organizations community relations practice."
2006-0520,Exploring the Boundary Conditions of Knowledge in Knowledge Management,Knowledge Networks and Complex Systems,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Exploring the Boundary Conditions of Knowledge in Knowledge Management,Knowledge Networks and Complex Systems,"Knowledge management entails the processes of creating, storing/retrieving, transferring, and applying knowledge, often through information and communication technologies. Scholarly debate surrounding the philosophical underpinnings of knowledge has largely overshadowed the importance of these processes. In returning to an investigation of knowledge management, this paper explores how various aspects of context and individual expertise place limitations on the extent to which knowledge can be shared and applied. More specifically, context is examined in terms of its physical, activity-oriented, social, and cultural properties. The limitations posed by context and expertise are described as boundary conditions, holding the potential to hinder KM processes. This paper explores these boundary conditions by looking at how they influence knowledge that is shared (and subsequently applied) through knowledge repositories."
2006-0521,Exploring the Impact of Continuous Response Measurement Displays on Viewers Perceptions of Media Messages,Processes and Effects Studies,Information Systems,,,Paper,Exploring the Impact of Continuous Response Measurement Displays on Viewers Perceptions of Media Messages,Processes and Effects Studies,"To what extend, if any, can the display of continuous response measurement results concurrently with a media message impact viewers perceptions of and evaluative judgments toward both the presenters and content of the messages? In order to address this question female and male research volunteers were exposed to and evaluated two performance music videos of approximately 2 minutes duration. In each experimental session the first music video was presented unmanipulated. The second music video, on the other hand, incorporated one of three experimental manipulations simulating a continuous response measurement (CRM) graphic that was overlaid onto the video image. Perceptions of the music video performers and performances served as the dependent variables. The findings revealed that following exposure to the negative CRM graphic overlay viewers judged both the performer and the music video performance more negatively suggesting that CRM graphic overlays can be a powerful device for influencing people's judgments."

A Web-based survey was conducted at a major southwest university to understand wireless Internet adoption rate, media use and computer use. The major finding was the roaming degree was a consequence of wireless Internet adoption and a determinant of online news reading. Also, wireless Internet adoption antecedes the relationship of the time one spends on computers per day and online news reading."
2006-0523,Exploring the Priming Effect of Violent Video Games on Subsequent Media Content Selection,Understanding the Role of Emotion in Processing Media,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,Exploring the Priming Effect of Violent Video Games on Subsequent Media Content Selection,Understanding the Role of Emotion in Processing Media,"According to the media priming literature, exposure to media violence can prime subsequent aggressive behaviors, cognitions, or perceptions. To date, the majority of the literature has been concerned with the presence and display of these primed reactions in social settings. Little work has been conducted to investigate the effect of media content as a priming influence on the selection of subsequent media content. The goal of this project is to investigate how playing a violent video game might impact the selection of a film to be viewed immediately following play.

Participants are randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: play a nonviolent video game, play a violent video game, view a nonviolent film clip, or view violent film clip. After playing the game or viewing the film clip, participants are given a booklet containing film descriptions, modified to highlight the presence or absence of violence in the films. Participants then indicate how much they would like to see a clip from each film.

Based on the priming literature, we expect that participants exposed to violent media (regardless of format) will be more likely to choose a violent movie clip to view than participants exposed to the nonviolent content. Also, we expect that participants who played the violent video game will be more likely to choose an extremely violent movie clip to view than participants who viewed the violent film clip. Finally we expect that these effects will be more pronounced among males and participants with high levels of trait aggression."

Within the last year, the framing of that coverage also changed, when the CDC revealed obesity-related deaths had been significantly overestimated (Flegal, Graubard, Williamson & Gail, 2005). Yet there has been little research on how coverage has impacted weight-loss behavior. Using cross-sectional data from a national sample (N=1,650), we attempted to explore whether media information about obesity was associated with attempted weight loss. Logistic regression analyses revealed that exposure to obesity information was significantly related to weight-loss attempt within the past 30 days (OR=.60, 95% CI=1.37-2.40) when controlling for demographics, health status and BMI. The belief that weight loss would improve looks also significantly predicted behavior (OR=.386, 95% CI=1.12-1.94), but beliefs about health outcomes did not. Interestingly, the belief that genes were more important than behavior in determining health did not prevent respondents from engaging in weight-loss behavior. Implications for public health promoters are discussed."

Forty-two male teams played a cooperative game whereby one person produced clues and a partner guessed the clue category. Several 2 (Alcohol consumption of clue producer: BAC .08 g/dl or sober) x 2 (Game 1 versus Game 3) repeated measure analyses of variance examined the effect of drinking on nonverbal behaviors; regression analyses examined the influence of these variables on game performance. Drinking alcohol largely resulted in the increased use of nonverbal behaviors, and to an extent, greater team success."
2006-0526,Extending Emotional Self to Collaborative Effort of Global Virtual Teams,Globalization and Communication,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Extending Emotional Self to Collaborative Effort of Global Virtual Teams,Globalization and Communication,"Advantages of working virtually are usually associated with functional and structural aspects of global virtual teams. Challenges that virtual teams face are related to the human nature of work relationships such as trust, uncertainty, identification, commitment, and/or leadership, which have been linked to the expressions and experience of emotions. Thus, the present paper seeks to extend our understanding of the role that emotions play in the context of global virtual teams. Expressly, team members adapt to the medium and convey social information about their feelings through the content, style of verbal messages, timing of verbal exchange, and/or simulating nonverbal cues. Finally, I suggest employing Denzins (1984) view of emotions as lived experiences to embrace ambiguity, strength, and elusiveness of peoples emotions."

Liberalization affected the contents and forms of EEEBs in such ways that their contents became more 1) diversified so that they accommodate the differentiation of their society, and 2) focused on economic/practical issues to attract foreign investment and educate their people to let them adapt to capitalized economic system. In addition, EEEBs confronted the stream of regionalization (European community) which posed a challenge in both ways: preserving peculiar culture of each nation and helping people feel the need for setting up the regional community. Content regulation for EEEBs reflects 1) the inertia of censorship since Communist government and 2) absence of democratic content regulation system. Funding is still under significant influence of government, partly because its essential function as an instrument of international public relations have not been changed. Eastern European external broadcasts are utilizing the Internet and satellite as an alternative of shortwave. Suggestions for future research are addressed."

The respondents of the survey were 100 participants in DebateWatch 2004. The findings from the present study were mixed in that: (1) people preferred moderated discussion forums to presidential campaign discourse, (2) moderated discussion forums, if employed effectively, could help alleviate publics cynicism toward political processes and enhance confidence in the political system, and (3) trust was not found to be a reliable determinant of political attitudes. The insignificant differences in political attitudes as a function of trust were surprising; however, it might not be entirely unexpected considering DebateWatch participants on average were rated high in trust and therefore creating realistically high and low trust groups was impossible. In addition, the findings may suggest that more dimensions of trust than benevolence and reliability need to be considered in order to accurately reflect political cynicism."

2006-0530,Factors Influencing Deception Detection: Impairment or Facilitation?,terpersonal Communication Top Papers,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Factors Influencing Deception Detection: Impairment or Facilitation?,Interpersonal Communication Top Papers,"Theories of deception posit competing views of the effects of arousal, emotional state, cognitive load, attempted behavioral control, and motivation on deception detection. The four-factor theory and the motivation impairment effect argue that all of these factors will debilitate nonverbal performance, resulting in more readily detectable deceit. Deceptive verbal performances, however, are posited to be facilitated by motivation, resulting in less accurate detection. Interpersonal deception theory and the choking-under-pressure hypothesis posit that arousal, cognitive effort, behavioral control and motivation should all facilitate performance unless and until they reach extreme levels. The current investigation explored the effects of deception, modality, and induced motivation on these variables and the resultant detectability of deception. Results from a mock theft experiment were more consistent with the latter theoretical perspectives than the former."

Stepwise regression was conducted. The results indicate that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use turned out to have significant effects on behavioral intention. It was also found that perceived ease of use, subjective norm, observability, compatibility, and perceived network externality were positively associated with perceived usefulness. And observability, compatibility, and new communication technology self-efficacy were positively associated with perceived ease of use. Implications for MOD marketing strategies are then discussed."

This paper adopts a definition of inter-organizational collaborations as relationships that leverage the differences among participants and balance divergent stakeholder concerns (Hardy, et al, 2005:58). The paper takes a discursive, constructionist approach in exploring a case of inter-organizational collaboration in dealing with conflict. The case data underscore the role of conversation, language, and talk. Contraversation, that is, dialectical and dialogical conversation, directed against one organization within the network, appeared to construct antagonisms and thwart collaboration. The studys explorations add to propositions in recent research and theory concerning the role of conversations in developing discursive resources that create a collective identity and translate it into effective inter-organizational collaboration to deal with problematic concerns, in this case social conflict."

The principle of familywise correction dictates that, upon conducting multiple tests, alpha should be adjusted (i.e., lower than the conventional .05 level) so that overall Type I error inflation is controlled (e.g., Curran-Everett, 2000; Tukey, 1991). This correctional procedure has recently been disputed by OKeefe (2003), to whose argument the present critique is counterposed. Both thesis and antithesis to familywise alpha adjustment are provided. First, arguments against familywise correction are reviewed with discussions of five interrelated problems. Second, an alternative perspective advocating a sensible application of familywise procedures is explicated; notions of the scope of a null hypothesis and the statistics-theory linkage are highlighted as the grounds of this argument. Along these discussions, general guideline for appropriate uses of familywise adjustment is articulated and alternative techniques recently developed are introduced."

This paper uses content analysis to trace this newly created meaning through a series of gatekeeping failures to a position from which its more ominous meaning is easily inferred  not simply in references to political-religious violence but in discussions of baseball, advertising, and literature. The shared meanings it reflects are the underpinnings of the Orientalism that Said described in the 1970s and 1980s, a pervasive Western discourse built around a fundamental ideology of difference."

We present the results of three experiments that explored how time between posts, size of the community, evidence of moderation, and level of message interactivity affect participation and subjective evaluations of an online community. We found that only message interactivity affected whether or not participants posted comments to an online discussion.

The results of comparison between the baseline model, frequently used in most previous research, and our hypothetical model represent that our model fits the date more satisfactorily. Analysis of structural equation model also revealed the presumed relationship between perception and opinion expression, supporting spiral of silence hypothesis. We also found out that demographic variables were related to the perception of opinion climate as well as opinion expression, locating mediating and intervening role of the perceived congruencies. Feminist perspective and socioeconomic status approach significantly contribute to the enhancement of understating of the spiral of silence model."
2006-0537,Fighting for the Storys Life: Nonclosure in Journalistic Narrative,Narrative Structures of the News,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Fighting for the Storys Life: Nonclosure in Journalistic Narrative,Narrative Structures of the News,"This article proposes non-closure as a category for analyzing sustained news stories, based on the case study of Ron Arad, an Israeli soldier who was taken captive in 1986 and whose story still continues to create headlines in the Israeli press. Coverage of the Arad case was examined in the three major Israeli daily newspapers for a period of 17 years, and the textual mechanisms through which the story has been mythologized and kept alive were identified. The article offers an analysis of three central non-closure devices: maintaining suspense, thickening the plot, and keeping the protagonist alive. It is suggested that these strategies enhanced readers involvement with the journalistic texts and served as a bridge between the ritual and information transmission functions of news. Non-closure is thus conceptualized as a force that operates alongside the well studied forces of closure and renders certain news pieces episodes in a serial narrative rather then simply short stories."

When American melancholy is addresed, its focus is primarily in the realm of psychology and aspects of depression or sadness. Not only has there been little formal research on melancholy in contemporary America, it appears that the state of melancholy is antithetical to American values of success and progress. Germans, on the other hand, have been willing to address melancholy as an issue in the context of German culture. Does this mean then that only Germans are melancholic? Certainly not. This paper examines themes of melancholy in two films -- the German film, ""Gegen die Wand,"" and the American film, ""Sideways."" The analysis indicates surprising similarities in melancholic themes in these two contemporary and popular films."

This work has most often considered workers in front-line service positions in investigations of emotional labor and human service workers in investigations of empathy and emotional work. In this study, we consider processes of both emotional labor and emotional work in the financial planning profession. Financial planners occupy a role requiring ongoing relationships with clients, conversations about the often emotional topic of money, and a need to manage emotion in a variety of interaction contexts. Thus, from extant theory and literature regarding emotion and communication, we proposed research questions regarding the roles of emotional labor and emotional work in the financial planning profession. These questions were investigated in a web-based survey study of almost 300 professional financial planners and supporting interviews with 14 financial planners. Results indicate support for existing theory on emotional work, extensions to current research regarding emotional labor, and important implications for the role of emotion and communication in a range of professional service roles."

A content analysis based on 300 news stories from OhmyNews and Chosun.com showed a number of significant differences. The progressive OhmyNews published news stories that presented Anti-war frame more frequently, while the conservative Chosun.com published news stories that presented Pro-war frame more frequently. This study also showed that the patterns of source selection of both OhmyNews and Chosun.com clearly emphasized one-sided perspective that was consistent with their frames. They included more sources that fit with their basic storyline between anti-war and pro-war, highlighted favorable sources by locating them before unfavorable sources, and reflected those favorable perspectives in their headlines. Thus, this content analysis suggests the patterns of source selection can be one of primary framing devices."

This threat was discussed widely both by e-mail and on Internet message boards, and in the traditional news media. Using the largely untapped potential of the Internet as a means to track the spread of rumors and legends, I present new evidence for the theory that news media foster belief in rumors and legends, even while denying their truth. Using Internet data also allows one to observe the way different media  word of mouth, message boards, chain email warnings, traditional news media  succeed each other as the primary means of transmission."

Using the General Aggression Model, as applied to video games by Anderson and Bushman (2002), the current study measured physiological arousal, state hostility, and how aggressively participants would respond to three hypothetical scenarios. In addition, this study measured each of these variables multiple times in order to gauge how aggression would change with increased video game play. Results showed a significant increase over time in hostility and aggression (based on two of the three story stems), which is consistent with the General Aggression Model. This study adds to the existing literature on video games and aggression by showing that increased play of a violent first person shooter video game can significantly increase aggression from baseline."

Legal procedures allow the defamed party to request a public retraction. However, typical retractions take the form of innuendo that makes it difficult for audiences to receive the retraction as the retractors intend. We found that common expectations about retractions (e.g., a retraction will reduce and cancel reputational damage for the defamed party) are rarely met in reality. The paper examines innuendo effects in light of recipients differential levels of personal relevance toward the message and source credibility of the medium. We review, then, the practical implications of innuendo effects in defamatory situations."

Napster arrived at the confluence of social currents including a decade of institutional spending on networks, intensified focus on teens and young adults as a market, and the rapid commercialization of the Internet in the dot com boom. Napsters importance, it is argued, was as a techno-cultural pheomenon, a totem of a belief system that included both commercial and communal components.
This paper traces the historical roots of Napster and related technologies, but also focuses on the role of American universities in promoting first Internet adoption, then broadband networks as both research and marketing strategies. It also compares the rhetoric of the Internet in the 2000 US presidential elections and the marketing of cool surrounding Internet adoption at the end of the 1990s. It pinpoints the nexus of commercial, educational and political forces that branded the Internet as both a vital economic engine and an emblem of youthful vitality and resistance.
With its irresitable lure of free music, Napster introduced millions to peer networks, open source idealism, and the concept of gift economics, and popularized emerging shifts in producer-consumer relationships. These ideas came to embody the Internet (and especially the World Wide Web) for many users, altering the social and economic positions of global media congomerates and provoking new models of media creation and distribution."

The study seeks evidence of the journalistic values as constants in the news coverage of great changes in China from two time periods: Edgar Snows celebrated foreign correspondence 60 plus years ago during a Civil War and World War with Japans invasion and todays foreign correspondence at the height of Chinas rapid and massive economic changes. Guided by Prior's theoretical conception of text as a product of effect in a particular socio-historical context, textual analysis by themes and values, we examined Snows correspondence in the Saturday Evening Post and other news outlets in the first period, as well as todays correspondence in the Time, Newsweek and U.S News & World Report magazines in the second period. The analysis shows that Snow and the current magazine journalists foreign correspondence from China displayed many of the Gans values, but the values appear more enduring today, more blatant in todays correspondence. The former traditional elite foreign correspondent living in China has been replaced by parachute correspondents."

Our study attempts to answer the following two key questions: (1) What sector of the worlds geopolitical landscape did China national television news consider to be salient in its survey of the external reality? (2) How did the construction of foreign news and views change over time? Taking advantage of three sets of actual videotapes of CCTV News collected in China in 1992, 1998 and 2004, this study seeks to compare how the news and views related to the world out there changed over time. We find that the decline of cold war frame on CCTV is plausibly a reflection of Chinas increasing pragmatism in its approach to the outside world and the realism in its international diplomatic activities."

I will begin with a focus on the public sphere and explore three important concerns of the public sphere with respect to space the convergence of private and public interests and the role of media in discursive construction of space. I will consider the role of space with respect to access to the discursive sphere and conversely the role of the sphere in access to space. Thirdly, taking into consideration cross-disciplinary perspectives, I will propose possible research questions that may intervene in the debates about public space and communication."
2006-0560,Frame Building and Frame Setting: The Interplay Between Online Public Opinion and Media Coverage,Framing in the News,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Frame Building and Frame Setting: The Interplay Between Online Public Opinion and Media Coverage,Framing in the News,"This study applies framing theory to examine the interplay between online public discourse and offline media discourse. Employing a content analysis of 206 online postings and 114 news reports regarding a sociopolitical incident in China, we test the associations and causal relationships between opinion frames and media frames. Statistical results partially support frame-building and frame-interacting effects, but reject the frame-setting hypothesis. Online public opinion plays an important role in transforming the original event into an issue. It also exerts a significant impact upon subsequent media frames at the early stage of news coverage. However, the media are not passive in this two-way process, adapting online frames as necessary. Although media coverage is the primary source of information for netizens, it has little frame-setting impact on online discourse. Discussion focuses on the potential of press freedom and credibility as intervening variables and on the implications for the study of public opinion formation."

Such characterizations of blacks encourage news consumers to blame blacks for their own oppression. Moreover, mainstream news coverage of this kind reproduces dominant ideologies of white superiority and black inferiority that may conceal racial meanings that shape public policy debates. While there has been profound speculation about the effects of degrading depictions of blacks on public policy and popular legal trials in the U.S., not much has been known about the direct effects and consequences of antiblack news images on public policy and government officials responses to crisis -- until Katrina.
In this paper, we describe and explain recurrent characterizations of black residents of New Orleans as shooters, looters, and aggressors in major Western English-language television and newsprint stories of Hurricane Katrina from August 29 to September 6, 2005. Using critical discourse analysis, we highlight the dominant archetypal and narrative structures constructed by mainstream media discourse and show how they rearticulate the black brute, a violent and sexually aggressive black male caricature that emerged in American popular culture during the late nineteen century, generating widespread discrimination and violence against blacks. We will argue that contemporary brute and victim characterizations disseminated by mainstream news coverage of Katrina perpetuate and legitimate anti-black racist myths, and even worse, contributed to delayed and restrained responses to the disaster by government officials and organizations."

This study examined frames in nine of the 34 Senates races from 2004 to examine the type, source, and target of frames used in campaign newspaper coverage. Horse-race strategy frames were the most common frames overall and a preferred instrument of reporters. Partisan sources tended to provide policy frames while non-partisan sources were usually involved with strategy frames.
When partisan sources did provide policy frames, they applied the frames to themselves more than two-thirds of the time, focusing on issues and topics involved with the campaigns. In addition, reporter-sourced frames were more likely focus on Republicans than Democrats by a margin of 55 percent to 45 percent"

Likewise, numerous studies have demonstrated the power of elite frames to influence opinion, but almost none include competing frames. Using gay marriage frames, I find that elite debate moderates the impact of framing only when competing frames exert independent, opposite effects. This is the case both for effects on policy views (persuasion) and for effects on the importance of predispositions. I also find further evidence of the boomerang effect (Gross 2000), or the backlash that occurs when citizens exposed to frames strongly at odds with their predispositions become even stronger proponents of their initial views. Indeed, exposure to the frames did not cause citizens to abandon their predispositions. I also analyze spillover effects of the gay marriage frames on views about legalizing adoption for gay couples and find a similar pattern of effects for persuasion. Finally, I discuss the utility of my results for understanding the dynamics of the continuing debate about gay marriage and caution that my results should be taken as suggestive rather than definitive for theories of elite influence and competition."

This paper uses framing analysis and critical discourse analysis of the New York Times articles and PR Week commentaries to analyze case of Armstrong Williams, syndicated journalist who was paid through Ketchum Public Relations to promote government initiative No Child Left Behind. This case implicates both professions, that of journalists in their responsibility to their audiences, and that of public relations practitioners, in their obligation for transparency. In this paper, the ethical and moral considerations of both professions were critically analyzed. The goal of this paper, then, is twofold: to reconceptualize the academic discourse about journalism ethics and professionalism as well as public relations ethics and professionalism. This paper asks: How does public relations practice and journalism practice relate/differ in their respective practitioners understanding of professionalism? Finally, this paper asks how does the Williams case address the professional social framework of journalistic and public relations practice?"

The purpose is to determine the effectiveness of the global joint counterterrorism effort. A content analysis of these two newspapers coverage reveals that the U.S. state actors propagated Islamic militants, radical jihadists, and Al-Qaeda fighters as terrorists, in contrast to Ugandan state actors who propagated guerrilla fighters, rebel warlords, opposition politicians, and activists as terrorists. Chi square results show that there are significant differences in framing terrorism by the U.S. state actors and the Ugandan state actors. This article concludes by potentially showing how the war on global terrorism may last for generations unabated, if the current trends of the global joint counterterrorism effort continue un-scrutinized by the news media."

In this content analysis, the cover images were examined to see how camera shots vary with the characteristics of the featured figures and the tone of the cover story. Four shot categories were offered to analyze the shot distance in printed media.
On the basis of the proxemic theory of camera shots, we suggested three basic hypotheses: 1) U.S. political leaders is associated with medium and close-up shots, which are believed to bring the viewer into a comfortable relationship with the object, while non-U.S. leaders is associated with extreme close-up shots, the most emotional and often uncomfortable camera distance; 2) Positive news is associated with the close-up shot while negative news is with the extreme close-up shot; and 3) Because deciding the shot distance is conventional routine in visual journalism, there is consistency in the distance use across the magazines. The results confirmed the hypotheses, implying that shot distance contributes to the attempt to control meanings and emotions."

This study conducted a content analysis of news reports in order to examine the media construction of reality of the information society. The findings of news frame analysis showed the existence of a pro-utopian frame in both countries' news coverage. Several important similarities can be summarized with these two phrases: ""Episodic utopia versus Thematic anti-utopia,"" and ""Economic utopia versus Social anti-utopia."" Regarding differences, Korean newspapers were inclined to approach the information society with a nation-oriented perspective, whereas the U.S. exhibited an individual-oriented approach. As a result, the Korean press showed a strong nationalistic tendency in its news coverage of the information society and was far more likely to use the information society as a rallying flag to compete with other nations."

To conduct this research, two theories (theory of social construction of reality and media framing theory) and one research method (framing analysis) are used for analyzing media texts. According to findings, The New York Times and Washington Post showed a similar trend to portray North Korea. An anti-North Korea frame dominated the news coverage of North Korea in both newspapers. Furthermore, this study reveals that most news articles related to North Korea were classified into negative images instead of positive images. The U.S. newspapers framed the national image of North Korea through evil, enemy, blackmailer, and poor country images, whereas the newspapers did not used positive images such as friend when the newspapers portrayed North Korea."
2006-0569,Framing Theory and Research: Implications for the Practice of Journalism,Constructing Images: Journalism and Framing,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Framing Theory and Research: Implications for the Practice of Journalism,Constructing Images: Journalism and Framing,"Since the late 1960s, frame analysis research has developed steadily as a way of understanding how media influence public perceptions of the social world. Early work by Erving Goffman has been elaborated by a number of important researchers including William Gamson and Herbert Gans. In this paper we argue that frame analysis could become the basis for a new way of practicing journalism  framing journalism. Framing journalism would be grounded in the view that news must be framed in order to be understood. This view raises fundamental questions about a long accepted and cherished tenet of journalism  the notion that news stories can and should be objective. It assumes that construction of the social world is not an activity that everyone controls equally. Journalists have to become proactive in introducing news users to a range of frames that they can use to interpret various types of news. To do this they need to form an alliance with framing researchers. We have summarized suggestions that framing researchers have offered for the practice of journalism. These suggestions give some indication of how framing research could contribute to the practice of journalism. We have also indicated how framing journalism might be implemented."

Two U.S. Newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington Post, and two Chinese newspapers, the People's Daily Online and China Daily, were selected for study due to their prominent media status in their respective countries. The study found different media frames in these newspapers in their coverage of the Iraq War. While the two US newspapers framed the Iraq War as a war aiming at toppling Seddam Hussein and free Iraqi people from Seddam dictatorship, the two Chinese newspapers framed the Iraq War as an invasion of Iraq territory, a violation of UN charter. The government stand of the two countries on the issues of the Iraq War and their respective attitudes toward the Iraq War probably determined the way the Iraq War was framed in different media. The study revealed that in international news coverage, especially in times of international conflict, government stand and cultural value often top all other factors in shaping media reporting. This study also found that Chinese newspapers strongly delegitimized the War, and that while the two US newspapers didn't show an obvious effort to try to legitimize the War, patriotism did play a big role in their news coverage of the War."

Comparing Newspaper Framing of the Iraq War in Four Western Countries,Discourse About Iraq and the War on Terrorism,"In this paper we compare the newspaper framing of the Iraq-issue in four Western countries (US, UK, Germany and the Netherlands) for the period September 2002 till August 2003. Using computer assisted coding based on wordlists constructed by human coders, we analyzed more than 70.000 articles in 12 newspapers. Results show that fluid elements of the countries political opportunity structures influenced the coverage: in countries participating in the war newspapers made more use of causes- and protest-frames and coverage was slightly more positive than in the country that opposed the war. Left leaning and quality newspapers were less positive towards the issue and made more use of the protest-frame compared to right leaning and popular newspapers. The stage of the conflict turned out to be of importance: the causes-frame was most often employed in the build-up stage, the intervention frame during the war and the consequences-frame afterwards."

We conducted a survey among 881 adolescents (10- to 19-year-olds) who had an online profile (i.e., a homepage including self-descriptions and photos) on a Dutch friend networking site. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the frequency with which adolescents used the site had an indirect effect on their self-esteem and well-being. The use of the friend networking site stimulated (a) the number of relationships formed on the site, (b) the frequency with which adolescents received feedback on their profiles, and (c) the tone (i.e., positive vs. negative) of this feedback. Positive feedback on the profiles enhanced adolescents self-esteem and well-being, whereas negative feedback decreased their self-esteem and well-being."

Business is therefore at the forefront of information acquisition, analysis, and storage. One technological solutions to the struggle to observe and control information is the use of individual identification technologies (IITs) such as barcodes and RFIDs. These technologies emerged over the last fifty years as irreplaceable technologies for the control and management of inventory information. As the capabilities of IITs and data management systems have grown, information surveillance has expanded from managing warehoused goods to linking consumed items to their consumers. Consumer concerns with barcode technology resulted from its unfamiliarity and suspicions over its reliability. These initial fears were allayed over time, only to be replaced by new privacy concerns associated with the expanded use of IITs. As IITs assumed a central role in supply chain, businesses began track customer behavior as well as that of their inventories making companies more responsive to changing market demands.. These business practices and their attendant privacy concerns became the starting point for consumer advocates critiquing a newer IIT  Radio Frequency Identification devices (RFIDs). RFIDs promise an even greater degree of information collection and control dealing with goods and consumers. The economic arguments for the use of IITs and drive their adoption by businesses, are compelling to businesses and consumers. However, consumers become alarmed when the information gathered and analyzed is personally identifiable. The story of IITs is a story about the struggle for control of information by organizations and individuals."

This essay aims to contribute to our understanding of CSR by examining its discursive relationship with sustainable development, and then unpacking and critiquing three assumptive bases of conventional sustainable development discourse. The essay concludes by revisiting the connection between CSR and sustainable development and argues that emergent alternative understandings of sustainability might be better facilitated by treating ethical corporate communication in terms of social accountability rather than corporate responsibility."

A content analysis shows that the family on Good Times was friendlier and more supportive of each other than the family on My Wife and Kids. In contrast, the My Wife and Kids family was significantly more likely to show tension and be unfriendly towards each other. In addition, the earlier family representations were more mother-focused, with all family members being equally represented; the later representations were more father-focused, with the husband and wife as the source of most interactions. These results support the notion that transformations in the portrayals of African Americans may have led to these changes in family dynamics, as blacks are no longer presented as fighting to survive but as experiencing universal trials that plague every American household."

To find a possible solution to the communication dilemma, this study compared the performances of two communication structures -- one based on the interpersonal networks (NEX) and the other based on a public electronic bulletin board (GEX). In a 2 x 2 x 2 longitudinal between-subject experiment, it was found that changing GEX to NEX could increase the level of contributions made by individuals. Furthermore, NEX was found to be an effective structure for N-person communication particularly when a large number of individuals were involved. The findings imply that an individuals cooperative motivation is a function of the incentive structure of a particular form of information exchange, which means that altering the exchange form may be a possible solution to the communication dilemmas in virtual communities."

High-profile national campaigns have learned how to take advantage of on line tools not only to communicate their message, but more importantly to mobilize supporters and provide incentives and opportunities for e-volunteers to become engaged in the process. Among of the most significant developments in the 2004 election were the strategies and tools that the e-campaign staffs designed to make sure that on line engagement could be transferred off line as well, thus augmenting the campaigns field operations in an election where the ground game proved to be a crucial asset. These topics are addressed through in-depth qualitative interviews with senior aides to the e-campaigns of George W. Bush and John F. Kerry in 2004. On line political communication professionals predict that in the future the internet will become an increasingly more relevant tool in campaigns and that its functions will be adopted all through the campaign organization."

Unlike other groups established online, CY has a form of a state. CY has its emblems, governmental structure, as well as the Constitution, and it issues its own digital passports.
The chapter outlines both historic and symbolic links between ""real"" Yugoslavia and its online namesake. To explain this relationship, the development of the Yugoslav national idea from the nineteenth century origins to the present times is described.
Further analysis presented in the essay seeks to explain reasons behind the fact that Cyber Yugoslavia has developed into a large, international community consisting of 16,573 members from 150 countries. In the chapter I argue that Cyber Yugoslavia is not an attempt of constructing Yugoslav or any other national identity on the Internet, but an attempt of deconstructing national identity as such."

Health care providers need practical information that explores how to provide respectful, supportive care for transsexual patients. This paper proposes ways to frame research from the SRS provider and staff perspective to explore how they address the combination of physical treatment, palliative care, emotional support, and empathy for this special patient population. First, I provide an overview of the historical background of sex reassignment surgery and define key terms as used in this proposal. Then I review the major literature in two areas: transsexual and transgender research and health communication. Following this review, I will address proposed fields of inquiry that may bridge the gap between these two disciplines, as well as proposing specific research questions."

VOMPs use trained mediators and face-to-face meetings between victims and offenders to facilitate restorative--as opposed to retributive--justice. Convincing evidence indicates this process works, but VOMPs struggle to overcome the ""liability of newness,"" with only half of the start-up programs in the U.S. surviving. This study assumes that a key factor affecting a program's likelihood of success is the communication network the program establishes. Drawing on institutionalization and communication network literature, this study hypothesizes that the communication networks of successful VOMPs will exhibit relatively greater range, density, and prominence. Additionally, the individual links that constitute the network will display greater equity and multiplexity. Using pattern matching case study methodology, this predicted pattern is matched against the communication networks of twelve VOMPs in the U.S., half of which are successful and half of which are struggling. The results support the hypotheses. In addition, the results suggest that building coalitions and maximizing the strength of weak ties are also important attributes of the networks of successful Victim Offender Mediation Programs."

In this regard, the telephone, in both its traditional wired form and its newer wireless incarnation, offers an interesting case for examining utopian and dystopian technological discourses. Both modes of telephony have arisen within spectacular metaphors of connectivity and community as well as fragmentation and alienation. This paper compares social discourses in the historical development and integration of the telephone and the mobile phone into American life, based on the belief that new communication technologies are always introduced within familiar patterns embedded in other social and cultural practices. The final section maps out truly new areas in which mobile telephony is merging, amplifying, or substituting networks of personal, political, and popular communication."

Internships have been lauded as an opportunity to learn about the workplace firsthand, but scholars have not examined how exposure to negative workplace trends influences interns job expectations and workplace perceptions. This paper addresses these questions in two studies. First, interns at organizations where employees have low morale, have experienced layoffs, and fear future layoffs, are proposed to develop pessimistic perceptions of the internship organization as well as how a typical organization treats employees. Second, the value of internships versus interpersonal sources for work-related information is evaluated, as well as how exposure to downsizing and job insecurity through internships and discussions with parents and friends influences interns expectations for their future employment relationship. In general, results indicate that interns at organizations with low morale, downsizing, and job insecurity will be more pessimistic about the internship organization and the typical organizational culture. Internships are valued more than discussions with parents and friends as sources for work-related information. Interns at organizations where job insecurity is prevalent will expect less trust and support in their future employment relationship, but discussions about downsizing and job insecurity with interpersonal sources were not significantly related to interns expectations for trust, organizational support, or job security."

Not only do computer games represent a new mode of experiencing textuality, they are also becoming an integral part of the current transformation of our experience of space. Computer gameplay only makes sense in spatial structures and computer games themselves in fact constitute an elaborate form of practical discourse on spatiality. Gameplay is linked inseparably to the way we gain orientation and spatial understanding in our navigation of the everyday world. Computer games do not function as allegories or as poor imitations of the real but feed back into our understanding of lived space, into the decisions we make as we orientate and move in the world of consensus reality. The omnicrisis in the imperial world, whereby sovereignty shifts beyond the auspices of the nation state to the flows of the global digital economy, demands a reconceptualisation of power and, following Lefebvre, such a reconceptualisation begins necessarily with space. Computer games are an important component in this reconceptualisation. Drawing on sociological and philosophical discussions of the unsettled zone of our social being by Lefebvre, Soja, Luhmann and others, we examine and critique the applicability of the concept of Thirdspace, a space which is both lived and imagined, to the discussion of the way playing computer games is transforming our experience of spatiality."

Pools and feeds are defined as systems by which one or only a few cameras which distribute video to a wider number of news organizations. Such arrangements are usually arranged through negotiations between representatives of state and news organizations, and are enforced as administrative rules or formal laws. Video pools and feeds constitute a specialized form of information subsidy, with inherent controls and influences on media characterizations and coverage. Using extended interviews with government administrators, news producers and photographers; textual analysis and field visits, this project analyzes video pool and video feed practices and their implications for the public sphere. Special attention is focused on work routines and tangible photographer experience and the implications for the nature of the news images that appear in the public domain."

Pearson correlations, regression analysis and factor analysis found privilege or its absence significant for all three issues. If children are affected (Boy Scouts or same-sex adoption), a buffer hypothesis appears confirmed: The larger the proportion of privileged groups (college education or family income), the more favorable the coverage of (gay) rights claims. By contrast, the higher the vulnerability in a city (percents below poverty levels or unemployed), the less favorable the coverage of a gay issue not involving children: Same-sex marriage. Percent Catholic is significantly associated with favorable coverage of all three gay rights issues. Rotated factor analysis and regression of factors reveal two factors each accounted for 56 percent of the coverage variance for gays in the Boy Scouts, 57 percent for same-sex adoption, and 33 percent for same-sex marriage. Regional Media Vectors and public opinion were mostly aligned for all three gay rights issues, with both newspapers and public viewpoints most favorable to gays in the Northeast, both less favorable to gays in the South and Midwest."

They lacked necessary skills to make use of new media and they had many negative attitudes about these media. This research documented a gender gap that could have had long-term consequences. Recent research has reported that the gender gap is closing in some parts of the world but not in others. While American women are using new media at levels that compare to those of men, European women are lagging behind.
In this study, we have assessed changes in womens use of new media over the past five years using survey data collected at three universities in the US, Germany and New Zealand. In Germany and the US we have data collected annually from 2001 to 2005. In New Zealand we have data from 2005.
Findings show that the gender gap in the use of all forms of new media has closed in the US. In Germany there is still a gap for computer and Internet use but no gap for SMS and cell phone use. There is ample evidence that women are developing skills they need to use new media technology effectively. In the US they excel at using computers for instant messaging while in New Zealand they excel at text messaging. Women at all three universities see new media as providing useful ways to stay in touch with friends and people who share their interests."

Manifestation of these strategies was measured in terms of affect, purchase intent, cue response, and assessment of a target attribute in response to viewing a wordmark with opposing word meaning and typeface connotation. Gender and product-category involvement were shown to be significant influences on attitude and attribute evaluation.

2006-0605,Gender Differences in Third-Person Perceptions About Body Image and Exposure to Reality Makeover Television Shows,Advances in Effects Research I,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Gender Differences in Third-Person Perceptions About Body Image and Exposure to Reality Makeover Television Shows,Advances in Effects Research I,"Using a survey of college women and men, we examined third-person perception as it related to body image distortion in women and men and five target other groups. Participants were shown an image of a thin-ideal swimsuit model (women) or a muscular swimsuit model (men) and were asked to project how repeated exposure to images like the one viewed would affect themselves and others. We expanded the traditional test of third-person perception by controlling for social physique anxiety, a psychosocial scale that measures ones fear of his/her physique being negatively evaluated by others, in order to determine if participants high in physique anxiety would project greater effects on self than on others. To a large degree, our findings suggest that the college students in our sample predicted exposure to thin-ideal/muscular media would affect other target groups more than themselves. Findings from our test of the age-based dimension of social distance suggest that the magnitude of the perceptual gap between perceived effects on the self and target others who were significantly younger and more socially distant did not increase as predicted but decreased. Social physique anxiety did increase first person effects for men and for women, and male and female respondents who reported higher exposure to reality makeover programming were more likely to endorse plastic surgery in American women in general, other college women their age, and themselves (for female respondents). These and other findings are discussed."
2006-0606,"Gendered Affiliation: The Arts as ""Effeminate""",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,"Gendered Affiliation: The Arts as ""Effeminate""",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,"This paper looks at the general idea of gendered affiliation, or activities that are associated with a particular gender. In addressing this issue, one specific example is analyzed: that of participation in, or affinity for, the arts. The general perception of the arts as effeminate is a long-acknowledged but little-discussed example of gendered affiliation. The paper elaborates the following points: First, that our perceptions of appropriate gender characteristics derive from our traditional understandings and enactments of gender roles and attitudes  and that these are socially constructed and culturally bound; second, that in the United States, at least, the arts are perceived as effeminate and that the feminine gender orientation continues to carry with it a negative social connotation; and third, that these attitudes and behaviors can and do change over time, but not quickly nor without struggle."
2006-0607,Gender in Print Advertisements: A Snapshot of Representations from Around the World,Gender and Culture in Visual Signs,Visual Studies,,,Paper,Gender in Print Advertisements: A Snapshot of Representations from Around the World,Gender and Culture in Visual Signs,"A worldwide content analysis of magazine advertisements from 108 countries in 48 languages examining images of men and women revealed stereotypical gender portrayals. This research is like no other in the number of countries and includes nations that are rarely studied, such as Botswana, Estonia, Lesotho, Nigeria, Vietnam and others. The paper provides theory for how perceptions of masculinity and femininity are socialized largely in terms of private and public space. Differences between cultures, as seen in visual commercial communications, are eclipsed by the dichotomy. Results provide evidence for how stereotypes may be emphasized in advertisements - the industry is based in the west and stereotyping may serve a purpose in the global economy. Although other studies have shown similar findings, the review suggests that advertising visuals may influence perceptions of masculinity and femininity within nations over time."
2006-0608,"Gender, Power, and Communities of Practice in Televised Panel Interviews","Language and Social Interaction on TV: Stereotyping, Framing, and Leading",Language & Social Interaction,,,Extended Abstract,"Gender, Power, and Communities of Practice in Televised Panel Interviews","Language and Social Interaction on TV: Stereotyping, Framing, and Leading","In the past decades, women have gradually established a strong presence in the political and socio-economic leadership in Dutch society, but they are still underrepresented at the highest levels. This study investigates if and how gendered interactional strategies in public debates may be contributing to the continuing difficulties women experience in entering and succeeding in the highest ranks of the countrys leadership.

The data for this project are four panel interviews in the interview and discussion program Buitenhof on Dutch public television involving 6 male and 7 female speakers and totally 1h 30 min of talk. The main focus of the analysis is the occurrence of overlaps, continuers, assessments, and various kinds of interruptions as defined by Roger, Bull & Smith (1988). Overlaps and backchannels project participation and engagement, while interruptions can be seen as (successful or unsuccessful) strategies for conversational dominance.

In the mixed panels, we find the women producing more overlaps, slightly more assessments and considerable more unsuccessful interruptions than men, while the men have more continuers and a larger number of successful interruptions. The all-female panel shows higher rates of overlaps and backchannels and a high success rate of interruptions (89% as opposed to 70% for the men and 50% for the women in the mixed panels).

The gender differences are much more pronounced for experts than for politicians, suggesting that gender may be much less relevant in the parliamentary discourse community, while business and governmental institutions are still employing markedly gendered practices."

Generational distribution of each lifestyle group was described and compared to each other. A factor analysis of motivation in mobile phone uses resulted in five significant motives compared to those of conventional mass media. Lastly, a multiple analysis of variances was run to identify differences in motives and usages among three generations and lifestyle groups. Generation and lifestyle factors, as social and cultural variables, appeared to have meaningful, but modest effects on mobile phone usages. The implication of generational and lifestyle differences in media behaviors were discussed in terms of a potential drive for a future societal change."

The objectives of this study are to assess the effects of two types of information in news stories about genetics: deterministic and probabilistic frames and efficacy information. The context is genetic susceptibility to smoking addiction and efficacy to assist during quitting attempts. Outcomes include inference of genetic susceptibility to addiction, personal efficacy to quit, control over smoking, and intentions to quit. Subjects were 201 young adult smokers recruited in a national random-digit-dialing sample. They were surveyed on the telephone in a randomized experiment embedded in a survey about cigarette smoking practices. In the framing condition, respondents heard either deterministic or probabilistic frames for genetic influence. Crossed with these is an efficacy or no-efficacy condition. Framing and efficacy interacted in their impact on inference of genetic susceptibility such that the no efficacy condition is associated with stronger inferences in the deterministic frame. The inference of genetic susceptibility mediates personal efficacy, control over smoking which in turn are associated with the intention to quit."

To locate hotspots of social capital, we calculate a local indicator of spatial autocorrelation. Higher intensities of social capital are found in the Northeast and the Breadbasket states of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, and the Dakotas. Lower intensities of social capital are found in the South and de-industrialized Midwest. A thin diagonal band of counties, extending from southern Michigan to west Texas cleaves regional clusters of High-High (HH) and Low-Low (LL) social capital. Variation in social capital across the U.S. is linked to variations in media activity such as television, newspaper, and internet use that enhance and erode rates of local civic engagement, adjusting for critical socioeconomic variables."
2006-0612,"Global Entertainment and the Roma ""Underclass""",tercultural Contact Zones and Post-Colonial Communication Studies,Ethnicity and Race in Communication,,,Paper,"Global Entertainment and the Roma ""Underclass""",Intercultural Contact Zones and Post-Colonial Communication Studies,"The paper acknowledges the importance of the pan-European attention that has been paid to the European Roma problem at various scales and in various discourses recently, from European Union policy-making to local grassroots activism to social scientific studies. However, it argues that policy-oriented activism and most social scientific research offer an oversimplified view of the Romas situation in post-communist Europe by continuing to ground Romany identities in victimization and by ignoring the ways in which global entertainment media and transnational networking have transformed ethnic relations in Eastern Europe in the last fifteen years. The essay considers new representations that revalorize traditionally ludic, entertaining Roma images, analyzing in some detail the recent Hungarian animated film, The District (2004), which features cool Roma characters from the urban ghetto, the space of exclusion from the nation, as representatives of an emerging national, ethnic-class solidarity against both corrupt neocolonial governments and global corporate capitalism."
2006-0613,Global Governance Networks and the European Union: A Co-Evolutionary Theory Perspective,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,Political Communication,,,Paper,Global Governance Networks and the European Union: A Co-Evolutionary Theory Perspective,Political Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Globalization seems to be omnipresent. Volumes have been written about it over the past few years, as scholars from many disciplines have attempted to define and account for the phenomena and processes the term describes. Most research on globalization, however, is largely a-theoretical; and even when there is an attempt to part with pure empiricism, the result is a theory on globalization, not a theory of globalization. In this paper, I argue for an evolutionary theoretical framework, which would allow for much needed theory-driven empirical analysis of global transformations. Aspects of the European Union project are used to illustrate how evolutionary theory captures change in the making. The paper concludes with a critique of this approach and outlines a research agenda that would lead to further development and resolution of current limitations."

The emergence of media policies including censorship in Ghana showed that television has transitioned from the role of development to that of reflecting the global and local phenomena.

The qualitative content analysis approach was employed to analyze the contents of television program guides and the results were related to the issues of development, dependency, globalization, and localization. The media policies in Ghana and the language of transmission were also discussed.

The findings showed more local than global programs on GTV during the period under study. In contrast, there were more global than local programs on TV3, Metro TV, and Crystal TV. Most of the global programs in the categories of news, sports, sit-com, soap/drama, and action/adventure, were from the USA though others came from Europe, Asia, and other African nations. Also, media policies exist, by ways of an act of the constitution of Ghana in 1992 and broadcasting standards responding to globalization.

Globalization has a wide scope with dimensions of culture, and communication including the media in Ghana. The quest to maintain national identity through media policies coupled with the selection of specific foreign programs, in the face of globalization, yield evidence of complex interactions."

The free-flow of information has accompanied that of capital across borders and within that flow of information comes the flow of ideas and values. While information has become a commodity and individuals are conducting business internationally, rather than leaving it to large-scale corporations, many organizations still heed social and political issues. With the influence of globalization in the everyday lives of individuals, greater numbers of feminist and globalization researchers are focusing on the global impact of feminism. What does feminism mean in the global community and where is it having an impact? An important step to take in an effort to understand globalization and feminism in the modern world is that of understanding where women fit into the framework of globalization. This study sought to examine the role that modern research is taking in constructing global values for local feminist movements. Through examining the content and structure of various research texts on globalization and feminism, this study found that the trend in research, whether intentional or not, is to apply Westernized ideals of womens rights when examining feminist movements across cultures. Frequently, this is manifested in transnational advocacy programs, wherein a standard is applied for what may be expected of the movement to appear successful in comparison with the rest of the world."

The paper is concerned with corporate and business-unit strategy. It uses the work of Michael Porter to categorise the strategies employed by the largest international media corporations. It finds that, with the exception of News Corporation, none of the companies has made a sufficient commitment to be judged to have developed a full-blown corporate strategy. All the others remain in the pre-entry stage. This finding, together with the continuing influence of the Chinese state and the largest national media corporations, suggest that the situation in the media remains very fluid. The major contenders both national and international are briefly reviewed and their current business unit strategies assessed. On the basis of this analysis, a number of possible scenarios for the future of the culture industry in China are considered."

The secretary was seen as indifferent to the troops on the ground, ignoring officers advice, misjudging troop strength, and offering a false explanation when asked by troops why personnel carriers had not been outfitted with protective armor. Amid the controversy, reports surfaced that Rumsfeld had used an autopen to sign the condolence letters sent to families of dead soldiers. More than anything else, this revelation stepped up calls for the secretarys resignation. What seemed to matter most was that Rumsfeld meant wellhis sincerity was impeccable as far as Bush was concerned. The result, however, was to make Rumsfelds performance and command of the facts marginal to the discussion; the quality of his intentions and the character of his soul were, according to the Commander-in-Chief, the most important criteria by which to judge the performance of the Secretary of Defense during wartime."
2006-0618,Going Against the Grain: When and Why Public Relations Professionals Engage in Dissent,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,Public Relations,,,Paper,Going Against the Grain: When and Why Public Relations Professionals Engage in Dissent,Public Relations Interactive Paper Session,"A survey of 808 public relations practitioners measured when and how public relations practitioners would dissent with organizational decisions they viewed as inappropriate. More than one third would always dissent in the face of an insane, illegal, or immoral decision. Most would assertively confront management in the face of an immoral decision. Agitating others or using facts selectively are somewhat acceptable. Sabotage and leaking information are the least acceptable behaviors when dealing with an immoral decision. Extreme tactics to rebuff illegal decisions are more acceptable than employing similar tactics in response to immoral/unethical or inefficient/impractical decisions. It is acceptable to agitate others to help or use facts selectively to make a case when the situation is illegal or immoral. Respondents said it was unacceptable to dissent through leaking information or sabotage when a decision is simply inefficient or impractical. Theoretical and practical applications are addressed."

Traditional international news extramedia factors were found to influence story topics and some aspects of narratives. However, the detailed qualitative data about news narratives and visual communication suggested that television reporter and photographer conventions influenced content. Visual measures included portrayals of persons and objects, paraproxemics, lighting, camera angle, shot distance, composition, and graphic elements. Contributing to Mexican stereotypes or incomplete portrayals of President Fox were reliance on file footage, lack of creativity in illustrating policy concepts, and the story package structure in television news. While television displayed innovation in graphics in the small sample, it fell short on employing innovation to create higher quality news content."

Which conclusions have we to draw from the thesis of the impotence of the State-Nation face to the omnipotent of ICT? Within the framework of our research on the changes of infrastructures of the public space, we have followed the negotiation and the institutional process within the French State to respond to this crisis. In the framework of this you study, we are focus on a recent institutional innovation which challenges the concept of governance in France: The Forum des Droits sur Internet (FDI). Between Public policies studies and Pragmatics communication theories, we were enabled to reveal how the ""Forum"" engages a new model of governance, with pragmatic dimension, within the meaning of Austin and Habermas, resting entirely on information and communication processes. The FDI would be defined as an institution of treatment of the knowledge and standard in the order of Law. The communication and the power becoming two concepts deeply intermingled in the stakes of institutionalized procedures, we will try to show how the configuration of a libertarian self-regulation gradually makes place with a new model of regulation which transforms the nature of the traditional kingly State, while being based on a new ""software power"" which calls upon relations of communication."

Channels changing, also called channel surfing or grazing, is one of the largest obstacles that television programmers have to overcome to entice and hold audiences. A rigorous mathematical model can help to untangle this complex phenomenon and its underlying processes. This paper investigates and develops a model of the relationships among program format features, viewer age, and channel changing behavior during television viewing. A conceptual framework for understanding channel changing behavior was previously developed by Lang (see Lang, Shin, Bradley, Wang, Lee, & Potter, 2005; Fox, Park, Grabe, & Lee, 2005). We have mathematically formalized this conceptual framework in terms of a semi Markov choice model of channel changing behavior, and we rigorously tested it using empirical data. This mathematical model helps to test and develop theories about channel changing behavior, and also demonstrates the power of modeling in media psychology theory building."
2006-0623,Group Effectiveness: An Integral and Developmental Perspective,Understanding Work Groups through Multilevel Analysis,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Group Effectiveness: An Integral and Developmental Perspective,Understanding Work Groups through Multilevel Analysis,"Utilizing Ken Wilbers theory of integral psychology, this paper critiques the limitations of existing works on group effectiveness and presents a developmental model of group and group effectiveness. While many works have been done to understand group effectiveness and to construct conceptual models explaining the antecedents of group effectiveness, current literature is flawed in that most of them only examine the lower levels of group effectives and external determinants of group effectiveness without paying attention to the developmental dimensions of group effectiveness. To address this problem, this present paper proposes an integral and developmental model of group effectiveness, emphasizing both performance and developmental variables on the individual, group, and organizational level. Furthermore, this paper also explains the determinants of group effectiveness in terms of not only the external individual behavior and social factors but also the internal aspects of individuals, organization, and society."

Of interest was the distinction between identification and active involvement in partisan groups, and whether this distinction moderated the effects of perceived news slant and personal opinion on estimated public opinion regarding the issues studied. As predicted, members of county Democratic and Republican Central Committees held more extreme attitudes and opinions than did those who merely identified with the two parties. Perceptions of hostile news bias were accentuated among Democratic and Republican committee members, while identifiers perceptions of article slant tended to be more moderate. The perceived slant of news articles proved to be a strong predictor of Democratic and Republican Party identifiers' public opinion estimates. Among Democratic and Republican committee members, however, exposure to contrary news content appeared to accentuate beliefs that the public held similar views. Contrary to past assumptions, the personal views of Democratic and Republican identifiers and even Republican committee members were somewhat influenced by exposure to specific news articles. However, Democratic committee members remained firm in their beliefs regarding Kyoto treaty ratification and ANWR oil drilling. These and other findings largely supported the need to distinguish between group identification and active involvement in formal groups when trying to predict partisan perceptions of news coverage and public opinion."

The study was based on a model of group socialization developed by Moreland and Levine (1982) and modified in this study for highly interdependent workgroups of municipal firefighters. Utilizing hierarchical linear modeling we examined individual- and crew-level influence on four assimilation outcomes: involvement, trust, commitment, and acceptance. At the individual-level, acculturation predicted all four assimilation outcomes. Involvement also was a predictor of the latter sequences of assimilation: commitment and acceptance. We also found that one crew-level variablecrew performanceaffected, and modified the influence of tenure, proactivity, involvement, acculturation, and trust on members commitment. We offer implications for the influence of group interaction on member assimilation and support for continuing group-level research on assimilation. This study demonstrates the utility of multilevel analyses in examining communication at the interpersonal and group levels."

Through what he calls hauntology, Derrida examines the spectral or ghostal effects inherent in any sensorial experience or interaction and shows that what appears as present during an observation or an interaction is also always already contaminated by what is absent, a phenomenon which could be associated with the general functioning of the sign and its iterability. These spectral effects are also problematized through his concept of restance, i.e. the staying capacity of (oral or written) text, a capacity that, as I will show, participates in the presence/absence game. Although ethnomethodologists share, in many respects, several common points with Derridas position, I will show that they tend to neglect these spectral effects and remain prisoners of a metaphysics of presence. As Derrida (1988) notes in his famous comment on Austins (1962/1975) work, any communication is, in a way, a form of telecommunication, an idea whose ethnomethodological implications still need to be adequately identified."

However, scholarship in health communication has yet to address the sociohistorical context of how and why this concept called communication became central to health and medicine in the first place. For as much as communication is taken for granted today as the cornerstone of quality health care for Americans, this was not the case even forty years ago when doctors authority went unquestioned. At a time when calls are increasing for health communication scholarship to focus more on the social context of medicine and health, the idea of communication ought to be interrogated from outside the taken-for-granted assumptions of the field. This paper takes this approach as it examines how communication is conceptualized in the field of health communication, specifically, in the area of doctor-patient communication. I make the case that health communication is dominated by the information model of communication and this colors what the field considers good communication should be between patient and physician within the context of medicine becoming more consumer or patient-centered and focused on informed decisionmaking."

Assessments of the populations ability to read and comprehend written materials are complex and highly salient in multilingual countries, such as Zambia, particularly when an ex-colonial language is but one of multiple official languages. Yet no study has contrasted adult Zambians reading comprehension of health materials in the major Zambian languages with comparable English-language materials. This article reports the results of a survey of 2009 literate Zambian adults who were tested for reading comprehension of health materials written at fourth- and eighth-grade levels. The analysis found that respondents who had not gone beyond primary school scored significantly higher on Zambian- than on English-language reading comprehension tests. Respondents with at least an eighth-grade education scored equally well or better on English- compared with Zambian-language tests. Overall, respondents were more likely to pass the grade-four than the grade-eight reading comprehension tests. In the multilingual context of Zambia it is vital to produce health communication print materials written at or near a grade-four readability level in English and, when warranted, in appropriate Zambian languages."

This study examined credibility and homophily as two underlying mechanisms for social influence with regard to online health information. Employing a 2 (website vs. discussion group presentation) x 2 (didactic vs. narrative style) x 2 (instrumental vs. coping advice) between-subjects factorial design, we found that homophily grounds the credibility perception and drives the persuasive process in both web sites and online discussion groups. Additionally, the more positively the online health information stimuli were evaluated as being, the more likely people were to adopt the advice offered in that particular piece of information."

Fear appeal was chosen as a message content element and the dynamic vs. the static way of presentation was a message form in this study. Both content and message form had a significant effect on recognition memory. We also found a significant interaction effect of content by form on choice of anti-smoking PSAs for friends who want to quit smoking. Participants selected high fear anti-smoking PSAs in the dynamic format significantly more often than the static format, whereas they tended to choose low fear anti-smoking PSAs more often in a static format. Our findings suggest that how to combine message content and form will help health message designers develop more persuasive public health messages."

Negative, positive, and curvilinear relationship had been reported. In an attempt to detangle this problem, this study explored the relationship between overall television viewing and life satisfaction among college students, as well as the effects of exposure to the depiction of health risks in television medical dramas on viewers perceived health risks and life satisfaction. Health involvement was also included to see if it affects the relationship of television medical drama exposure to perceived health risks and life satisfaction. Results showed that overall television viewing was negatively associated with life satisfaction, and exposure to TV medical dramas tended to lower viewers life satisfaction, and health consciousness was important for understanding life satisfaction. Exposure to televised portrayals of health risks in television medical dramas tended to produce different results between viewers perceptions of health risks to themselves and to general others."

The paper engages existing debates regarding representational and constitutive views of communication, problematizes the humanistic premises and dichotomous logics of both views, and offers an alternative approach grounded in Heideggers ontology and his critique of modern technology. The U. S. Department of Energys Hanford nuclear reservation serves as an illustrative text, exemplifying Heideggers reading of nuclear energy as a culmination of both Western metaphysics and the instrumental stance that he calls enframing. In Heideggers view, the ordering and control accomplished through enframing diminishes the possibilities for human existence as well as for relationships between humans and nature."

In short, risk has migrated from being an operative concept to increasingly being a thematic concept. Furthermore, risk is ascribed different meanings in the various contexts, and, as this paper argues, these meanings transcend the contexts complicating modern organizations efforts to meet an increasing demand for dealing with and communicating about risk."
2006-0634,High Scores: How Violence and Frustration in Video Games Affect Aggression,Game Studies Top Papers,Game Studies,,,Paper,High Scores: How Violence and Frustration in Video Games Affect Aggression,Game Studies Top Papers,"As both the popularity of video games and the reporting of teenage violent acts increase, much has been said regarding the ability of violent video games to influence aggression in their players. Yet, other factors in video games which may contribute to aggressive players have not been heavily discussed in the media or in academia. Using the General Aggression Model (GAM), a 2 X 2 factorial design was conducted with 150 male college undergraduates playing different video games to investigate the impact of 1) the violent content in video games and 2) frustration with playing the game on later measurements of aggressive affect and physiological arousal. Results showed that neither violent content nor frustration affected heart rate. Violent content did not affect blood pressure although frustration increased blood pressure. Individually, both violent content and frustration did increase scores on a scale designed to measure feelings of anger. The combination of violent content and frustration led to the highest scores on the anger instrument. Findings support the GAM and suggest that frustration with gameplay could be just as an effective means, if not more so, of influencing aggression within game players as exposure to violent content."

My name is Clora"": The Effects of Self-Disclosing Agents on the Attitude and Behavior of Users",Online Self-Disclosure,"The current study examines the effects of intimacy and amount of self-disclosure of a computer agent on the users' disclosure behaviors and positive attitudes toward the agent. Participants exchanged self-disclosure messages with a computer agent. The experiment was conducted in a 2(intimacy of agent's disclosure: high vs. low) by 2(amount of agent's disclosure: high vs. low) between-group design. The results show that: 1) disclosure reciprocity was found in both sub dimensions (intimacy and amount) of self-disclosure; 2) agent's high intimacy self-disclosure correlated with low social attraction, trustworthiness and expectation of mutual influence toward agent, suggesting that the highly intimate disclosure in initial stage in a relationship was regarded as inappropriate in human-agent interaction, similar to findings in human relationship; 3) the amount of agents self-disclosure had no significant effect on the social attraction, trustworthiness and expectation of mutual influence toward the agent. Theoretical and practical (agent design) implications are discussed."

A discourse and social semiotic analysis of the two films, Roja and Sarfarosh, revealed three key themes  the centrality of home and duty, the link between an individual males biography and the nations narrative, and the nation and religions role in defining male identity  which suggest that a certain form of masculinity had acquired hegemonic status in India in the 1990s. Even as Hindu nationalism defines India as a Hindu nation, neatly collapsing the terms Indian and Hindu and describes Islam as alien to the Indian nation, I argue that the forms of masculinity that became hegemonic during this period accorded primacy to patriotism, duty and virility and marginalized all other forms of masculinity not linked to nationalism and the nation in specific ways, including that of the Muslim male by delegetimizing them."

Homophily of network ties were examined in terms of both demographic and social characteristics, including gender, race, geographic location and group assignment. Social network data were collected from 32 students enrolled in a distance learning class from two universities. MQAP regression analysis showed that homophily in gender and in race had no significant impact on the development of either instrumental or expressive ties. In instrumental networks, both homophily in group assignment and in location had significant impact on the development of network ties. In expressive networks, homophily in location still had significant impact on the development of network ties, but the impact of homophily in group membership was only close to significant (p = .06). Further analysis on bonding ties with people of the same group and bridging ties with people from different groups showed that bonding social capital could exert significant influence on performance."

The principal objective is to operationalize the concept of mediated visibility (Thompson 1995, 2000) by examining a clear-cut case of political scandal, and by focusing on how the varying power relations between media, politicians and citizens are represented in visual and verbal media discourse. The politician in focus is Jan O Karlsson, Swedish social democratic minister of migration and foreign aid during the years 2001-2003. The Karlsson affair was defined and remembered through the catching phrase dooing a whole poodle, implying that he was forced to roll over and humiliate himself in front of the fourth estate. It is of principal interest because it explicitly thematizes the power relations between media, politics and citizens. The analyses have been carried out within the general framework of discourse analysis, centering on actors, power relations, statements and modes of address in verbal and visual representations. Following Tomlinson´s (1999) argument that media scandals are highly context-dependent, we argue that the political scandal in case must be understood within the framework of a deeply rooted Swedish political culture, with strong emphasis on egalitarian, collective and puritan values. If ""scandal theorists mainly have looked at the importance of media to political scandal, we turn the perspective around and consider the importance of political scandal to the media themselves."

On the one hand, children are seen as active and literate media users; on the other hand, they are addressed as consumers of globalised cross-media products. Up to now little attention has been paid to the role of media within the lives of children in particularly challenging social conditions. The paper at hand highlights how children from this group deal with cross-mediated products and how they define these products as their personal media brands. The findings show that their favourite media brand  in this case the anime series Dragonball Z  provides orientation and assistance. In adopting the perspectives of their heroes they gain the kind of attention and appreciation, they are missing in real-life social relationships. The paper presents results of an in-depth-analysis, which is based on a study concerned with Media brands in childrens everyday lives (## 2004)."

Hall and Klaus Krippendorff. Hall's notion of High- and Low-Context-Cultures (1976) provides a communication-oriented view of culture, and Krippendorff (1986) presents a framework to understand interferences in communication. Based on both works a new model which illustrates potential interferences on the process of intercultural communication is generated. This new model offers a systematic approach on how misunderstandings between High- and Low-Context-Cultures emerge. Combining the basic ideas of Hall and Krippendorff six archetypes of interpersonal communication are developed: The model differentiates between two intracultural and four intercultural communication archetypes that can be identified by the interferences occurred in the communication process."

And how have these differences changed since the late 60s? While a few scholars of communication and linguistics have analyzed the difference between TV news shows from different countries at a given moment, diachronic comparative analysis has hardly been done  although the question of Americanization of European TV news or the development of a global media culture is often discussed. In this paper, American and Swiss TV news from 1968 to 1999 will be compared, focusing on the form of news reporting  the forms which create meaning on a subtle level. The comparison points at important cultural differences in news reporting in the ways actuality, closeness and authenticity are staged and in the forms of news narratives, but it also points out a decrease of these differences. Different explanations, like commercialization, technical development, journalistic culture and cultural differences in communication practices are discussed."

Looking at the Three Dimensions of Emotion Through a Gendered Lens,Feminist Scholarship Interactive Paper Session,"Emotional responses to mediated messages are inevitable. The magnitude of such responses is dependent on the individual as well as the content of the message.

By following the framework laid out here, this project hopes to demonstrate that dominance can be nearly as significant a dimension of emotion as valence and arousal, when working with the theory of three-dimensions of emotion; dominances impact on an individuals emotional state can actually be dependent on the nature and the content of the stimuli."

Where do these part-time workers fit into Jablins (1987, 2001) model of organizational entry, assimilation, and disengagement/exit? Four major themes are discussed. First, the organizational socialization process assumes the existence of organizational boundaries that demarcate outsiders, newcomers, and insiders. Second, both individuals and organizations have interactive influence on each other. Third, the model is drawn as a linear form of development. And fourth, the assimilation process is described in terms of full-time employment and excludes nonstandard work arrangements. Particular areas of Jablins (1987, 2001) assimilation model are critiqued in terms of its application to part time workers."

This study is a first empirical test of three causal linkages implied by their appraisal-based comforting model. An experiment was conducted to examine a sequential mediation model that predicted that person-centered and nonverbally immediate emotional support causes verbalizations of thoughts and feelings. These kinds of verbalizations cause cognitive reappraisals, which in turn were predicted to cause affective improvement. A total of 258 participants talked about an emotionally upsetting event to a confederate trained to display low, moderate, or high levels of person centeredness and nonverbal immediacy. After the interaction, participants completed several scales. Data were analyzed with regression and path-analytic procedures, and showed that the relationship between the two message factors and affective improvement was partially mediated by verbalizations of positive emotion words and reappraisals."

In this study we examined the degree to which college students in Singapore misconceive their peers sexual attitudes and behavior. The data for this paper came from a web-based survey involving a random sample of 534 college students in Singapore. The results indicate a widespread evidence of pluralistic ignorance; that is, students believed that their peers were significantly more sexually active than was actually the case. The data also suggested that students formed such erroneous impressions of peers based in part on their exposure to sex-related media and on their own sexual attitudes."

We examined the communication boundaries between the married son and his mother, the interpersonal solidarity of the relationship between the daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law, and the couples marital satisfaction. A survey of 35 marital dyads revealed a positive association between the husbands verbally communicated boundary with his mother and his perception of his mothers intrusiveness. Analyses further revealed a negative association between the sons perception of his mothers intrusiveness and his wifes marital satisfaction."

Personalization of exhibitions is one way to achieve this end. There are various options for personalization using information systems. A major question is how directive personalization should be. This paper reports on two explorative studies into methods for personalizing digital content presentation in museum exhibitions. Visitor preference for and acceptance of 1) profiling methods, varying as to context sensitivity and 2) presentation methods, varying as to the amount of guidance imposed on visitors by the presentation, were tested using a simulated exhibition.The main findings are that visitor satisfaction with context sensitive, stepwise profiling was higher than with immediate, abstract profiling; that independent exploration was preferred to directive guidance; that visitor variables had only minor influences throughout on satisfaction with both profiling and guidance methods. Implications may be that using context-sensitive interaction resulting in suggestions to the visitor is a much more successful option than sign-in forms and the like opaque methods instantly returning a profile. In closing we recommend a continuous and adaptive form of profiling during the entire visit, enabling a flexible form of presentation varying as to the degree of guidance."

In addition, it examines how motivational system activation, as an individual difference, modifies how people attend to risky and non risky products. The results show that risky products activate the appetitive motivational system and that this is particularly true for individuals with a highly active appetitive system (i.e. those with high positivity offset). The results further suggest that for those with a highly active aversive system (that is those with high negativity bias) there is some weak activation of the aversive system when viewing risky products. In addition, as was seen in previous research, risky products elicited more arousal (both self-reported and physiological) and were remembered better than non risky products. Finally, results also showed that those high in either positivity offset or negativity bias paid much more attention (indicated by heart rate) to risky compared to non risky products."

These 12 characters were selected through pretesting the humanlikeness level and controlling attractiveness rating. A control condition without an image was included. Social responses were assessed with the participants' ratings of social presence and homophily with the agents and social influence of the agents in social choice-dilemma scenarios. Linear polynomial analysis revealed significant linear trend for all measures, supporting the hypothesis. As the agent became more anthropomorphic to being human, it was rated with higher social presence and higher homophily and was more persuasive in social influence. The control condition without an image showed responses most similar to those in the human image condition, suggesting the notion of the default image in interactive text-based computer interfaces."

The differences in the coverage of two religious groups were studied. The New York Times was chosen for the study and a content analysis was done. The analysis examined framing of two religious groups--Hindus and Muslims--in 130 stories about the partition and independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. The analysis looked for three frames--attention, prominence and treatment. The study found that while Hindus were placed in the frame of prominence, Muslims were placed in the attention frame. Finally, the study found that both groups figured in the treatment frame-Hindus dominated the number of partisan assertions, and the Muslim groups problems and policies were highlighted.

Although the third-person effect on people's opinions have primarily been studied in political, mass communication and advertising settings , the central idea of the third person effect  formulation of the public opinion  fits the context of business communication, as well. This research explored the third-person effects in the context of business communication, particularly in corporate crisis situations. It also tested the impact of reputation on the third person effects. This study proposed hypotheses and implemented an experiment to test the hypothesized relationships."
2006-0669,"How to Evaluate It: Affective Agenda Setting, Affective Priming, Media Framing and Electoral Behavior",New Perspectives on Priming and Framing,Political Communication,,,Paper,"How to Evaluate It: Affective Agenda Setting, Affective Priming, Media Framing and Electoral Behavior",New Perspectives on Priming and Framing,"This study presents several arguments. First, the publics evaluation of issue importance, which is the dependent variable in most agenda setting studies, is influenced by issue saliency in the news as well as by the evaluative tone of media coverage (positive, negative or neutral). This evaluative tone or affective attribute attached to the issue is part of the second-level of agenda setting. Second, these affective attributes that people attach to issues further play an important role in the process of priming. The priming effect itself is stretched here to include voting behavior instead of performance evaluations. Third, it is argued that the electoral behavior of voters is simultaneously influenced by media framing, and especially by media attribution of responsibility. Consequently, these arguments point to the mutual behavioral impacts of agenda setting (at the firs and second levels), and priming and framing in the electoral process. All arguments are supported by empirical analyses. The controversy between second-level agenda setting and framing is also discussed, although it is not resolved."

Robot characters provide a unique comparison for studying attitudes towards and preference of human races. An experiment with 105 White participants assessed the participants implicit and explicit racial prejudice towards the Blacks, their interest in robots, and their ordered preference among 15 White, Black and robot computer-generated characters for five different purposes. The explicit racial prejudice predicted more liking of White characters than Black ones and more preference of White to Black characters as ones avatar, virtual friend, and virtual tutor. The implicit racial prejudice, measured with the Implicit Association Test (IAT), provided further predictive utility for choosing avatar and virtual friend among participants who took less time in character selection. Interest in robots and racial prejudice predicted the preference of robots to White or Black characters for some tasks. Among the 65 participants (61.9%) who reported no interest in robots, racial prejudice negatively predicted the preference of Black to robot characters in liking and as virtual friend and tutor, showing a pattern that White individuals with high explicit racial prejudice progressively preferred robot characters to Black ones. Although the results suggest alarming strength of high racial prejudice, drawing implications about real humans and robots is cautioned against unless future research replicates the effects with images of real humans and real robots."

However, to date, studies on transnational media organizations have tended to only cluster around strategic issues and market entry strategies, leaving functional questions such as cross-cultural personnel management, leadership, and other human resource (HR) issues insufficiently addressed.

Nevertheless, the media industries represent a subset of knowledge-intensive and people-intensive industries. People are the key of success. The efficient operation of a media company is highly dependent on knowledge and experience possessed by its personnel, and cooperation between people within the organization. Managing human resource to enable success is vital important. For transnational media corporations, people are even a critical component for the successful implementation and attainment of its global expansion strategies. The global competition, to a great extent, is the competition of human resource.

This paper aims at studying the HR issues in managing the transnational media corporations (TNMCs). HR management in the transnational context is characterized by contradictions that include a duality of being both locally and globally oriented. The duality, which is the tension created by opposite forces, is the heart notion of the transnational management. Applying the Bertelsmann and the Sony cases, this paper examines the HR issues for the TNMCs to experience the two forces of the duality: local responsiveness and global integration. The paper also discusses the HR implications in steering the tension arising from the duality. An agenda for the next step of study is set in the final part of the paper."

One theorized reason for this is that the sexualized portrayal of female game characters may dissuade women from wanting to engage with them. This sexualized portrayal consists of over-exaggeration of a female character's breasts while the waist is overly narrow, a costume of tight-fighting and cleavage-revealing uniforms, and even engaging in overtly sexual behavior. At the same time, it is believed this portrayal will increase a man's desire to engage with the game. These assumptions were tested as part of a larger study. In a 2x3 between-subject design of participant gender by avatar body shape, this experiment investigated how men and women perceive and react to female avatars that embody the hypersexualism body shape of big breasts, thin waist, and long, thin limbs. One-hundred and twenty men and women from a Midwestern university participated in the study. Participants were asked to describe a character after being presented an image of the avatar, and, after playing a computer game, were measured to gauge their levels of engagement with the game. Contrary to industry and academic contentions, it was found that men indicated more engagement with the game when playing as a voluptuous character while women indicated more engagement playing as the hypersexualized character. Implications for how women react to sexualized portrayals and men's preferences for digital game characters were discussed in terms of cultivation and social learning theories."

The author suggests that the types of behavior enabled and encouraged by these games actually reinforces existing cultural norms. Most cultures establish norms, and also provide occasional opportunities for transgression of these norms. Breaking the rules, and understanding that rules are being broken is necessary to test the limits and the boundaries of acceptable behavior. Games provide us with an arena in which such trangressions can take place safely. Current videogames, however, provide this transgressive opportunity primarily for white males. The author suggests it would be interesting to see what happens if these opportunities were broadened."

The analysis is based on interviews with 33 Polish immigrants. The findings demonstrate that Polish immigrants negotiated their identity through narratives of whiteness told in South Africa, inflecting them with their own experiences of immigration. Although they defended their whiteness in more or less resistant ways since the end of Apartheid, they did not reflect on it critically, tending rather to escape into the security of Polish racial homogeneity. However, some participants began to reflect critically on the position of Polishness in the South African context."

We investigate previous speculations that romantic idealization may be a key component in LDDR stability. In study one, we found idealization, as assessed by indices of idealistic distortion, romantic love, relational reminiscence, perceived agreement, and satisfaction with communication, to be more pronounced in LDDRs than geographically close relationships (GCDRs). We also found idealization to be associated with infrequent face-to-face communication. Based on a six-month longitudinal analysis (study two), LDDRs were found to be more stable than GCDRs as long as LDDR partners remained separated. However, if LDDR partners transitioned to proximity (i.e., moved to same location) during our investigation they were prone to relational dissolution. Finally, results revealed that extreme levels of idealization as well as more days in between face-to-face contact per month during geographic separation predicted relational instability upon reunion. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings for LDDR research are discussed."

The Relationship Between Medium Use and Credibility",Credibility: Advances in Research,Mass Communication,,,Paper,"If Internet Credibility Is So Iffy, Then Why the Heavy Use? The Relationship Between Medium Use and Credibility",Credibility: Advances in Research,"Just because we use the internet extensively, does it mean we think it is very credible? A large mail survey (N = 1089) was conducted to address this question by assessing whether overall internet use impacts perceived credibility, and, more importantly, how this outcome is predicted by differential utilities of the internet medium (i.e. internet use for information versus entertainment purposes), as compared to the use and utility of the print medium. Results indicate that internet credibility is significantly predicted by internet use for information, as well as by newspaper use, but not by internet use for entertainment. Two theoretical mediators for these relationships, self-efficacy and supplemental role, are highlighted and discussed."

The study examined stories and commentaries from major newspapers, major broadcast networks, and an on line womens news source. The research , which was part of a larger international study that included Canada, France, other European and African nations, was coordinated by French researchers. The study found that most mainstream media, and even some feminist media within the United States, ignored women on a day set aside specifically to shine a spotlight on the majority of the nation's and world's female population. Most media used IWD as a peg for cultural reviews and for reporting tidbits about news relating to women such as bare-breasted protesters. There simply wasnt any one or series of events associated with IWD that reached the level of crowding out whatever else needed to be covered that day, at least in the minds of American editors, with the exception of the editors at El Tiempo Latino. IWD was a symbol in the way that a historical anniversary stands as a cultural symbol, and symbols are difficult to wrest into agenda-setting roles. International Women's Day was not news in America on March 8, 2005, and the masculine-dominated public sphere was therefore not infused with women's voices through the news on that day any more than on other days."

First, I aim to explore a particular instance of a self-avowed, overdetermined performance of the black geek in the work of the artist Fatlip. Second, I examine the links between music technology and black identity through an analysis of the black producer whose relationship to complex musical technologies is often masked, elided or reconfigured under broader assumptions of either black technophobia or an anti-intellectual hypermasculinity. Here the thug-nerd indicates the degree to which black technological identity is structured not through references to normative white or Asian constructions of the techno-geek, but rather re-presents a long alternative history of black engagements with technology."

The artists answer to our questions and tell us a few things about contemporary art and creation, as well as the social status of the artist in their countries. They filled in questionnaires and were interviewed on many aspects of contemporary Balkan and Eastern European art, while they were creating their artworks in the framework of the symposiums theme (and part of a poem by Odysseas Elytis): Exiled Poet, in Your Century, Tell Us, What Do You See?"

For the purpose of this study, hate speech was defined as an expression that is abusive, insulting, intimidating, harassing, or which may incite to violence, hatred, or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation.
This study was based on a content analysis of 340 Web sites of individuals and groups that advocate violence against, separation from, defamation of, deception about, or hostility toward others based upon race, religion, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. The study concluded that hate symbols have a powerful effect because they have the ability to convey so much meaning, intent and significance in such a compact, immediately recognizable form."

Depictions of women and men are both addressed. A total of 288 depictions are examined using Goffmans (1979) framework for content analysis. Additional criteria taken for analysis are the setting in which men and women are depicted and the different types of magazines. Comparisons are drawn between the authors own findings and those of other authors. It is shown that certain means of emphasizing stereotypes (such as Feminine Touch) are still widely used, at least in mobile phone advertising, while others have decreased in frequency since Goffmans time (here, an example is Function Ranking)."

Images from the nations that constitute Europe are mediated through the Internet and reach out far beyond Europe.
The article considers the parallels between the illustrations of the various national portals that are created in the framework of the eEurope initiative and follows their hyper-connections, focusing on the Greek case study.
For the MINERVA project, Europes resources are important for preserving community memory, for the creation of a cultural area common to the peoples in Europe. Are the visions of Europe representative of those they portray? How are these metonymic images chosen and do they reflect the whole from which they were drawn?
The author shows how these illustrations open up specific electronic windows in order to attract the cyber-flanêurs gaze and how other aspects of the sociality of the specific place are kept out of sight.
Through direct comparison of specific examples and the analysis of some Greek thematic portals, a number of meaningful connections become evident.
The photographic illustrations are analyzed in terms of four theories:
1. Levys notion of a meta-national culture,
2. Baudrillards recycling theory
3. Foucaults theory on the societies of discourse and
4. Manuel Castells notion of timeless time."

The current investigation describes the paradoxical nature of the power structure in the romantic relationship with a depressed individual, and how the power structure limits the types of control strategies the non-depressed partner can use. Couples including one depressed individual (N=148 individuals) are interviewed and compared to a control group of non-depressed couples (N =68 individuals) with regard to perceptions of control, mental health, communication strategies, and relational cohesiveness and satisfaction. Results indicate that individuals who perceive they have limited family control and who use more direct attempts to control others also indicate attributions of greater external control within the relationship, report more frequent use of communication strategies that reinforce depression and discourage alternative emotional outlets, use more consistent sequences of negatively-valenced communication strategies, have poorer mental health, and indicate less cohesiveness within the relationship. Still, these same participants in depressed relationship report more satisfaction with more negative strategies, more limited perceptions of control, and less cohesiveness. This pattern does not hold for control group couples. Implications for control dynamics and communication strategies are discussed."
2006-0701,Immutable Mobiles and Organizational Communication Research,Reframing Organizational Metaphors,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Immutable Mobiles and Organizational Communication Research,Reframing Organizational Metaphors,"In this paper, we consider applications of the concept of immutable mobile for the study of organizational communication. The concept is defined and illustrated by three field studies, conducted in three environments supporting the development of new technology: police work, a hi-tech company and a teaching hospital. The paper examines development problems that emerge in the construction of a multidimensional network combining elements of technology, sensemaking and different communities of practice. We argue that the concept of immutable mobile provides a convincing framework of analysis for this and similar instances of organizational innovation but it also raises issues for management, and for the role that organizational communication researchers might be called on to play in a globalizing world. In our conclusion, we examine limits and possible extensions of the actor-network theory of immutable mobiles that provide greater explanatory power over a greater range of organizational phenomena."

The study sought to fill the gap in the research on teachers and HIV/AIDS which has been very limited and has typically focused on cataloguing teachers knowledge and attitudes, but without relating them directly to practice. The data were collected in Mozambique by administering surveys to a stratified sample of 606 teachers. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the data.
The study found that younger teachers, teachers who know someone who is sick/has died of HIV/AIDS, and upper primary school teachers are more likely to have talked about HIV/AIDS in the past in school and in the community, and are also more likely to do so in the future. With respect to talking about HIV/AIDS in schools specifically, the study further found that a high overall perception of personal risk and high knowledge of HIV/AIDS increases willingness to talk about the disease in school contexts. Finally, high perception of personal risk also influenced the likelihood that teachers acted as spokespersons on HIV/AIDS in communities, as did consistently use of condoms in sexual relations. . The study underscores the important role that teachers can potentially play in HIV/AIDS prevention provided that personal and contextual variables that influence teachers willingness to communicate about HIV/AIDS are taken into account in policy and practice."

News stories about the Iraq War on ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, and NBC Nightly News were selected. A total of 1,201 news paragraphs were drawn for content analysis. Public opinion polls were collected for public perceptions in different news attributes about the Iraq War. Results demonstrated that news about the Iraq War was more episodic than thematic. There were more positive than negative frames the war news about Iraq. Results also found news attributes about the Iraq War similar with poll results indicating that second-level agenda setting and framing were at work. The implications of the results and suggestions for future research were discussed."

Using data collected on 3- to 5-year-old physically abused (n = 9), neglected children (n=36) and a comparison group of same-aged, low-income, non-maltreated children (n = 37), this study examined the relationship between maltreatment type, social skills and child loneliness. Results indicated that regardless of type of abuse and, in keeping with Attachment theory, maltreated children displayed fewer pro-social communicative behaviors then their non-maltreated peers, suggesting that neither group of children engage peers well. However, in a self-report of loneliness, only neglected children were significantly more lonely then control children. The findings shed light on the social and interpersonal consequences of caretaker physical abuse and neglect."
2006-0705,Implicit Memory Measures for Web Advertising Effectiveness,Advances in Advertising Research II,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Implicit Memory Measures for Web Advertising Effectiveness,Advances in Advertising Research II,"Prior advertising studies investigating memory for advertisements have heavily relied on examining effects of explicit memories (i.e., recall or recognition). However, consumers are more likely to focus on the information that is relevant to their Web-visiting objectives, and furthermore some are trying to intentionally avoid Web advertisements during their online activities, resulting in poor explicit memory performance and dismal click-through rates. The present study introduces the measure of implicit memory as an alternative to assess the effectiveness of Web advertising. The results of an experiment suggest that implicit memory would complement the shortcomings of explicit memory and click-through measures, especially in the case where consumers do not actively engage in processing Web advertising information. Implications and directions for future studies are also discussed."

This study investigate the DMTs impact on client-provider communication, quality of decision-making behaviors and medical/technical information giving in Nicaragua.

METHODS: 426 family planning clients attended by 60 service providers in Nicaragua were videotaped three months before and four month after attending a training workshop on the DMT.. The videotapes were coded afterward . In-depth interviews and focus group discussions explored clients and providers opinions on how the DMT was used helped for their communication.

RESULTS: Providers improved communication with their clients when counseling with the DMT, better engaged clients in decision making process, gave more through and tailored medical/technical information and talked more about dual protection from unwanted pregnancy and HIV/AIDS. Client also engaged more in the decision making process.

CONCLUSIONS: The DMT succeeded as both a job aid for providers and a decision aid for clients. Questions remain regarding the follow-up needed to support continuing use of the DMT and its impact on family planning outcomes."

This paper looks to provide an institutional and textual analysis of advertising images in sports news telecasts. It explores the processes by which advertisements come to appear in sports highlight programs and the forms these selling messages take. The study focuses on ESPNs SportsCenter as the pioneering and dominant program in this genre but also analyzes original sports telecasts. It finds that the processes and arrangements that structure sports highlight programs make them especially vulnerable to commercial infiltration. This springs from the predictability of the programs content and their utter dependence on a limited range of sources. The net result is that many highlights have come to resemble a rapid fire succession of advertising messages. The dynamic between these hyper-commercialized images and the programs news function may further naturalize a commodified vision of culture."

Current college-aged smokers were surveyed on the key predictive components of the theory of planned behavior and their self construals. The findings suggest the general validity of the theory of planned behavior. In support of the hypothesized model, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms were significantly related to the intention to quit smoking. However, attitude toward quitting smoking failed to significantly predict intention to quit smoking. A good fit was found for the extended theory of planned behavior model which included self construals. Interdependence was linked to subjective norms which predicted intention to quit smoking. Independence was linked to perceived behavioral control which predicted intention to quit smoking. Further research delineating the other cultural antecedents of variables identified in the theory of planned behavior is required, as well as further investigation into the potential of the extended model used in this study as a culturally sensitive framework for intervention."

In educational settings, these may impact teacher outcomes (e.g., teachers perceived satisfaction with leadership and perceptions of their own effectiveness). Questionnaires, case studies, and leader narratives help identify transformational leadership factors and measure perceived effectiveness of these factors in practice. Findings suggest transformational leadership does have strong relationships with teacher motivation and student outcomes, most often through principal leadership. Variables influencing transformational leadership include principal leadership, teachers and students perceptions, as well as school culture. Understanding how these factors influence learning environments and student outcomes creates opportunities for increasing educational organizational performance."

This study is an empirical examination of the ""cultural fit"" hypothesis, which holds that it is not the personality per se that predict the adjustment, but the fit between the personality and the new cultural background. As individual/collectivism is the most common mentioned dimension of cultural difference, this study explored the interaction of personality and environment in terms of individualism/collectivism fit. As American cultural is more individualistic, the study hypothesized that more individualistic international student would have better adjustment to life in U.S. A survey was conducted in a large Western university among international students. In data analysis, the influence of extraneous factors was controlled. Results show that language fluency, perceived cultural distance, length of stay and previous experience were not significantly related to the adjustment. Ethnocentrism plays an important and negative role in adjustment. The less tendency of ethnocentrism a person has, the better the adjustment would be reached. After controlling ethnocentrism and all other extraneous variables, the participants individualism/collectivism tendency still held a significant relationship with the adjustment. That is, even after considering the impact of ethnocentrism, the cultural fit concept adds our understanding on intercultural adjustment. This study provided empirical support to the cultural fit hypothesis which holds significant theoretical implication. Suggestions for future research were provided."

This is exemplified in the case of Argentina. This paper intends to examine historically how Argentine mediaconsidered among the regions most sophisticatedhave been affected as evidenced by changing regulatory environments, media-state relations, and media content. During periods when globalization forces allowed foreign capital to infuse media industries and new technologies to be adopted, and reduced the role of the state, Argentine media grew into vibrant and sophisticated industries. These periods of growth were abruptly shunted by periods of non-democratic political rule, when media were co-opted directly or indirectly by the state to serve political purposes, and by several periods of economic recession, when dependence upon the state for subsidies increased as private industries disappeared. Political elites continued to view the media as advocacy instruments to advance specific goals. By the 1990s, changes wrought by shifts to neo-liberal policies were dramatically affecting media organizations, and ensuing complications arising from the economic crisis of 2001 continue to permit control of the media by the state. Those working within the contexts of such a system find their profession either stymied or encouraged, given the circumstances. By looking historically at changes in the media-state relations, together with regulatory shifts and accompanying economic transitions, it is hoped that this case study will provide a useful base for other research in Latin American media."
2006-0712,Informational Compensation and Comparative Judgments: An Exploration of Psychological Mechanisms Behind the Third-Person Perception,Understanding Cognitive Processing of Media Messages,Information Systems,,,Paper,Informational Compensation and Comparative Judgments: An Exploration of Psychological Mechanisms Behind the Third-Person Perception,Understanding Cognitive Processing of Media Messages,"Within the framework of social judgment under the condition of inadequate information, this paper explores the psychological mechanisms behind the third-person perception (TPP). It is proposed that the TTP can be conceived as a two-stage process: information retrieval and comparative evaluation; and that cognitive factors and motivational factors work together to produce TPP. Data from a web-based survey with 575 participants provided some evidence for the two-stage process. Individuals rely on heuristic cues such as media schemas when estimating effectsthey rely on the media components of such schemas similarly, but use the audience components of such schemas more when estimating effects on others than on self. Driven by self-enhancing motives, individuals also engage in egocentric inferences. At the comparative evaluation stage, there was strong evidence that the magnitude and direction of self-other perceptual gap were determined by characteristics of media message and target others combined. A more comprehensive approach to TPP is advanced; implications and directions for future studies are also discussed."

An earlier, central study on adults was replicated, through 330 in-depth interviews among three age groups (4-15). The involvement variable was manipulated similarly to the original study (a gift). The findings: children use only one route for changing attitudes, not two as in the original adult studies. Indeed, in all three age groups, the childrens position towards the advertisement was similar in both high and low involvement situations. We offer explanations for the surprising findings."

Yet little is known about information seeking behavior of incumbent employees, although they are the majority in many organizations. The field study was conducted to examine how incumbent employees in a contemporary organization seek information during organizational change from a relational perspective. The data from 124 employees of a public library that was about to face budget cuts indicated that incumbents use three different types of communication networks (i.e., organization-wide, workgroup, personal) depending on the level of perceived social costs. In addition, this study explored if perceived social costs differentiate the use of communication channels available in the contemporary workplace."

The study explored the impact of online policy discussions among health-care elites (N=163) and ordinary citizens (N=1,400) alike, through a multi-wave panel study in which a subset of study participants, randomly assigned, was asked to participate in a series of two small-group deliberations about health care policy reform. Results suggest (a) that participation in online deliberations leads to higher levels of opinion holding on matters of health care policy; (b) that participation leads to substantive and interpretable shifts in policy preferences; and (c) that the shifts induced by deliberation reflect movement toward more informed and politically sophisticated positions."

Fourteen thousand eight hundred fourteen viewers completed a survey during Season 3, when the program featured a story on the release of a deadly infectious agent in a Los Angeles hotel. Viewing the action drama significantly influenced attitudes about sheltering in place, beliefs about the consequences of violating quarantine, knowledge of how viruses are spread, and the methods used to track an exposed person. The program was less successful in educating the public about the definitions of isolation and quarantine. Implications for utilizing the entertainment-education format are discussed."

Here one is able to detect communicative processes which are lively, vibrant and equipped with a remarkable durability. Nevertheless, flame-wars or down-shuts also occur. The question arouse what explains these differences in group success? A satisfying answer relay on a complex interplay of different variables like user-structure, group age, and topics. We will provide a framework to analyze these interdependencies systematically. Challenges for such a framework are threefold: a) communication must be the key concept, b) it has to take into account the relational, network aspect c) as well as the dynamic of the communicative process. Based on concepts like interactivity, social visibility and elements of Luhmanns system theory, we provide a research matrix that distinguish four analytical levels (message, thread, actor, topic) and combines them with four communicative dimensions (relational, subject, temporal, social)."

It describes the curriculum, positions it within the differing philosophies and traditions in media literacy scholarship, and provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of the effects of participation on the knowledge and attitudes of the students. Pre- and post-curriculum comparisons are drawn from responses to open-ended survey questions, a media clip analysis exercise, and closed-ended survey items, with each providing evidence that sixth graders acquired a new understanding of media violence and real-life conflict and learned new concepts that facilitated such understanding (such as the lens model of conflict mediation, lack of consequences in media violence portrayals, and the role of realism in media portrayals in increasing the likelihood of media effects). Results have implications for media literacy initiatives in K-12 schools."

While modest evidence for intercandidate agenda-setting regarding issue salience was obtained, more robust support was present for attribute salience relationships. In light of these findings, the theoretical and practical implications for political public relations are discussed."

This study used a survey design (N = 444) to examine the likelihood of social initiative, motivation to communicate with culturally different others and intercultural friendships moderating the relationship between sensation seeking and risk-taking behaviors. The results of the study showed that sensation seeking is positively related to all risk-taking behaviors. Social initiative, motivation, and intercultural friendship do not moderate the relationship between sensation seeking and risk-taking behaviors. However, results do reveal that social initiative is inversely related to delinquency; motivation is inversely related to alcohol consumption, drinking and driving, fighting, delinquency, and drugs; and intercultural friendship is inversely related to alcohol consumption."

This exploratory-comparative study uses contextual analysis to examine how differences in perspectives toward the environmental issues and activism may influence internationalization of news. Internationalization of news coverage is defined as the ability of the news format to connect similar projects around the world. Internationalization would extend the salience of environmental issues faced at a local level to a global level and connect like-minded people, often with similar fates. The controversy surrounding hydroelectric projects, faced currently by many nations, was chosen as the environmental issue to be examined."

Given the paucity of literature on the subject within public relations, we pull from literature in business ethics, human rights, medical research ethics, conflict negotiation, philosophy, and other fields written by competing voices from various regions of the world to add depth and context to the discussion. Finally, we turn to ecofeminist ethics, postcolonial feminist ethics, and identity ethics to propose areas for future development of an integrated ethical theory that would inform international practice."

The rapid expansion of international womens magazines in Korea is closely related to the growth of the transnational advertisers which have high interest in affluent middle-class consumers in Korea. With this in mind, this study examines the expansion process of international womens magazines in Korea and their influence on Korean local womens magazines, by paying attention to the role of transnational advertising in the process.

A content analysis was used for this research. To examine how international womens magazines are closely related to transnational advertising, this study compared advertisements of international womens magazines with those of local Korean local womens magazines. Based on the circulation figure and popularity, two Korean editions of international womens magazines, Elle and Vogue, and two local Korean womens magazines, Yeosung Joongang and Women Sense, were selected. Thus, total four magazines, issued on March or April 2004, were analyzed.

The results imply that international womens magazines are more commercialized than local womens magazines and they play an important role to disseminate the standardized and Westernized transnational advertising."

For the purpose, this paper tested the difference between Internet use and TV use, especially focusing on the differential use of a) genre, b) motives, and c) perception of both medium. Some tests were done with divided four groups (both light users, TV heavy users, Internet heavy users, both heavy users) based on the degree of use. Results show that the different uses between heavy user and light user are shown only in limited variables. Big different uses are found only for the primary uses of a medium or the uses having relative superiority over the other. Conclusively, although people spend more time on a medium, the high frequency of use does not necessarily lead so called all or nothing strategy to be adopted to changed media environment. Rather, peoples reaction to the new medium may be rational as a partial substitute or eclectic supplement by assessing one mediums relative superiority over the other, rather than complete change of media using patterns and related perceptions."

However, prior research has ignored a crucial role of self-efficacy in the process of information processing. Indeed, few studies explore the possibility that patients actual information seeking can be influenced by interaction between emotion and self-efficacy. We address this issue by examining the interplay of emotions and self-efficacy in determining individuals health information seeking behaviors. Further, we explored how negative emotion and self-efficacy were affected as a result of health information use over the Internet. Analyzing the data collected from 122 breast cancer patients, we found that negative emotions and self-efficacy jointly affect use of health information. Among patients high in self-efficacy, negative emotions were positively related to the amount of information search, while among those low in self-efficacy, negative emotions were negatively related to the amount of information search. The results also showed that there were some significant effects on self-efficacy after use of health information in the first 2 month but not on negative emotion. Implication for future research on emotion, self-efficacy, and use of health information are discussed."

Forty Chinese-Canadian dyads participated in the study which was carried out in Canada. Half of the dyads were randomly assigned to the experimental group and half to the control group. Males and females were evenly distributed in both experimental and control groups. Prior to their conversations, participants in the experimental group received a short training, whereas the control group did not receive any training. Major Findings include: 1) in comparison with the untrained dyads, the trained dyads exhibited higher frequencies of successful interruptions, documenting the positive impact of training on intercultural face-to-face communication. The higher frequencies of unsuccessful interruptions displayed by the untrained dyads indicate a lack of congruity to the extent that they sometimes cannot successfully insert an interruption. 2) Chinese participants engaged in more cooperative interruptions than Canadians who displayed more intrusive interruptions, lending support for a major theory in Cross-Cultural psychology: Individualism-Collectivism. 3) The Canadians rated the Chinese as less relaxed than Chinese rated the Canadians, indicating that the second-language speakers have higher anxiety levels than native speakers in intercultural interactions, providing support for previous research and raising challenges for intercultural training."

The main argument is that those methods and techniques of collecting and representing others voices, have played an essential role in the establishment of what might be called modern journalism. The paper distinguishes four aspects of modern journalism: (1) Journalism as a relatively autonomous institution, (2) claims of objectivity, (3) formats and design, (4) establishment of internal journalistic discourses. An empirical study of two dominating Swedish newspapers is used to describe and analyse changes over time in relation to those four aspects. The material consists of all political news articles during the month of April in 1915, 1935, 1955, 1975 and 1995. The study demonstrates several fundamental changes in the role of interviewing and quoting during the period."

This study investigates the primary digital divide regarding Internet adoption and the secondary digital divide relating to Internet use, specifically health information seeking. In particular, the relationships among socio-demographics, health consciousness, Internet adoption, health status, and Internet expertise are examined in a sample of online health information seekers. Data analyses were conducted on 3021 respondents as well as on the subset of 2160 respondents who were self-reported Internet users from the 2003 DDB Needham LifeStyles Database, based on the results of a nationally representative postal-mail survey. Logistic regression was used to analyze the effects of demographics and health consciousness on Internet adoption. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the unique effects of demographics, health status, health conscientiousness, and Internet expertise on health information seeking. Findings evidenced various primary and secondary digital divide factors that undergird Internet use and online health information seeking. Health care professionals and health communicators should be cognizant of social stratification patterns underlying Internet use and online health seeking behaviors, in their attempt to narrow the health information gaps between the haves and have-nots."

In the last three years, however, the issue has once again come to the foreground of American public debate with unprecedented actions taken on all sides. Despite the fact that gay rights and concerns are not usually given regular coverage in the mass media, a significant portion of these debates has played out in the mainstream press. Moreover, this coverage has been largely sympathetic to advocates for same-sex marriage. However, more radical ideas which question the institution of marriage are almost, but not completely absent from the mainstream press. When the more queer or radical idea that marriage is not liberating and that rights and benefits need to be extended broadly not reserved for a few is expressed it tends to come from those in family law and the academy. The potential for queer critics and activists to take advantage of the fact that some people are managing to get radical ideas into the mainstream news media suggests that there may be a way to work for more radical, structural changes within the limitations and opportunities of liberal politics and the politics of the everyday."

On Alterity, Mainstreaming and the Radical Media",Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"In its nine-year history, the Arab satellite news network Al Jazeera has been the subject of much debate. From glorification to vilification, the station has been described as radical by its detractors and as an alternative medium by its admirers. Since the launch of the war in Afghanistan in October 2001, Al Jazeera, already of immense popularity in the Arab world, solidified its reputation as the go-to source for alternative news for much of the Western hemisphere. Currently, the station is in an ambivalent position vis-à-vis its regional and global audiences -- in some instances serving as the sole voice of discursive dissent and in others acting as the major mainstream broadcaster in the Arab world. This paper assesses the narratives of nativity and alterity as they pertain to Al Jazeera, thereby comparing its corporate institutional wholesaler properties to the stations seemingly contradictory role as an alternative news provider. Does Al Jazeera fall into the category of alternative media? In its current structure, how do characterizations of the station as counter-hegemonic fare?"

The abundance of Western products often leads people to assume that the luxury consumption and Western materialistic values will also be imported along with those Western cultural goods. To test this assumption, an empirical study about the relationship between Chinese youths media consumption and materialist values was conducted in Shanghai, the most commercial city in Mainland China, in 2004. We found that there did emerge materialism among Chinese young people. However, the complicated results in this study provide both of the evidence and challenge to the traditional media imperialism thesis."

An Examination of Sex Appeal in Promos and Sexual Self-Schema,Advances in Advertising Research II,"Sex is a prominent feature in promos. The effects of sex appeal in promos, however, have received little scholarly research. This study tested the efficacy of both sexual appeal in promos and a personality variable, sexual-self schema, in predicting consumers attitudes toward the promos, the advertised programs, watching intentions, as well as self-reported arousal. Results showed that sex appeal had main effects on all dependent variables, and moderate sexual appeal generally induced the most favorable responses. In contrast, sexual-self schema was not a significant predictor in affecting participants responses. The practical and theoretical implications of this research are then discussed."

Clearly, there was a greater focus on Islam in the period from 1998 to 2004. Islam as such, without making any distinction as to what kind of Islam, has been a much-discussed item since 9/11 and has often been related to terrorism, fundamentalism, the suppression of women and violence. However, at this point a distinction must be made between foreign Islam and Dutch Islam. Foreign Islam is more often associated with terrorism than Dutch Islam. Reporting on Dutch Islam generally involves religion and politics, although the killing of Theo van Gogh on November 2, 2004, changed the picture in that Dutch Islam too became frequently tied up with terrorism. A comparative analysis of articles written before and after the murder reveals that journalists began to write about Muslims from a more negative viewpoint after November 2. Yet, after the murder, articles tended to be longer and journalists did more investigative work of their own. The Netherlands clearly became the focus of attention and the Middle East lost some of its importance. With regard to the frames used, news reports after November 2 tended to give more weight to aspects of morality and responsibility, although the conflict frame acquired more importance when Dutch Islam was dealt with."

However, the continuous flow of migration, technological innovations and other phenomena linked to globalisation undermine the sovereignty of the nation. In this context, multiculturalism has arisen as a means by which to reconcile the nation with some of the challenges it faces due to its pluralisation. Yet, paradoxically, multiculturalism seems to presuppose a robust nation-state, based on secular conceptions of citizenship. Multiculturalism can be interpreted as anchoring the nation more firmly within Western modernity, and its discourses on tolerance. The upshot of this is that some communities may be politically excluded, marginalised or otherwise constructed as threatening.

Within this background, this paper will explore the implications of online communication for reconsidering multiculturalism. The specific focus here is on Islam on the internet, since Islam has been placed at the centre of multicultural controversies. Focusing on the internet is equally crucial, as it has created a new communicative space that transcends the barriers of the nation and the face-to-face communication associated with the public sphere. By examining Islam on the internet this contribution will seek to explore the ways in which different online communicative forms are employed, and to identify their addressees and their communicative goals. These findings will be related to the debate on multiculturalism: can multiculturalism be viewed as viable in contexts that are increasingly understood as transnational?"

This is surprising, given the very nature of issue advocacy campaigns involves the communication of often-controversial opinions in an effort to sway public sentiment or generate support. This study expands the intermedia agenda setting literature by examining the agenda setting function of issue advocacy campaigns. Specifically, the study focused on an issue advertising campaign by the coal industry and its impact on television news coverage. The study provides initial evidence that issue advertising may play an important role in shaping the medias agenda. While the correlation between issue advertising at time 1 and the television news agenda at time 2 was moderately strong (+.536), the Spearman correlation coefficient between these time periods exceeded the Rozelle-Campbell baseline statistic, suggesting a potentially dynamic relationship between issue advertising and the television news agenda."

While most of this research has involved surveys (questionnaires and interviews) and case studies of supervisor perceptions, only a few studies have also considered student perceptions. Most of the perceptions have considered student difficulties when writing the thesis as a whole, rather than particular sections. The present study, based on the use of in-depth interviews with four supervisor-student pairs, focused on student difficulties in writing the discussion of results section (DRS) of the thesis and investigated the extent to which the perceptions of the students matched those of their supervisors. The study found that (1) students had a more limited understanding of the function of the DRS compared to that of their supervisors, (2) common understanding between the supervisors and the students about the nature and cause of the students difficulties was limited and (3) students tended to use limited proficiency as a default mode of explanation of their difficulties whereas three out of the four supervisors offered explanations not related to second language proficiency."

The local media avoided the topic and homosexual activities had flourished without publicity through the years. Recent admission by a top-ranking official to an international news magazine that the Singapore government has revised its policy to prevent discrimination against homosexuals opened the floodgates for media publicity, with the international media began naming Singapore as Asias new pink capital. The public declaration of Singapore as a gay haven spooked the government, who sought a subtle approach to discipline and control the public behavior of homosexuals: through discourse about homosexuality in the national newspaper. This paper examines news coverage of a senior government officials claim that the rise of HIV/Aids cases in Singapore is due to the promiscuous lifestyles of homosexuals and argues that Singapores national daily, in framing homosexuality as promiscuous and contrary to traditional values, served as a platform for the government to reestablish control and subvert homosexuality in Singapore."

The present study focused on the effects of playing violent video games in male adolescents of lower intelligence. Theoretical perspectives from media effects and entertainment research lead to the inclusion of viewer interpretation variables. It was hypothesized that aggressiveness as effect of playing violent video games is moderated by perceived realism and identification as well as by trait aggressiveness. Aggressive behavior was measured by punishing behavior in a competitive reaction time task. The results of a 2 (violent vs. non violent game) x 2 (reality vs. fantasy game) experiment among Dutch lower secondary school boys (N = 108) revealed that aggressive behavior as a result of violent game playing was increased by wish-identification. However, playing a realistic video game lead to more aggressiveness than playing a fantasy game, regardless of the level of violence. The effects were further moderated by personality traits (sensation seeking and altruism) but not trait aggressiveness. In addition, qualitative results from in-depth interviews are presented."
2006-0761,Job Crafting and the Metaconversation,Reframing Organizational Metaphors,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Job Crafting and the Metaconversation,Reframing Organizational Metaphors,"In this paper, two different concepts regarding the relation between organization members and their working environment are examined. The first concept is job crafting (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001; Wrzesniewski, Dutton & Debebe, 2003), and represents a paradigm shift in management theory from a passive attitude-bearing worker to an (en)active worker who, through reflection and interaction, crafts the images of his or her job, role and self in organizational contexts. The second concept is metaconversation (Robichaud, Giroux & Taylor, 2004), which unveils how the image of an organization emerges through the recursive nature of language. We will compare the concepts of job crafting and metaconversation to show parallels between the concepts, and explore ways in which the two different perspectives on these sensemaking processes can take advantage of the efforts and tools that are used in the study of the other perspective."

This paper argues that, in contrast, the relationship between journalism and democracy would be best served by an agonistic understanding of democracy, as employed in the work of Claude Lefort, and Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe. The paper argues that journalism is an integral communicative form of modernity that involves a necessary and indissoluble tension between emancipatory and governmental impulses. Journalism is involved in the production of democratic freedoms but the indeterminacy of democracy also renders society problematic and subject to governance and journalism is also central to such strategies. Journalisms role in social organization and management is explained with reference to Michel Foucaults account of governmentality."
2006-0763,Journalism and Expertise: The MMR/Autism Story,Reporting Science,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Journalism and Expertise: The MMR/Autism Story,Reporting Science,"To better understand the difference between sources and experts, this paper argues for the creation of a new source category of expert-sources. Collins and Evans (2004) categories of expertise are used as a basis for this discussion. This new category aims to help journalists, academics and the public understand that expert-sources and sources have different roles, influences and power and that there should be limits to their contributions, both in journalism and in wider society. The research is based on content, production and reception research carried out on the MMR/autism story. Since 1998, the British media have closely followed one scientists research alleging links between the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism and/or inflammatory bowel disease. The analysis will argue that journalists construction of expertise was excessively broad and that the elevation of parents to experts understandably led to particular interpretations of the story. This case study addresses a gap in media studies as little research examines the reasons behind using expert-sources or the impact of the use of expert-sources in the media."

Journalism can certainly be asked to participate in the offering of reason; but by requiring that reasons appeal to principles that cannot be reasonably rejected by citizens seeking fair terms of cooperation, deliberative democracy makes a stern request. Because reasons given in actual political argument regularly fail to meet this demanding criterion, journalism cannot be content to passively transcribe those arguments or to preside over an uncritical forum for their expression. Journalism must itself be a reasoning institution that aggressively pursues and compelling renders reasons satisfying the criterion. To regulate this process deliberative democracy employs a morally sensitive vocabulary  e.g. publicity, mutual accountability, reciprocity  that clearly suggests standards of journalistic performance. These standards recognize the mission of the news media to be not only a resource for citizen education but also a social institution seeking the accountability of other institutions. Using the vocabulary of deliberative democracy, this paper offers a case study of journalism as a reason-giving institution in pursuit of justice. The case is one newspapers campaign for reform of capital punishment, a multi-year program of investigative reports and editorials that made public many instances of injustice and demanded that the criminal justice system account for them. This body of work helped set the terms of debate on the death penalty and provides a model of constructive journalistic reason-giving in a situation of deep disagreement."

The author employs a combination of content analysis of the decision-making process of gatekeepers and an in-depth interview with the metro editor. The results of this study show that news criteria are similar, not only between first-line journalists and their editors, but also between the predecessor and the successor to the position of the metro section editor. Consequently, this study, which adopts White's 1949 gatekeeping research approach, illustrates that individual forces in gatekeeping tenuously influence the selection of news items."

The study found that the journalists were self-referential, i.e., they were more influenced by their media routines and organizations than by extra media factors in covering news, etc. On the other hand, in their public journalism roles to address HIV/AIDS, these journalists were mostly influenced by extra media factors. That is, the higher the influence of community, advertisers, sources, technology and such, the more important they considered the public journalism roles. Thus while they considered internal factors as greater influences on the content of the news, they considered extra media factors as greater influences on the roles they would play for addressing social issues."

Yet what is largely absent in debates on journalists democratic responsibilities is terms or analytical frameworks with which to develop a concept of cultural or multicultural responsibilities. Mark Deuze (2001: 129) notes that the social responsibilities of the news media have been well documented and established as a doctrine in contemporary journalism. In the context of globalisation, increased migration and the theorisation of cultural or multicultural citizenship one may therefore expect today's journalism to develop equivalent multicultural responsibilities (ibid). This paper presents a repertoire analysis of normative expectations of journalists and journalism in the reporting of cultural diversity in Australia. The analysis identifies two prevalent arguments for understanding journalists' multicultural responsibilities: the argument for journalism standards or 'business as usual', and an argument for 'considering the consequences'. The discourse of democratic responsibilities provides conceptual resources such as the Fourth Estate, the watchdog of democracy, free speech and providing a voice for the voiceless that can be applied to the reporting of cultural diversity. However, interviewees themselves suggest that the language of journalists political obligations may be inadequate to the challenges and possibilities of reporting multicultural Australia."
2006-0769,Joysticking the Global Village: Digital Games & Globalist Labour Networks,Game Studies Top Papers,Game Studies,,,Paper,Joysticking the Global Village: Digital Games & Globalist Labour Networks,Game Studies Top Papers,"Video game research is trans-disciplinary and novel. This study, not un-problematically, sidesteps many pressing questions of interactivity, narrativity, ludology, gender, race, and more, to ask different questions of these social media. The focus here is upon the organizational workings of the commercial industry that makes popular games available; the very means of production and distribution for these media.

What incentives and obstacles face capitalist globalisation and concentration of ownership in the games industry? How can small or independent developers compete? This interpretivist case study seeks to address these questions.

Sklair, Johnson and McLuhan offer frameworks to understand the global village - a theoretical construct which has not been fully applied to the gaming industry. Nonetheless, the socio-economic preconditions of the gaming industry suggest that the surprising relationsships between globalization and the industry are of crucial importance to consumers.

While economic globalization theories suggests that, since labour is a games greatest development cost, money-conscious developers should outsource much of their labour to weak economic markets. However, this study reveals the difficulties involved in doing so, and that the worlds leading developer is moving in the other direction.

As communication scholars set to define the realm of discourse around games, the need to take a wide view of the games industry grows pressing. In the years following the Battle in Seattle, issues of global labour practices and concentrated ownership are of great public and academic concern. This paper examines the complicated economic networks that give rise to these new media."

Alexis de Tocqueville, the U.S. Supreme Court, and democratic theorists have hypothesized that the American jury system quietly promotes ongoing civic engagement by giving reluctant citizens an opportunity to deliberate on matters of public consequence. A series of three studies examines this claim with regard to the impact of jury deliberation on electoral participation. Twelve in-depth interviews with recent jurors demonstrated that jurors conceptualized jury deliberation and voting as related responsibilities. A study of court and voting records for 13,237 empanelled jurors from eight counties across the United States demonstrated that this deliberative experience can significantly increase turnout among previously infrequent voters. The final study examined 8,483 King County (Washington) residents who reported for jury service and demonstrated that both ones objective and subjective experience of jury service impact future voting rates. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence of the long-term civic impact of jury service."

You Don't Need to Remember: The Effects of Entertainment Media on Political Information Acquisition and Information Processing in Political Judgment,Political Communication Top Faculty Papers,"This study investigates whether different types of media (i.e., news vs. entertainment media) produced different patterns of political information acquisition and of information processing (i.e., memory- vs. on-line-based information processing) in making a political judgment (i.e., evaluation of a political actor). With the adult sample (18-64), the study adopts an experimental design utilizing 20 minute collections of real news and entertainment programs (the Daily Show with Jon Stewart) dealing with the Supreme Court Justice and Chief Justice nomination process (plus a baseline group exposed to science documentaries).The results indicated that entertainment media are less effective in acquiring factual information, particularly holding issue and procedure knowledge. The study, for the first time, reveals that entertainment media facilitates on-line-based political information processing whereas news media promotes memory-based political information processing. The implications for the theoretical development of the impact of entertainment media and for citizen competency in the changes of political information environment are discussed."

It will be argued that the virtually non-existent space which Foucault leaves open for social progress is unnecessarily limited by an overly deterministic theory of language. In contrast to this theory, language in a Lacanian model is neither ubiquitous nor coherent  thereby undermining Foucaults assertions that languages role as a capillary of power necessarily disables efficacious resistance. Instead, to the extent that language is disrupted by gaps and lack, power emerges as unstable and fragile. A theory of radical democracy is developed in light of this theory of power, rehabilitating the notion a citizen subject and of political agency."

But how well are students being prepared for the realities of the profession in the region? With the end of aiding communication educators and their students in Latin America, this study delineated certain perceptions held by media professionals working in Latin America. Communicators in four nations discussed frustrations, opinions, complaints and feelings during a series of focus group discussions. While there were minute differences between groups, much of the discussion held common threads that emerged in data revision. Exhaustion and frustration caused by long workdays and low incentives and low morale appeared to be mitigated by the fascination produced by public recognition and popularity conferred by working in the media, and having the ability to be omnipresent in modern society."
2006-0774,Laughter in Small Talk: Aspects from Romanian Interactions,Language & Social Interaction Top Papers,Language & Social Interaction,,,Paper,Laughter in Small Talk: Aspects from Romanian Interactions,Language & Social Interaction Top Papers,"In this paper, we start from the assumption that laughter is a universal of humans, in the sense that its physical manifestation is identical for all the people in the world, but it is triggered by culturally-dependant stimuli.
The excerpts we will use are taken from naturally occurring face-to-face interactions and from phone calls, and they are instances of three types of small talk: keep in touch small talk, before business talk small talk, and transitional small talk.
Our focus is on how laughter is triggered without the speaker actually inviting laughter. Thus, our interest is to see if the speaker, in his utterance, marked in any way that he expected a reaction (laughter included) from his receiver. We will distinguish between overt marking of laughable units (within-speech laughter, independent laughter at the end of the utterance), by means of which the speaker invites laughter, and covert marking of laughable units, i.e. volunteered laughter is produced.
Another issue of interest will be to see whether laughter is used in small talk in order to transmit the speaker that (s)he could go on with the topic or, on the contrary, stop. This means that speakers may overtly mark their utterance as laughable, thus inviting their audience to share laughter. Some other times, there are situations when laughter may not be replied positively."

A total of 140 articles were collected from scholarly journals and popular publications listed in the JSTOR and Reader's Guide to Periodic Literature. The content analysis shows that many of the driving forces and problems that exist with distance education today existed in the early years of correspondence programs offered through university extension programs. The principle reasons for supporting distance education were improved access to education, non-residence programs for working families and new opportunities for universities to expand enrollments. The problems that hamper the credibility of distance courses were spurious diploma programs, aggressive sales and marketing techniques and unresolved questions regarding whether residence programs should accept credit given for distance courses. Many of the problems that plague distance education programs today existed in the early years of distance learning."

Content analysis can infer implications related to adolescent television exposure. Previous content analyses illustrate that sex is prominent in television programs popular among adolescents, although a gap exists regarding programs popular among African Americans. Because African American adolescents, compared to other adolescents, watch more television and are disproportionately affected by sexual health outcomes, filling this gap is of critical importance.

Objective: This study explored the sexual content in 68 episodes of 6 African American situation comedies from the 2004-2005 UPN season.

Results: Sexual talk and behavior were prevalent in 100% and 75% of episodes, respectively. Of the 356 scenes with any sexual content, 33.1% included behavior and 86.2% included talk. Furthermore, risk or responsibility was addressed in only 9.8% of scenes with sexual talk and 0% of scenes with sexual behavior.

Conclusion: African American situation comedies contain a large amount of sexual content. The prevalence is higher than in previous published content analyses of programs popular among adolescents. While sexual intercourse was found in 12 scenes, almost one in every three scenes included talk about intercourse that occurred or talk toward sex. In other words, norms about sexual intercourse may be offered indirectly. In an age where STIs are affecting African American youth disproportionately, greater effort should be placed on normalizing protective behaviors. If television does, in fact, serve as a sex educator for African American youth, then television shows should incorporate more themes of risk and responsibility."

This study discusses the current state of newspapers in Mississippi in relation to the decisions to publish wedding, union or engagement announcements or to deny access to same-sex couples. Phone interviews were used to generate data regarding specific decisions to accept or deny publication of such items at newspapers throughout the state. These results were examined in relation to recent polling data showing how counties within Mississippi voted in regards to the ban of same-sex marriage referendum on the 2004 ballot. Results show that there is little correlation between community voting behavior and newspapers decisions regarding the inclusion of such announcements."

Deficiencies in interpersonal and social relationships increase individuals risk for becoming chronically lonely. The more pathological consequences of loneliness are to be found among those adults who develop personality and adaptation disorders, such as alcohol abuse, loss of self-esteem, extreme forms of anxiety, powerlessness, and stress (de Jong Gierveld, 1998). Based on the idea that chronic feelings of loneliness may have roots in early childhood experiences, a mediational model of parental alcoholism effects on loneliness among adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs) using Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969) as the theoretical framework was proposed, tested, and validated in the current study. Participants (N = 422) completed retrospective reports of parental alcoholism, family environment, and parental attachment, and current reports of emotional expressivity, social support, loneliness, and life satisfaction. Results offered support for the hypothesized mediational model. Family environment, parental attachment, expressivity, and social support mediated the effects of parental alcoholism on loneliness in adulthood, which, in turn mediated the effects of these variables on life satisfaction. The model explained 15% of the variance in social loneliness, 11% of the variance in emotional loneliness, and 39% of the variance in life satisfaction. Results are discussed within the context of the literature reviewed."

Thus, we explore how different forms of computer mediated communication enhance different type of social networks. To explore this research question, we analyzed the longitudinal survey. Our first random sample survey of 1,320 adults was conducted in November, 2002, in Japan. Our second survey was conducted in March 2005 for 1002 respondents who completed the first survey. We got the data of 432 respondents who completed both surveys. The results show that more often people send PC mails they have more diverse social networks. On the other hand, mobile phones are not useful to enhance network diversity. This may be because mobile phones are not well suited to afford connections to sites where weak tie relationships may be formed, such as chat rooms and issue-oriented sites. In contrast, the results indicate that mobile phones are useful to maintain strong ties with people who provide social support. Finally, this study also shows that mobile phone internet use does not substitute for PC use. It would seem that these two technologies operate independently, each serving their own use for different relationship."

Based on a case study, the authors develop and specify elements of a theory of public trust. Thereby, they identify social phenomena (trust factors) and mechanisms (discrepancies), which affect trust building processes. The presented empirical data are extracted from a recent and very important case in Germany that examines the loss of trust in the former chief executive officer of the Federal Employment Office (BA). The findings not only show that the mechanisms of public communication processes and processes of public trust building are strongly interdependent, but they provide as well relevant insights in the way of managing such situations of public crisis."

At the heart of Ognianovas model is the idea that transitional countries are those that are moving from one type of economy to another. In this environment, newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and TV stations tend to align themselves with one of a wide variety of antagonistic normative press philosophies. Interviews revealed that Moldovan journalists represent a mix of press philosophies consistent with Ognianovas transitional model. Furthermore, the coexistence of such varied press philosophies can be found in both the 1992 and 2005 interviews, suggesting that Moldovan journalisms transitional status has remained the same for more than a decade. Findings expand the scope of the transitional model both economically and geographically."

The economic, political and social theories that explain the existence and roles of nonprofits in society are presented. Attention is given to examining the LPFM policy documents created by the Federal Communications Commission in search of language which supports or refutes the roles expected of these new licensees as suggested by the theories of the nonprofit sector. The findings of the policy document review are presented and discussed and these results are compared to results from an open-ended survey of LPFM stations. Although the stations mirror some of the language and expected roles found in the Commissions documents, they also appear to negotiate their own role in their communities."

The most extensive one is the concept of civil society by Jürgen Habermas. We will very briefly introduce it as theoretical framework of the study. Recent studies concentrate on the internet and its contributions to deliberative qualities of democracy (cf. Dahlgren, 2001). We instead want to focus on an area which has sustained little empirical research yet: periodicals edited by Nonprofit-Organizations for their members. Our main research question is: Can those magazines be appropriate communication platforms of the civil society? We conducted a written survey among the editors-in chief of magazines published by private Nonprofit Organizations in Switzerland. Besides formal aspects, we were especially interested in the perceived functions of the journals. We observed the tendency that the more professional a publication is in terms of layout and circulation, the more likely it is influenced by a political or by an economic logic."

Factor analysis gauges four distinguished news frames: military consequences, game, ideology and conflict. Post hoc analyses show that, within people, conflict frame is used less often than three other frames. Between websites, the conflict frame is more salient in sina than in people.

The author suggests that in China, online news frames are identical with the frames underlying traditional mainstream medias coverage on Taiwan. Generic frames and issue-specific frames can be detected simultaneously. This study also verifies the validity of the deductive approach in measuring news frames."

Despite identified brides between the two, this paper points to seemingly insurmountable differences. It also addresses the issue of applicability of homogenization and agenda setting to the new media environment, as the reconceptualization of production, dissemination and reception of content might have decreased the validity of the powerful effects generally, and of the distinction between critical and administrative specifically. It concludes by presenting how the two approaches change due to the new ICTs, how they might adapt, and how they should be researched."

ECM is a Web based publishing system that manages large numbers of electronic documents and other Web assets intended for publication to Web portals and other complex Web sites. Work in nonprofit organizations (NPOs) can benefit from adopting new communication technologies that promote collaboration and enterprise-wide knowledge management. The unique characteristics of ECM are enumerated and analyzed from a knowledge management perspective. We identify three stages of document life-cycles in ECM implementations: content, reification, and commodification/process (CRCP). We present the CRPC model as a mechanism for decision-makers and scholars to evaluate the organizational impacts of systems such as ECM. We also argue that NPO decision-makers should take care to avoid overly-commodifying business processes in the final stage where participation may be more beneficial than efficiency."

The analyses use Scotts (1995) institutional model as a framework to consider the regulatory, normative and cognitive-cultural influences on childrens media environments, and to argue that new media offer unique opportunities to study how parents attempt to regulate childrens media usage through a combination of technologies, rating systems, self-designed rules and social awareness."

This case study examines journalist's responses to rhetorical claims in one such controversy. Facing research findings that an explosion of industrial hog farms in North Carolina showed disproportionate siting of these facilities in poor African-American communities, and that neighbors of mega-farms reported increased health problems, industry attacked the research as politically motivated ""pseudo-science"" and mobilized legal and political threats against the researcher, his community partners, and his university. Our findings offer fresh insight into how and why reporters respond to the strategic ignorance claims of actors who seek to discredit threatening science. In so doing, they contribute to growing scholarship on journalists' role in the social construction of ignorance."

This explosion of new social movement activism has been heralded as the age of new radical politics. Many theorists and activists understand new social movements, as replacing the working class as an agent for progressive social change. Scholars and activists now alike debate the possibilities for revolutionary change in this era of multinational capitalism and new nationalisms.
This paper examines some of the above claims in the context of the contemporary Serbian civil society. It explores the relationship between the civil society, activism, and narratives in Serbia. In particular, it examines the anti-Milosevic movement Otpor! (Resistance), and its discourse, practice and politics in public spaces, through an analysis of narratives of a set of roughly 20 interviews with Otpor! activists, aged 18-35.
In the following discussion, then, I will focus on some of the particular dilemmas of contemporary Serbian popular movements - they are dilemmas to do with the growing complexity of media life in the Serbian spaces. I ground my debate on particular uses of the notion of civil society in the narratives of Otpor! activists, while I focus on the question of how do Otpor! activists relate to Leftist/radical politics and the idea of civil society."
2006-0813,Mapping South,Visual Framing of Culture and Global Politics,Visual Studies,,,Paper,Mapping South,Visual Framing of Culture and Global Politics,"This paper analyses four maps of Southern Africa produced in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. It argues that the Travels of French explorer and ornithologist François Levaillant led to major and influential changes in map-making and how maps were used. The evidence from this comes from a map, based on the map in Levaillants Voyages and supervised by him, that was constructed by several artists as a commissioned gift for King Louis XVI in 1790. The map referred specifically to Levaillants Travels and to people, animals and birds in his account, thus forming part of a multi-media representation of travel and hunting.

Two later maps, one by Pisani (1793) and one by Barrow (1801), show that Levaillant influenced them in changing the expectations the public had of maps. In doing this, he played a major part in establishing the form and conventions of major forms of travel writing."

We argue that Caushun might experience failure because his music, and more importantly his music videos, will offer his target audience no way of seeing authenticity in his intersecting identities. That is, the viewing experience, theorized as the gaze (Mulvey,1975), when applied to Caushun demonstrates gaze gone wrong. He offers himself up as a homothug in a homophobic genre, even as the thug identity in hip-hop is marked by its hyper-masculine, violent, and homophobic rhetoric.

In an epoch that is seeing incredible scientific advances and an explosion in the availability of information to the general public, medical and science reporters, writers and editors are one of the key elements in delivering timely, accurate and sufficient information to the public about issues that can have a significant impact on their lives. But is that so? Building upon an analysis of the results of a nation-wide survey of 304 medical/science writers, reporters and editors the present study suggests that while these journalists have a high understanding of science and technology and a high regard about the quality of their scientific sources, they do not have a highly positive perception of the general public regarding its potential to understand scientific issues and are fervent supporters of digesting publicized scientific news; concomitantly they tend to perceive popular media as a strong influencer of the attitudes and beliefs of their readers."

In this study we content analyzed the speeches from the 2004 political conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties in order to see if gendered discourse was present and, if present, how it was strategically employed. Findings indicate that masculinity was used in the discourse of both political parties in order to shape party identity, and that a two-pronged strategy, which we describe as hyper-masculine, was used by the Republican Party to bolster party identity and discursively emasculate opponents."

The culmination of this trend toward democratization ended in the new EU where the 25 Members are passing the new Constitution. The European Union faces a crucial and complex multidimensional process, one of the most critical being the establishment of extensive popular support, as recent national referendum outcomes attest. Since citizens experience with the political system under which they live is to a large extent a mediated experience, understanding the role of the mass media in establishing European identity becomes decisively important.
In the context of the new Europe, the informational function of the media can be assumed to be of even higher relevance. In particular, the Internet emerges as a potentially influential medium because it provides the possibility of acquiring large amounts of political information from different sources.
This research aims to find evidence of whether, and if so in which ways, the media contribute to the emergence of European social identity, one that is supportive of the consolidation of the new Europe. Does the Internet as a mass medium in these states contribute to the emergence and stabilization of social identities that are congruent with these nations' recently inaugurated European Union status? Or are they, to the contrary, undermining the identity foundations of the EU members? This research attempts to answer these questions through secondary analysis of the Eurobarometer data."

Political communication researchers, nonetheless, face two challenges in attempt to understand these effects: (a) variability in political information environments--one-sided vs. mixed or crosscutting news information flows, and (b) variability in individual openness to persuasion--probability of both reception and acceptance of campaign information. We synthesize theoretical insights from the Columbia School 1940s campaign studies (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, & Gaudet, 1944) and the Converse-McGuire-Zaller reception-acceptance model (Zaller, 1992) to test the interactive effects of contextual information heterogeneity and individual receptivity to campaign information on vote decision-time. Employing a quasi-experimental design that contrasts one- and two-sided flows, detailed campaign-news content analyses, and exit-poll data, we find support for the hypothesized relationship between information heterogeneity, individual ambivalence, and time of decision. Implications of these findings for future research in political communication are discussed in conclusion."

This study therefore examines the merits and restrictions of one of the most prominent audit techniques: the Communication Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ). It does so by comparing CSQ results with results gathered through the critical incident technique. Both instruments were used to asses the quality of internal communication within three organizations. The results show that there is convergence in the findings of the techniques, and that the CSQ seems to have criterion-related validity. However, the CSQ does not explicitly address issues of decision-making, top-down and bottom-up communication, responsibilities and the extent to which rules and agreements are kept. We conclude that the CSQ is an appropriate instrument for gaining overall insights into the way employees evaluate aspects of organizational communication, but that the method may be less suitable for diagnosing specific communication problems and formulating recommendations."

However, little is known about the mechanism of these effects. One approach to understanding supportive communication has demonstrated that highly person-centered messages, which explicitly acknowledge and elaborate the feelings of a distressed individual, are perceived as being more helpful, supportive, and involved, and therefore the most effective at comforting. Classifying messages according to degree of person-centeredness requires trained coders and significant amounts of time. The purpose of the current study is to determine whether a computerized linguistic analysis tool can predict hand-scored person-centeredness, and also more specifically, to identify which linguistic categories are the best explanatory variables. A body of 334 messages drawn from online support groups for breast cancer patients was analyzed firstly by independent coders to assess person-centeredness, and secondly by a computerized linguistic analysis program to evaluate the messages across emotional and other linguistic dimensions. Regression models were used to test the extent to which linguistic dimensions are able to predict person-centeredness. Results indicate that word count is the strongest predictor of hierarchy, but that highly person-centered messages are also characterized by words expressing emotion and certainty."
2006-0821,Measuring Participation: A Secondary Data Analysis,Communication for Healthcare,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Measuring Participation: A Secondary Data Analysis,Communication for Healthcare,"Participation is an essential element in development programs. However, because of the lack of a fundamental definition, there is little known about the measures of participation in the literature of development communication.

This paper adopts Habermass theory of communicative action to define participation. The action theorys reconstructive characteristic implies that perhaps validity claims and speech conditions can be applied to empirical measures of participation.

With the help from Johns Hopkins University Center for Communication Programs, this study measures participation as communicative by means of conducting a secondary analysis of a national family planning program. Three groups of variables were selected from the original dataset to reflect speech conditions, and these speech condition indicators were applied to predict respondents contraceptive use as well as their attitudes toward family planning.

A loose relationship is found between speech conditions and family planning outcomes. Speech conditions can predict couples agreement on family planning method usage, but have little or no predictive power in other attitude or behavioral outcomes. The predictive success of couples agreement implies that regardless of the limitation of the secondary data analysis design and of the partially available indicators, perhaps communicative action variables are able to evaluate participation in a more carefully designed research model with direct measures."

The general conclusion, however, is that such participation is declining. However, the rates of decline (or increase) in these activities among certain racial and cultural groups, such as blacks compared with whites, is not so clear. Furthermore, the role of religion and the churchan important component in creating bonds and networks that encourage such participationhas received little attention among communication scholars. This study sought to examine the intricacies among race, religiosity, and political and civic engagement by expanding the current literature on social capital to include cultural and contextual components of church involvement. We found that in a national sample, blacks are more involved in their communities at a local level the more they attended and were involved with church. Implications for communication research, social capital, and measurement of race and culture are discussed."

Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), the paper evaluates the advertising practices of the leading 100 U.S. advertisers in 2003, in order to identify best practices and determine the efficiency of the advertising in these four types of media. The results reveal inefficiencies with each medium, relative to the advertisers expenditures, and also indicate less efficiency for newspaper and radio advertising for these advertisers than for expenditures on either TV or the Internet."

The results reveal not so much a polarized nation as one that sees reality through separate prisms, one comprised of a particularistic strain of Christian ethics, the other of secular reason. The paper develops a theory for understanding the themes underlying the discourse to clarify the meaning of moral issues. It also explains their role in creating political divisions that promote strict religion and its political allies. The analysis also explains why there is little incentive to compromise."

The research question of this paper asks how the news on government policies influences satisfaction with government policy. Apart from well known hypotheses such as agenda setting and priming, hypotheses are tested that deal with the question whether the government tries to increase policy satisfaction by communicating ambitions (its a mess, but we will do something against it) or by communicating successes (everything under control, due to us). The data to test the hypotheses come from a fourfold survey study to tap aspects of satisfaction with, the government policy with regard to 55 policy issues in addition to a longitudinal content analysis of 24 newspapers to unravel the media coverage of these issues.
The results show dissatisfaction everywhere. Most hypotheses stand the test. Increasing policy satisfaction by the communication of ambitions rather than of results appears to be the rule. The diffusion of negative perceptions of real world conditions may be a side-effect of the latter."

In the Copperbelt region of Zambia, where this study took place, it is estimated that 26% of the adult population is HIV positive. To make matters worse, HIV/AIDS is heavily stigmatized and thus the topic remains interpersonally taboo. Although few may be talking about it, media messages about HIV and AIDS are plentiful. The pandemic proportions of this disease along with the stigma surrounding it has created a climate in which interpersonal networks fail, leaving many Zambians dependent on media for HIV/AIDS information. Media System Dependency Theory predicts that media exposure has a greater impact on those who are more dependent on media. This paper examines a test of the theory among a sample of 285 working men (75.4%) and women (24.6%) in the Copperbelt region. Specifically, I examine whether being dependent on media for information about HIV/AIDS prevention results in attitudes more supportive of condom use when newspaper exposure increases. Results support MSD theory predictions. Implications are discussed."

Moreover, media education has come late to the social studies. Given the need for substantial curriculum development and teacher training in this area, educators can benefit from knowledge of how social studies teachers view media education in their field. This article reports on the results of a survey of social studies teachers seeking to integrate media education into their classrooms. An overview of how communication and education literature conceptualizes the aims of media education illustrates the range of goals that might influence these teachers and provides a context for our survey. We surveyed teachers on the goals that motivate their media education teaching, whether they value media education as a tool to teach about media or to enhance understanding of discrete social studies topics, and how comfortable they are with media education in their classrooms. Our results suggest that many teachers: are uncertain about how to integrate media education into their teaching; lack confidence analyzing media; view media education as a way to teach about social studies, rather than about the media per se; and emphasize different reasons for media education than those frequently stressed in theory and policy."
2006-0854,Media Enjoyment as a Function of Individual Responses and Emotional Contagion,Examining Individual Responses to Information Processing,Information Systems,,,Paper,Media Enjoyment as a Function of Individual Responses and Emotional Contagion,Examining Individual Responses to Information Processing,"The present study defines media enjoyment as viewers positive reactions toward the whole media experiences and proposes that both individual and social responses toward media content contribute to viewers overall experiences of media enjoyment. Adopting the idea of emotional contagion, the present study suggests that viewers tend to be affected by other viewers and synchronize their enjoyment with others. By comparing dyadic and individual conditions in an experimental setting, it is found that the two conditions demonstrate different patterns of media enjoyment. The results suggest that participants sitting in dyads tend to converge in their enjoyment with the peer viewers more so than participants who sit alone. The evidence supports the idea that media enjoyment is influenced both by individual responses and emotional contagion effects."

Using longitudinal panel survey data collected from 257 preadolescent girls at two points in time one year apart, we tested relationships between self-reported television and magazine exposure at wave 1, and current (prepubescent) and future (postpubescent) body ideals and disordered eating at wave 2. Controlling age, race, perceived body size, and the relevant criterion variables measured at wave 1, television viewing at wave 1 predicted increased disordered eating and a thinner postpubescent body ideal at wave 2. Media exposure did not, however, predict a thinner prepubescent body ideal at wave 2. These findings suggest that the thin-ideal internalization construct needs refinement to enhance its developmental sensitivity."

The present study explicated nine context-specific frames: unjustified invasion, contribution to world peace, international relations and/or politics, fortification of the Korea-U.S alliance, economic advantages from Iraqi reconstruction, inefficiency of elite-level policymaking process, disorganization of public opinion, security of Iraq and/or postings, and composition of troops. Using Galois lattice analysis of a total of 788 news articles of the Chosun Ilbo and the Hangyereh Shinmun, this paper tried to help understand the controversial troop-dispatch discourse at the macro-structural level, and at the same time interpret how the two local newspapers have framed the controversy."

Debates have been raging about the perceived homogenizing influence of the global media industry on local identities, cultures, and ideologies. Recent trends toward international concentration of mass media ownership, deregulation and privatization of national cultural industries, and new alliances between transnational media corporations and complacent governments, have led to the consolidation of market-driven journalism.This investigation will seek to outline some of the ways in which journalism and ethical practices are being shaped by the complicated processes of globalization, especially journalism in two countries of the South: South Africa and India. The paper will contextualize the broader debates about media globalization by considering journalism ethics and occupational ideologies within their material  political, economic, and cultural  contexts."

Television in Ghana has transitioned from the role of development to that of reflecting the global and local phenomena.

The qualitative content analysis approach was employed to analyze the contents of television program guides and the results were related to the issues of development, dependency, globalization, and localization.

The findings showed more local than global programs on GTV during the period under study. Most of the global programs in the categories of news, sports, sit-com, soap/drama, and action/adventure, were from the USA though others came from Europe, Asia, and other African nations. In contrast, there were more global than local programs on TV3, Metro TV, and Crystal TV.

Globalization has a wide scope with dimensions of economics, politics, culture, and communication including the media in developing nations like Ghana. Hence, foreign culture in local traditional setting has been resisted, though some compromises have been made. The quest to maintain national identity through media policies coupled with the selection of specific foreign programs, in the face of globalization, yield complex interactions. Despite the vast areas and details covered in this media research, and benefits to the television industry, there are limitations of the lack of audience response to the programs on GTV and the other television stations in Ghana.

Study 1 used content analysis to examine the propensity, content, and article length of newspaper headlines and articles in California pertaining to majority and minority groups. Consistent with UK findings, majority headlines were associated with politics and identity adjectives. Minority headlines were linked with social issues and ethnicity-based adjectives. Contrary to UK findings, minority headlines were more frequent and majority articles were lengthier than minority articles. Study 2 considered headlines and articles in North and South Dakota. By and large, these results replicated UK findings. Alternate explanations derived from power and number definitions as well as social categories associated with majority and minority groups are advanced."

This grounded research led to a focus on the deontic nature of these statements, and also revealed a relative absence of condoling. Although condemnatory, statements did not specifically attribute the evil to particular people. Particularly mindful of Widdowsons distinction between analysis (text) and research (interpretation), the paper first identifies the textual features, but then hermeneutically interprets their meaning within a wider context of international political discourse. The paper concludes that the statements performed a positive epideictic purpose, although it tended to occlude the compassionate element of public grieving."

The speech was highly controversial within Canada and caused a rift in diplomatic relations between France and Ottawa. However, it did much to fuel Quebecs separatist movement and helped solidify Quebecs self-identification as a distinct society, unique from the so-called rest of Canada. Thirty years later the speech is still divisive; celebrated by French Canadians and vilified by their Anglo counterparts. In 1997 a statue was erected in de Gaulles honor, and the resulting media coverage reveals the continuing rift present between the two cultural groups. The vitriolic debate elucidates the symbolic role of history in media content, as well as the central myths that reinforce and construct the differing and often competing historical legacies and narratives of identity.

In this case, the media are the mode of negotiation of identity, offering a glimpse into identity negotiation: Canadian citizens arguing over who they are. The media provide a way for the different cultural groups to articulate their identity as well as their relationship to one another. Coverage of historical events also brings the topic to the attention of generations who were not present at the time they originally occurred, appealing to a collective consciousness and continuing the cultural divide."

In this paper, we focus on the preconditions of mediatization in the case of political negotiating institutions and present a model of influencing factors, which is dedicated as an empirical instrument for measuring the probability of mediatization effects. Our basic assumption is that the operational logic of negotiating institutions conflicts with media logic, what facilitates the observation of mediatization processes and its effects. Additionally, it is assumed that an intense media attention is in fact a necessary condition for mediatization of negotiating institutions, but not a sufficient one. The findings suggest that even for negotiating institutions which are in the central focus of media attention, no general mediatization can be proposed. In four case studies it is exemplarily shown, that mediatization effects depend fundamentally on the specific institutional preconditions and not only, what is oftentimes assumed, on media system itself."

Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is conceptualized as a developmental impairment of language processing, comprehension, and acquisition. We discuss potential reasons why media use of SLI children may differ from media use of their normal peers already at preschool age and present findings from a thematic diary study (N = 19 SLI children compared to N = 79 normal children, all aged 3 to 4 years). The data indicate that SLI children have a stronger preference for television than their normal peers and tend to avoid media situations that demand effective language processing, such as listening to audio tapes attentively or looking at picture books together with parents. Consequently, developmental impairments such as SLI are discussed as determinants of childrens media use, which holds implications for communication studies and intervention design."

Specifically, this study examines the interactive relationships between media and audiences. The concept of interactivity is reconceptualized as responsiveness to the user, audience information needs, and audience communication needs. In addition, how audiences influence the presentation of Web news content is examined. Twelve Chinese-language news Web sites were compared for the level of interactivity. An in-depth interview was conducted, and an online user survey was administered. Research findings show that the news Web sites present various levels of interactivity with an emphasis on meeting audience needs for information. Audience needs for communication were more likely to be fulfilled somewhere else. Survey results show that increased interactivity is desired by the audience only to a certain degree. Innovative use of the Weblogs was found. In sum, online news is presented in various formats to offer audiences updated information and possibly unique viewing experience."

It explores the current construction of the memory of Israeli journalism through an investigation of narratives dealing with the legacy of the radical and sensational weekly Haolam Hazeh (1937-1993). The article argues that such narratives transform the weekly from its earlier disputed public status during the state's formative era into a status of a worthy forefather of present critical Israeli journalism. Furthermore, the current construction of Haolam Hazeh's memory illuminates the ways by which Israeli journalists influence and position themselves within the debate over Israel's ""new historiography."""

The present study explores the relationships between reading Lad magazines and the endorsement of beliefs and attitudes that are consistent with their content as well as the way men view themselves sexually. Two surveys of male undergraduates (n = 91 and 68, respectively) are employed. The findings indicate a consistent relationship between reading Lad magazines and endorsement of permissive sexual attitudes independent of actual sexual behavior and status. Reading Lad magazines is also associated with expectations of greater sexual variety and a more aggressive sexual self-schema. Reading pornographic magazines is also found to be associated with permissive attitudes and expectations of greater sexual variety."

Results of the sample of studies collected to this point indicate that web-assisted instruction is not associated with significantly more learning than traditional instruction in these studies. On the other hand, student satisfaction is significantly lower for web-assisted than traditional instruction. The effect sizes for both variables are heterogeneous. This could reflect flaws in the data (e.g., invalid measures of the dependent variables) or the operation of a moderator variable."

In particular, it is concerned with how Latinidad is constructed by the U.S. Hispanic advertising industry and how women of Mexican origin make meaning of these media texts in relation to how Latinidad is used as a social/political practice in building solidarity across Latina/o communities. First, how is the Latina body discursively constructed in advertising? Secondly, how do women of Mexican origin, as part of the targeted group (Latinas) of these advertisements, interpret these texts? Specifically, how do these images tie into Latinidad translate into the meanings and practices of Latinidad in the everyday lives of these women? As such, this paper seeks to understand how Latinidad is constructed both from within and outside, that is by both Latina/os and by the advertising industry, using both textual analysis and ethnographic focus groups."

The time course of belief change provides information about dynamic aspects of the cognitive system. Using previous studies that obtained individual belief trajectories to observe the time course of belief change, this study developed a new framework for their analysis. This framework allows analyses of micro aspects of belief change during judgment. Hypotheses about the time course of belief change were developed and tested with McGreevy (1996) data, N = 102.
It was found that (1) while receiving a message recipients experience belief changes according to the sequence of information in the message (H1), valence and the amount of information in the message (H2), and weights of pieces of information in the message (H3). The study also found message type (univalent vs. mixed-valence) has an effect on the number of belief changes during the post-message phase (H6 and H7). This study tested oscillatory and damping patterns of belief trajectories (H4 and H5) but those patterns were not found. Theoretical implications and methodological significant are discussed."
2006-0875,Microprocesses of Preference Change in a Political Campaign: An Experimental Study,Cognitive/Emotional Processes in Persuasion,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,Microprocesses of Preference Change in a Political Campaign: An Experimental Study,Cognitive/Emotional Processes in Persuasion,"This study, a computer-based experiment, investigates the process of voters candidate preference change in a political campaign. To examine this process, the attitude-change trajectory in response to a series of attitudinally incongruent information about candidates was analyzed. Based on information integration theory (Anderson, 1971) and catastrophic model of attitude change (Fray, 1978; Latané & Nowak, 1994), a linear incremental change in candidate evaluation is predicted for voters with less interest in politics, while a catastrophic change is expected for voters with high political interest. In the study, participants were first given brief information about two fictitious political candidates who compete for public office in an election campaign and were then asked to vote for their preferred candidate. After participants indicated their preferred candidate, they were exposed to additional information about the candidates in the form of a series of newspaper-style articles. The information presented consisted of negative statements about participants preferred candidate or positive statements about the opponent. Participants attitudes toward the candidates were measured at multiple points in time during the campaign providing attitude change trajectories. The patterns of these attitude-change trajectories will be analyzed in hope to advance our understanding of how voters, exposed to counterattitudinal information, change their mind."

This gap is addressed by a content analysis of advertisements in magazines with the highest concentration of readership of the three largest minority groups and of highest selling consumer magazines for the population as a whole. Each ethnic group had its highest representation in ads in magazines popular with this group. However, levels of this representation differed significantly by targeted group, being highest for African-Americans and lowest for Asian-Americans."

One of the shortcomings in research is the lack of knowledge about media perception and the attitudes of ethnic minority audiences themselves towards the media. In Europe, in particular, little attention has been paid to media audience research within ethnic minority communities. This article examines the news consumption patterns and the news perception of ethnic minorities. We analysed the role ethnic identity can play in news consumption and perception as well. The main focus lies on the results of focus groups conducted between 2003 and 2005 with ethnic minority audiences (the Turkish and Moroccan communities) in Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium).
The research findings suggest that ethnic minorities have a diasporic mind for news consumption, which means that they are oriented towards national, as well as transnational news media. These news consumption patterns can be linked to the extent of ethnic identification."

Less research examines self-attributions in virtual teams, yet self-attributionsthe acknowledgement of personal responsibility or the deflection thereofholds potential to thwart or encourage learning, improvement, and liking. This study reviews recent findings on attributions in virtual groups, and propositions about the effects of distance versus collocation on members proclivity to blame others or themselves for their behavior. An experiment involved virtual groups whose members were geographically collocated, distributed, or mixed, working over two weeks using asynchronous computer-mediated communication. Results show systematic effects of distribution condition on participants attribution to the behavior of others for their own poor performance, and self-serving biases comparing such explanations for their own versus their partners behaviors. Moreover, an externally-imposed observational goal mitigated attributional bias among distributed members by raising awareness of the sociotechnical effects of communication medium among those for whom the goal was successfully induced."

They are both prevalent communication channels in everyday interpersonal relationships. This paper purports to claim that available mediated channels for interpersonal communication have to include the two different channeled medium, by identifying different uses of mobile call and SMS. This paper explores differences and relationships among media attributes (social presence and media richness), users perception of them (affinity and ease to use), motives to use, socio-economic variables, and media uses (preference for use). The results confirm that a mobile phone has two distinctive communication channels. Different uses of the two channels by gender also are identified. In addition, by finding high correlation between actual media use and factors that are not highly related with contents (economic factors) and innate attributes of each medium, the potential of habitual uses of new media also is identified."

Toward this end, we advance a conception of collective action as communicative in nature, and offer a two-dimensional model of collective action space, comprising dimensions for (a) the mode of interpersonal interaction and (b) the mode of engagement that shapes interaction. We illustrate the perspective by describing the location of a variety of contemporary collective action groups within it and by an explication of the space that reveals its utility for making sense of modern collective action efforts. Specifically, we apply the collective action space to illustrate the changing presence of collective action groups over time, deviations in collective action groups through changes in size, shape, and location, and variations in the experiences and motivations of people engaged in collective action efforts. Finally, we show how our communicative approach to collective action can integrate the insights of several theoretical traditions, including collective action theory, social capital theory, and aspects of organization theory."

Case studies were chosen that used models, metaphors, or games as tools to mediate or facilitate both communication and participation in the design process. Each case study approaches the topics of design, participation, and communication in similar ways, but for differing goals and outcomes. The five case studies are summarized and examined for their individual approaches to design, participation, and communication. Recommendations are offered for why and how an understanding of communication should be included in the critical study of participative design processes."

The findings indicate that, though the channels analyzed are associated with culture in their self-marketing and brand-name connotation, consumerism is consistently prioritized over culture, and the vast majority of programming focuses on North America while neglecting the rest of the world. Additionally, the tone of consumerism oriented program segments was significantly more positive than culture oriented program segments, leaving only a small portion of the programming examined with positive presentation of cultures beyond the U.S. Though public television provided more culture and less consumerism than commercial television, there was no significant difference in the amount of brand-name identification between the two."

The first conclusions present a framework based on the idea that we need to develop a model of journalism that:
1) exploits the cognitively and socially efficient formats of information search and distribution, that interactive and multimedia communication offers;
2) conceives the role of journalism not only as informational or partisan-based but also as resource-building;
3) integrates the gatekeeping role of journalists with the self-organizing abilities of the new network-based social networks"

Music Genre Preferences and School Grades of American Youth,Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,"American children listen to a variety of genres of music. While attention often focuses on issues of aggression and violence, there may be subtler effects. This study investigates possible relationships between genre preferences and school grades.
The study employs a representative sample of American seventhtwelfth graders. First, exploratory factor analyses are conducted using the different genres listened to by respondents. A structure of genre preferences is proposed, and differences between white and non-white respondents are explored. Using the groupings suggested by the factor analysis, regression analyses are used to investigate whether there are any associations between school grades obtained and genres.
Results indicate that different groups might have different interpretations of some genres asked about. In particular white and non-white students appear to have different interpretations of the term rhythm and blues or soul. A significant positive relationship is also found between listening to some uncontroversial tame music forms and high school grades, despite demographic controls. This relationship warrants further investigation."

Motivation and social context act as exogenous variables that influence types of cognitive processing in functional models of persuasion. Drawing on prior theories of need that propose hierarchical structures, a model is developed in which deep needs influence surface needs, with surface needs influencing goals for message processing. This model has implications for dual-process theories of attitude change. Attention and comprehension are added to the Elaboration Likelihood Model, allowing a fuller articulation of central and peripheral processes."

Parasocial interaction was strong, and related to fan communication and information motives, and to social presence. Demographic and Internet use variables were weakly related to motives, although education was negatively related to fan communication, and age was negatively related to pass time motives."

Adopting a framing approach, this paper uses ""Africa Unite,"" an event sponsored by the Bob Marley Foundation and the United Nations, as a case study. The results reveal that while African papers presented the event as the event organizers intended, ""Africa Unite"" was framed in the West as a musical celebration and not a call to arms for the African diaspora."

(Top Paper),"Globalization, Communication, Its Audiences and Discontents","This work explores how young South Asian Americans negotiate cultural identity through mediated global flows. It looks at the hybridization of South Asian and American cultural forms, including music, television, and language. This study introduces readers to MTV Desi, a newly created MTV channel that targets young South Asian Americans. The development of MTV Desi raises further questions related to diaspora, globalization, ethnicity and media representation. This work seeks to bridge the chasm between theory and research by treating globalization as a mediated cultural experience that manifests in the diaspora. Using in-depth qualitative interviews with a carefully selected sample of young South Asian Americans, readers discover concrete examples of the audiences experiences with hybridization and ways media affect discourse on race and ethnicity. Through selected interview excerpts, respondents express their feelings of misrepresentation in television and film. An important feature of this work is its analysis of the word desi among various South Asian groups. It charts new territory in media studies by examining the cross-cultural appropriation of language. Reinvigorating a stale debate on MTV, this study sees MTV Desi as an intermediary of global culture that continues the process of reflecting and reinforcing the ethnic hybridity characteristic of transnational television networks. This study finds that MTV Desi constitutes a reverse flow of globalization as experienced by young South Asian Americans."

Reducing the Democratic Imaginary?,Game Studies Interactive Paper Session,"The democratic potential of ICTs has been both celebrated and criticised. This article wants to take these analyses one step further, by analysing the power relations in two specific virtual communities, both Multi User Domains/Dungeons (MUDs). The framework for analysis is provided by the writings of Giddens and Foucault, which allows us to distinguish between the generative and restrictive aspects of power, without disregarding their dialectical nature and, in combination with the induced resistance, their productive capacities. Using participant observation, the focus is placed on the power relations between 'ordinary' players (mortals) and the 'owners' (immortals annex implementators) of the two MUDs. Although some room exists for negotiation, solidarity, collaboration and co-deciding, the overall effect produced by the dialectics of control approximates a quasi-authoritarian situation. The only room for real resistance that remains open to the mortals is to simply leave the MUD. Despite the specific playfulness of the environment and the pleasure it does generate to both mortals and immortals, its troublesome negation of democracy is difficult to combine with the concern for the democratisation of society at all levels and with the blind celebration of the democratic potential of ICTs."

To explain how these three discrete dimensions of trust influence open communication intentions, two models were constructed from previous studies on trust. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results show that the model in which the effects of institution-level trust are mediated by the influence of the two kinds of interpersonal trusts better explains intentions to communicate openly, rather than the one in which the three kinds of trust were predicted to have direct and simultaneous effects on the officials open communication intentions."

It was hypothesized that self-construals, and particularly the fit between the sojourners profile and normative tendency of the host society, would predict better adaptation. Moreover, it was hypothesized that intercultural contact would also contribute to adaptation, but this link would be intercultural contact would be mediated by English language self-confidence. A multi-national group of international students originating from societies with a collectivist cultural orientation (N =81) registered at a Canadian university was compared with group of Canadian-born students (N = 135). Hierarchical regression showed that more independent international students experienced higher self-esteem and fewer sociocultural difficulties, but the discrepancy between the students self-construal and the mean score of the Canadian sample did not. Structural equation modeling revealed two pathways of cross-cultural adaptation in which independent self-construal predicted psychological adjustment, and language self-confidence mediated the relations between host cultural contact and psychological adjustment and socioultural difficulty."

Qualitative and quantitative analysis of 23 cognitive walk-through indicates that there was a gap between theoretically embracing a devices multi-functionality and actually using its capabilities. Subjects liked the plurifocal device, but could not always take advantage of its range of features. Subjects expressed a need for more physical controls and hardwired buttons. This response emerged not only because the users had formed particular mental models and associated behaviors from their past use of other devices. They also expressed a positive preference for immediate access and use of the controls within a multi-tasking environment. This suggests that as mobile computing becomes more prevalent, physical controls become more, not less important."

Participants (176) were randomly assigned to watch one of three versions of CSI: Miami. The conditions were a control (the complete), a logic-disturbance condition (the program with scenes removed to interfere with the logic of the plot), and an emotional-disturbance condition (the program with scenes removed to interfere with emotional content of the story). Advertisements were removed from all programs. After viewing, participants completed a thought listing procedure and scales measuring transportation and telepresence.
Data indicate that disturbing the logical or emotional aspects of the plot had no negative effect on transportation or telepresence. The frequency of thoughts that were critical of the programs narrative were negatively related to transportation and telepresence. Emotional thoughts about the narrative were positively related to transportation and telepresence."

Abstract


The influence of two television dramas on support for public policy issues is investigated, along with the influence of several audience activities, including active processing and discussion variables. A sample of 127 college students showed support for persuasive impact of televised content about public support to curb racial profiling, with discussion about the issue and immersion into the narrative in the case of one of the televised dramas demonstrating a lasting impact over time. Other audience activities and characteristics are examined, with implications for narrative persuasion research."

This discussion is extremely relevant in the cases of small countries living under the custody of globalization, primarily Americanization. While most noticeable scholars who write about national identity focus on high and official culture, we suggest looking at one of the most prominent products of popular culture  advertisement. This study utilizes qualitative analysis, based on a semiotic interpretation using 589 Israeli advertisements. Looking at two broad categories: (a) national symbols and (b) spatial identity, we found a new real estate discourse, in which Americanicity is an integral part of the neo-liberal discourse in Israeli society. In other words, the motherland turns into real estate."

The findings suggest that the relationship between source stance and references to national interest in the stories was decided by the central interest of the respective country in the bilateral relations, and how the issues involving national interest were presented by the newspapers. Whereas U.S. and Chinese officials were found to be the dominant sources in the coverage of U.S.-China relations, dominant sources stance toward U.S.-China relations was not found to be associated with portrayal direction of the stories, nor with bias of the news coverage in either newspaper. The deviation between dominant source stance and the portrayal direction and bias of coverage may suggest that reporters take on the issues involved play an important role in shaping the coverage of U.S.-China relations."

Evening news report from ABC, CBS, and NBC news from 1981 to 2003 were studied. News coverage of GM food was very sporadic over the period studied except for the infrequent crisis event. CBS news accounted for more stories than the two other networks combined. Explanations for this unusual finding are sought, especially through interviews with the CBS personnel responsible for many of the stories. The study also examines the tone (positive or negative toward GM food) of the on-air sources used in the networks' reports. Here, little difference was found."

Selecting all articles over 250 words on the topic between 01/01/01 and 10/31/03 (325 articles). city characteristics were compared systematically with a composite measure of coverage, combining article prominence and article direction, to calculate a media vector, ranging from +.330 to -0.146.
Using Pearson correlations, regression and factor analysis, findings confirmed the importance of both stakeholders and privilege. Pearson correlations revealed a positive relationship between crime rate and affirmative action in higher education(r=.552, p=.007), yet the higher the percentage of citizens ages 18-25, presumably young and socially liberal, the less favorable the coverage of affirmative action (r= -.484, p= .013). A violated buffer hypothesis were also confirmed, contrary to original predictions. The greater the proportion of citizens in a city who are more privileged educationally, economically and professionally, the less favorable the coverage of affirmative action (respectively, r=-.409, p=.037; r=-.393, p=.043; r=-.381, p=.049), suggesting that affirmative action may represent a threat to a cherished way of life.
Subsequent factor analysis and regression of the factors further confirmed the violated buffer hypothesis, predicting that higher percentages of privileged groups and Hispanics corresponded with reporting unfavorable to social changes, in this case unfavorable to affirmative action. This factor/cluster accounted for 60 percent of the variance. Regional average media vectors were compared and found aligned with regional public opinion polling results."

Selecting all 400+ word articles on the topic between 01/2000 and 12/2004 (331 articles) city characteristics were compared systematically with a composite measure of coverage, combining article prominence and direction to calculate a Media Vector for each newspaper, ranging from +.40 to -.23.

Pearson correlations and regression analysis yielded a curious dichotomy. Favorable coverage of GM Foods was strongly connected to measures of vulnerability: percent below poverty level (r=.624; p=.002) and access to healthcare (percent municipal budget devoted to healthcare, r=.562; p=.005). Yet coverage of GM foods was also negatively linked to measures of privilege (percent college educated, r = -.426, p = .031; percent professionals, r = -.379, p = .05), supporting a violated buffer hypothesis: Higher proportions of privileged groups in communities are connected with unfavorable coverage of biological threats or threats to a cherished way of life. Regression analysis confirmed that vulnerability measures (poverty level and healthcare budget) accounted for 66 percent of the variance. Factor analysis of city characteristics and factor regression yielded two significant factors regarding GM Food coverage. Vulnerability (unemployment level) accounted for 40+ percent of the variance; adding number of farms yielded 50 percent. Average regional Media Vectors and regional public opinion were mostly aligned, with both newspapers and public opinion most opposed to GM Foods in the Northeast, both more favorable to GM Foods in the South and Midwest."

Will negative news, e.g. relentless attacks on political authorities, result in political cynicism (Cappella and Jamieson 1997; Patterson 1993) or in a stimulation effect (Lau and Pomper 2001; Newton 1999)? By and large the media may stimulate political participation, but it is less clear when negative news will excavate this effect. Negative news may not only have short term behavioral effects, but also effects on underlying attitudes such as trust in politicians, which may produce their sleeper effect on political behavior only in the long run.
This article addresses two related research questions. Will negative news discourage trust in political leaders? Will trust have a sleeper effect for future party choice and future turnout within the months to come? The 2002 Dutch election campaign, being an unprecedented negative campaign as compared to other Dutch campaigns, provides a good case to investigate these questions. On the basis of a bi-weekly seven wave panel survey study and a daily content analysis of television news and newspapers, negative news was found to have a significant effect on trust in party leaders, in addition to prior vote preference and education. The distrust in party leaders also had a significant sleeper effect in the long run on turnout and on the actual vote in addition to previous intentions. In general, these findings support the malaise theory."

Specifically, the research examines Filipinas' editorial mission from the perspective of its content producers /message gatekeepers.
This paper asks: in the daily mediated communications of Filipino-Americans, what factors condition and constrain, as well as enable and promote ethnic media involvement in the production of representations that speak to the lived experiences of this Asian diasporic group? What is Filipinas doing differently that explains its viability as an ethnic mass medium?
Preliminary findings indicate that this minority publication fosters both ethnic identity confirmation and realignment. Its 13-year survival record implies some success in negotiating its media space but is still faced with several challenges. It appears that Filipinas has to constantly assert its right to be recognized within the multidimensional context of differentiated citizenship.

However, very little empirical research has been undertaken to further our understanding of exactly why their role is important, in what ways it is significant, and to what effect(s). The study proposed is a multidisciplinary effort, rooted in communication and peace studies research that intends to develop a theory-driven analytical framework that would enable the study of the often-invisible infrastructure that sustains peace processes. This infrastructure is conceived as a web of communication networks consisting of and, in many ways, generated by middle level officials. We argue that a networks-centered approach is particularly useful in this case, exactly because the landscape of actors and the relationships between them emerge as a result of the peace-building process and are not necessarily pre-defined by formal, higher level authorities (i.e., governmental, opposition leadership). Moreover, we seek to understand how values, seen a key attributes of the actors under study, affect and are affected by the peace-building process. Theoretical contributions and a methodological toolkit that (i) enables evaluation of peace building efforts and (ii) development of communication infrastructures that can sustain such efforts are our intended outcomes. We set out to investigate three types of research questions: (a) questions focused on communication patterns, (b) questions centered on the role of values, and (c) questions pertaining to particular environmental (contextual) differences (i.e., Colombia vis-à-vis Northern Ireland)."

However, much is left unanswered. I argue that communication research and a communication ecology approach, in particular, has much to contribute to this vein of inquiry, as it allows for better, in some cases, and at least partial, in other cases, answers to: (a) how particular social processes work and lead to outcomes observed at the community level and (b) how space and place becomes inscribed with meaning; more importantly, however, (c) a communication approach allows us to move from a paradigm of neighborhood effects to one of community change."

This study examined whether cable systems with a larger network would provide more benefits to subscribers than cable systems of smaller size. Two-stage least squares and logistic regression analyses, using the data from the 2004 Television & Cable Fact Book and the U.S. Government Census showed the existence of indirect, positive network effects for cable television networks of significant size. Specifically, the regression analysis indicated that cable systems that have a larger network are likely to have a greater possibility for two-way network capability and a more channel capacity for basic-tier cable service."
2006-0927,Networking by Metaphors,Theorizing Mediated Spaces,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Networking by Metaphors,Theorizing Mediated Spaces,"Katherine Hayles (2002) noted that the symbol-processing machines we call computers are more and more hooked into networks which connects to apparatus that can actually do things in the world. Digital networks thus can be seen as a specific assemblage of material and semiotic processes. In this situation tools become signs, and signs become tools. How does this networked tool-sign oscillation come about? In this paper it is argued that this is mediated by metaphors, on several levels.
Lakoff and Johnson's theory of conceptual metaphor (1980) is a good starting point, but has its limits. It will be shown that this theory provides no account of metaphorical transmediation processes outside the human mind. I propose an extension of this theory with Hayles' concept of 'material metaphor', and recent critiques in terms of 'discourse metaphors'. My claim is that these notions enable an ontological and epistemological clarification of daily Internet practices."

As the ability to access information by traveling to various sites, there is consensus that this ability increases at an enormous rate. Yet, it is not altogether clear what it is that is growing. To my knowledge, nobody has attempted to provide quantitative measures of the size of cyberspace, not even in approximations.

I year or so ago, I developed a conceptual foundation for such estimates. With new data on storage media and network capacities that I want to refine these measures. They shed new light on how far the ongoing information revolution can go.

This is exiting stuff. But I want to introduce a few useful concepts. One is the distinction between committed and uncommitted cyberspace. Software occupies space and so do intercomputational networks. I want to explore the spaces that different kinds of networks occupy and how much they leave to be utilized for communication. Where links can be chosen freely, which is characteristic of the Internet and interactive media, space is freed. The existence of large uncommitted spaces makes conventional research of cyberspace difficult and explains why a networked society is so hard to understand.

Finally, I want to address four individual issues: access, capacities to utilize cyberspace, how uncommitted spaces can provide culturally committable information or encourage new uses, meanings, and technological developments, and finally, intelligence amplification: browsers, search engines, decision aids, which can bring serendipitous information into the lives of individuals."
2006-0929,Networks in the Management of Heritage Tourism,dentification Processes in Organizational Networks,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Networks in the Management of Heritage Tourism,Identification Processes in Organizational Networks,"This paper is concerned with the study of heritage tourism networks. This is a case analysis that wishes to give a contribution to our understanding on the formation, evolution and performance of business networks and network-based markets.
We offer our contribution to building understanding on these critical questions, studying the networks emerged in the heritage tourism, and in particular the networks formed under the general formula named albergo diffuso (distributed hospitality) in Italy. For this study we have applied the IMP conceptual approach to business markets, and the ARA methodology for the analysis of network relationships, with a comparative approach.
We can define the networks structures (boundaries and organization) that we have studied as complex and evolutionary; they have emerged as complex socio-cognitively constructed outcomes of social adaptations,. The networks, in fact, are not built out of abstract, static and overimposed identities of the local communities, but - instead  they have emerged from the interlinks between the local heritage and a vision of the territory that the network initiator proposes to the local and non-local communities. The different openness of the networks and their translocalism (that is culturally driven) seem to make the biggest difference in the processes and the outcomes. Managerial implications are discussed."

The focus of Study 1 was to examine perceived differences in media use for self and others for a variety of media. The third-person effects were found for all media except television, which contradicts prior research. To address this anomaly, Study 2 compared television use with newspaper use and introduced two different manipulations (motivational demand and self-monitoring). Those who monitored their media activity for one week showed no third-person biases for television, compared to a control group which showed findings consistent with past research. This suggests a cognitive, rather than a motivational origin of the effect. The same was not true for newspaper use, however. We also addressed a number of applied issues, such as the added benefits of maintaining a diary and expected degree of participant compliance in maintaining a media diary."

Conscious of his race, Eminem stresses that he is not to be placed in the white rapper category but should be respected for his skills. Despite this yearning, his emergence in a musical genre linked to blackness furnishes a point of entry to outline strategies white MCs use to construct a non-racist form of whiteness. Popular culture and media are implicated in the social construction of race by providing texts reinforcing and maintaining essentialized notions of blackness and whiteness. Furthermore, the power and privilege of whiteness resides in its non-naming and in response, hip-hop clearly marks whiteness, and provides a space to critically interrogate and question its normalcy. With relatively few discussions pertaining to white participation in rap music this paper links the struggle for authenticity in the hip-hop world to the social constructions of race, and specifically whiteness."
2006-0932,New Communication Technologies and the Mediation of Transnational Relationships,"Networking New Media in Studies of Ethnicity, Race and National Identity",Ethnicity and Race in Communication,,,Works in Progress,New Communication Technologies and the Mediation of Transnational Relationships,"Networking New Media in Studies of Ethnicity, Race and National Identity","Studies on new media and transnationalism have generally oscillated between two assumptions: on the one hand, there are theories that assume the powerful role of the media in shaping identities; on the other hand, there are theories which argue for the resilience of national, ethnic, or local cultures and the emergence of phenomena such as long distance nationalism (Anderson 2000). This paper takes a different approach by attempting to investigate the impact of communication technologies on the private lives of transnational families. The paper observes how new communications technologies, particularly the internet and mobile phones, enable people to move across transnational spaces thus transforming their experience of home and often their primary relationships. However, this enabling dimension of the new media, should not necessarily be interpreted through the lens of ethnicity. For example, the paper centres on the impact of ICTs on immigrants primary relationships, that is on parent-child and partner relationships that have been split as a consequence of migration. The paper, drawing on empirical work among Filipinos in the UK discusses the ways in which long distance relationships of love and care are maintained and transformed as a consequence of their mediation. In so doing the paper seeks to highlight another  hitherto neglected  dimension of the experience of mediated transnationalism as embedded in intimate everyday life practices."

This article aims to investigate the impact of new media on the discourse structure of online sales promotion letters from the perspective of language as social interaction. It is argued that an integrated theoretical approach of social discourse analysis and genre analysis is needed to explore how meaning is created in text, context, and interface of new media communication. It is believed that the impact will stand out more prominently by comparing online sales promotion letters with printed ones. A corpus of 40 sales promotion letters (20 online letters and 20 printed letters) randomly selected from a database of 7,210 sales promotion letters collected from 36 categories of informants in Hong Kong over a six-month period was formed for detailed analysis. Similarities and differences were found in discourse structure and organization of the two sets of letters. It was shown that given a similarity in communicative purposes of these letters, there was still room for creativity in discourse strategies due to a difference in medium. It was found, for example, that the online sales promotion letters were more user-driven and action-oriented. New media are playing an important role in the overall interactional or social strategy of credibility enhancement and persuasion in the context of sales promotion."

The predicting power of social characteristics on new media use behavior is also discussed.

Findings highlights that active online political information seeking behaviors, which can be expected by the publics education and income, raised the likelihood of voting. General Internet exposure, which can be reduced by age and gender, however, could not increase the turnout as expected. Among social characteristics indicators, education accounted for the most, whereas gender did not matter in the 2000 presidential election. New media usage is not able to explain more about the voter turnout than the influence exerted by peoples social characteristics."
2006-0952,New Perspectives on Group Libel: Applying Social Capital Theory and Class Action Procedure,Communication Law and Policy Interactive Paper Session,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,New Perspectives on Group Libel: Applying Social Capital Theory and Class Action Procedure,Communication Law and Policy Interactive Paper Session,"Members of a group should be allowed to maintain a libel suit regardless of the groups size. Under the current libel law, a group has no reputation and group members cannot maintain a libel suit if its size is over 25 persons. But according to social capital theory, a group does have a reputation, which is a kind of social capital. If a groups reputation is defamed, its members reputations are also derogated, and vice versa. Therefore, both the group as a whole and its individual members actively seek to enhance their reputations.
The logic of dilution, which holds that no one member suffers personal injury if the group is sufficiently large enough, is the theoretical background of the 25person rule. Yet this is also unreasonable because damage does not entirely disappear even in the case of larger groups.
Should the courts reject the 25-person rule, class action will be an effective legal remedy for a defamed group or its members. Class-action suits are the most effective way of compensating a large group of people for relatively minor individual damage."
2006-0953,News and Ethnic Prejudice: Threat Framing of Immigrants and its Impact on Anti-Immigration Sentiments,The Role of the Media in Shaping National Identity,Political Communication,,,Paper,News and Ethnic Prejudice: Threat Framing of Immigrants and its Impact on Anti-Immigration Sentiments,The Role of the Media in Shaping National Identity,"A growing amount of scholarly literature identifies anti-immigration attitudes as an essential political attitude influencing party support, especially for extreme-right parties, support for European integration and enlargement, and for welfare and immigration policy. Studies on the contribution of news media content to the formation of these attitudes are scarce. In the present study, based on theoretical considerations relating to sterotypization and social identity theory, it is expected that either exposure to differentiating cues concerning immigrant groups or to news framed in terms cultural, security, or economic threats affects anti-immigration attitudes. Survey data collected among a representative sample of the Dutch population is directly integrated with data from a media content analysis of the main Dutch television newscasts and national newspapers prior to the survey. It is shown that both exposure to a high frequency of immigrant/immigration stories and exposure to particularly cultural threat frames are positive predictors for anti-immigrant attitudes. This study improves upon previous research designs by controlling for a broad array of established explanatory factors and by taking actual news content into account. The results are discussed in the context of growing hostility towards ethnic minorities and the emergence of extreme right parties in the Netherlands."
2006-0954,News and Public Affairs Networks of PBS Member Stations: A Network Analysis of Stations Programming Exchange,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,News and Public Affairs Networks of PBS Member Stations: A Network Analysis of Stations Programming Exchange,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"The public television system in America is a group of 163 actively programming stations that serve the interests and needs of their local communities. Distinctive to the American public television system is its historical and current practice of exchanging programming produced by one public television station to others within the system through its national programming distribution service. This arrangement of program exchange among the stations allows them to be studied as a network of producing and programming stations. Because of the assumed importance of news and public affairs programming to a healthy and functioning democracy, attention to journalistic programming exchanges is of particular importance when studying the network. Guided by the theoretical frameworks of the marketplace of ideas, transaction cost economics, and social exchange, and utilizing network analysis, this paper considers how structurally diverse the news and public affairs schedule is for individual stations and the PBS network at large. Initial findings indicate a range of diversity at the local level and a concentration of news and public affairs production at the network level, suggesting a tension between the diversity principle of the marketplace of ideas and minimizing transaction costs."

The who, what, and why emphasized in each paper were significantly different. These differences lend credence to the idea that frames are ideologically based and that the war was seen differently in different parts of the world."

ELNs are experiencing change around the world as globalization impacts all news media. This paper provides an overview of three leading Chinese English-language dailies---the China Daily, the Shanghai Daily, and the South China Morning Post. Qualitative content analyses were conducted as well as in-depth interviews with editors from each of the publications. These newspapers are in a transitional era and are benefiting from growth and expansion of content as they continue to serve their traditional business, diplomatic, and educational markets while seeking new groups of readers both in print and online. They are also, this paper shows, seeking to develop new ways to distribute information gathered through the Internet with Web sites and other new technological services."

A systematic content analysis of news coverage from the crucial period 1988 to 1992, when the cancer incidence and mortality rates began to decrease significantly, indicates that more than half of the coverage highlighted the individual burden of cancer rather than the social or epidemiological burden, regardless of changes in epidemiological trends. Rather, the types of burdens appear significantly associated with the news values or theme frames. Individual burdens are represented through personal experiences, especially narratives detailing cause or treatment, while the social burdens are associated generally with the news themes relating to cancer policy. Also, the individual burdens typically relate to soft news values, while the social burdens most often reflected hard news values. The news frames of cancer burdens may be associated more with journalistic routines and readers news values than with factual representations of epidemiological phenomena and scientific information. It may be here that debatable questions concerning the news frames of health-related messages are identified."

Dominant news frames were identified in two mainstream newspapers and one reform newspaper in Korea to examine the process of the formation of a dominant interpretation of the controversial gender issue. In the two mainstream newspapers, the dominant news frame was economic loss: the law was framed as threatening the livelihood of people who were engaged in the sex industry and related businesses, and as a threat to the national economy in a time of economic stagnation. In contrast, the reform newspaper framed the law as protection for human rights, but this frame was marginalized in the two mainstream newspapers."

this research seeks to explore medias healthier role in reporting international dialogues in the
shifting triangle relationship. By clarifying a misconception in extant research that biases are
unavoidable in framing, the article suggests that news framing can be both objective and advocacy
towards an event. A summary of previous works on triangle relationship interprets how dialogues
can happen in the changing international environment, which provides the basis for definition of
objective and advocacy reporting of international dialogue. A comparison of BBC Onlines
news reports and audiences comments on Tony Blairs visit to Libya is conducted within this
research frame. It is found out that audiences are capable to establish a more objective and
advocacy frame than the media. On the macro level, while BBC Online draws diverse key words
into reports, the frame is inherently biased and misleading for many key words revolve around the
same theme. However, from the micro perspective, the narrative style is open and relatively
objective, inviting the audience to interpret the issue independently without being much influenced
by media biases. Suggestions are offered for media to play a healthier role in international dialogue
in the shifting triangle relationship."

Study one consisted of an online survey constructed to assess the connection between perceived credibility of news media and scores on a modern racism scale. After controlling for a number of factors the results suggest that those who view nontraditional Internet news sources as being credible also score highly on a modern racism scale. In study two, a survey of Los Angeles county adult residents was undertaken to determine whether exposure to Internet news was linked to fear of crime and notions of minority group criminality. After controlling for a number of demographic variables, results revealed Internet news exposure was positively related to concern about crime and percentage ratings of both Black and Latino criminality. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed, with a focus on the Internet as a safe haven for divergent, even racist, beliefs."

Through this examination, we argue that it is impossible to consider problems of journalisms role in society in a vacuum. Instead, we must assess the material conditions under which newsworkers labor, and the journalistic practices that arise from, and interact with these conditions. We show that Sierra Leone has a tradition of a lively critical press. However, conditions for journalism are difficult in one of the worlds least developed nations. Problems include prohibitive legislation, poor infrastructure, difficulties in distribution, lack of literacy, lack of journalistic skills, a minuscule revenue base in terms of advertising and sales, and a lack of electricity, basic materials, technologies and resources. These constraints are making lives difficult for print journalists, and adversely affecting the quality of their work. The lack of financial resources engenders the unethical practice of coasting, or blackmailing, among journalists. However, these same resource problems haunt every aspect of society, including government, education, business and civil society. As such, journalism cannot be viewed in isolation from other social institutions. And despite all constraints, journalism in Sierra Leone is emerging as a watchdog on concentrations of power."

It examines how these newspapers dealt with educational issues, especially in terms of positive vs. negative reporting, functional vs. structural vs. philosophical educational reform, and various news values that reflect characteristics of deviance, objectivity, diversity, and investigation. Our analysis shows that Korean dailies' coverage of university news was dull, superficial, one-sided, inaccurate, and less investigative. Nevertheless, the gaps of educational coverage between these newspapers were not too wide to be bridged. Based on these findings, we pinpoint typical characteristics of news values and suggest new ways of covering the educational beat in a newly democratized country."

This paper examines the discourse of the future in order to identify its extent and different genres.
The research examined 1,745 headlines in Israeli newspapers over a period of 18 years (1985-2003) and found that most (60 percent to 70 percent) of the main headlines deal also with future and not just past events.
The qualitative analysis suggests four types of discourse of the future genres: Predictable Future, Informed Assessment, Speculative Assessment and Conjectured Future (uncertain future time).
The discussion argues that the discourse of the future carries political importance because it provides fertile ground for media spin-doctors, for releasing trial balloons, presenting an image of activity, covering-up embarrassing mishaps, magnifying threats, creating solidarity, and justifying acts of government."

Content analysis provides a longitudinal view of the nature of news coverage of presidential primary campaigns. Horse race coverage was most common topic (40%), followed by discussions of the candidates' character (17%), policy positions (12%), and voters (4%; scandal and election information were less than 1% of coverage). The proportion of horse race coverage declined over time while discussion of character increased. Horse race coverage was comprised of campaign strategy (48%), campaign events (19%), predictions (8%), endorsements (7%), outcomes (7%), and polls (6%; other horse race topics accounted for less than 5% each). The percent of strategy and endorsements decreased over time while use of polls increased. The tone of primary coverage was more negative (50%) than positive (46%; defense was discussed in 4% of the news statements). Reporters were the most common source of statements (54%), followed by candidates (25%), supporters (12%), and others (8%). New York Times primary campaign coverage emphasized character more, and policy less, than candidates' television spots, debates, or direct mail brochures. This news coverage was more negative than candidates' television spots, debates, or direct mail brochures."

Three news magazines were also sampled. Of interest was media coverage of tobacco-control policies and tobacco prevention information. Results indicate that tobacco coverage was modest over the two-year period. Only nine TV stories, 18 news magazine stories, and 329 daily newspaper stories were found.
Results for the newspaper data include the following: (1) government frames predominated; (2) government action and negative health effects topics tended not to occur together in stories; (3) aside from mentioning negative health consequences in general, stories contained little prevention information; (5) opinion news items tended to favor tobacco-control policies, while news and feature stories were evenly split between positively and negatively valenced stories; and (6) tobacco coverage in the Southeast did not differ from the rest of the country."

The ComAbstracts database, spanning 90 years and more than 46,000 publications, provides significantly greater breadth and depth than previously available data sources. The strategy for sampling scholars included in this study also differs from prior work by limiting the sample to scholars affiliated with the communication field through membership in one of its primary professional societies. For purposes of studying historical change in productivity, the sample of scholars was divided into six cohorts at different points in their careers to discover norms for publication productivity at milestone intervals following career onset, defined as the date of award of the Ph.D. or an equivalent terminal degree. Among other findings, results suggest (a) that rates of contribution of single authored articles have fallen significantly over the years without compensating increases in the number of multi-authored publications, (b) that an early high rate of publication productivity is highly predictive of a sustained high rate, and (c) that more than one third of the membership of the scholars sample had not contributed any articles to the field's literature. As well, a metric for determining exceptionally high and low productivity rates by career stage is suggested and illustrated, revealing a way of identifying top-tier and sub-normal productivity adjusted for years in career."

Fictional television, on the other hand, has been assumed to have limited consequences for real world policy views. Despite the fact hat citizens spend far more time watching fictional television than watching nonfiction programming, it has been assumed that viewers discount the political implications of fictional programming because they are aware that the content is not real, and thus not relevant to real world policy decisions. Our study re-examines this assumption using an experimental design in which subjects in are randomly assigned to watch episodes of the popular crime drama Law & Order with contrary implications about the fallibility of the criminal justice system. We examine the impact of these storylines on attitudes toward participants in the criminal justice system, perceptions of its fairness, and opinions on several crime-relevant policies. Results are discussed in light of the common assumption that viewers do not integrate fictional programming with beliefs about the real world. We assess support for this hypothesis and its implications in a time when many fictional storylines are ripped from the headlines."

Furthermore, nurse-patient communication related directly to the degree of perceived need of the nurse to acquire more knowledge about nutrition. The involvement construct applied in a social learning context offers a new perspective regarding personal gain and perceived self-efficacy as a possible continuum that enhances social learning, with emphasis on model-dependent relevance of publicized messages. Results indicate that those seeking to reach patients through oncology nurses with effective messages regarding nutrition should emphasize the value of nurse-patient communication as well as the professional and personal benefits of nutritional knowledge for nurses themselves."

The aims of the study were to determine (a) the development of purchase-related interactions (i.e., childrens purchase influence attempts, their coercive behavior, and parent-initiated interactions), and (b) the relative effects of different socialization variables (e.g., television viewing, family communication) on these interactions. Results show that the development of childrens purchase influence attempts and their coercive behavior followed an inverted-U pattern. Purchase influence attempts increased until the age of 6, and started to decline after the age of 8. Children's coercive behavior reached a peak between the ages of 3 and 5. With increasing age, children were more likely to be involved in the purchase decision making process, and parent-child interactions more often resulted in a product purchase. Finally, children's television viewing was the most important predictor of their purchase influence attempts."

Previous research suggests that the often-overlooked formal and implicit characteristics of newscasts may be systematically related to culture-specific characteristics. Investigating these characteristics by means of a frame-by-frame content analysis is identified as a particularly promising methodological approach. To examine the relationship between culture and selected formal characteristics of newscasts, we present a study that compares material from the USA, the Arab world, and Germany. Results indicate that there are many significant differences, some of which are in line with underlying dimensions of culture. Specifically, we argue that the number of people presented as well as the context in which they are presented can be interpreted as an indicator of collectivism. The drawn conclusions underline the validity of the chosen methodological approach, but also demonstrate the need for more comprehensive and theory-driven category schemes."
2006-0972,Oil and Gas as Natural Riches or Environmental Problems: Framing Contests in Public Relations,Public Relations and Framing,Public Relations,,,Paper,Oil and Gas as Natural Riches or Environmental Problems: Framing Contests in Public Relations,Public Relations and Framing,"Public relations practitioners use frames as strategic tools to further the interest of their organizations. A frame promotes a certain definition and perspective at the expense of competing ways of understanding a particular issue. However, researchers seldom analyze the dynamic contests between organizational sponsors different frames and their reception in the media and the political arena. In this study, it is focused on a particular case where the Norwegian petroleum industry argued for access to new areas. The environmental organizations, on the other hand, argued that the potential for an environmental catastrophe was too large to allow drilling in these areas and that Norway also was obliged to cut back on CO2-emissions. The case study illustrates a potential problem for public relations practitioners and the public alike, as the media largely ignored the frames of the organizational actors. Instead a typical media frame, the horse race frame, was used, a frame that leaves the readers uninformed about the issue in question."

NBC made a number of adjustments to the promotion practices during previous Olympic coverage and September 2004 ratings results indicated that many programs received a substantial bump following the Olympic broadcasts. Surprisingly, every new series increased ratings over their time slot in the previous year and three of the five new shows increased by more than 2 ratings pointsas did more than one-third of returning shows. Only one primetime program promoted during the Olympics suffered a significant ratings drop. NBCs focus on promotion during the Olympic broadcasts and strategic decision to move several premiere episodes earlier in September was justified."

While the study finds that nearly all of the top corporations are using some aspects of an online media room, it concludes that most are not using the Internet to its fullest potential in establishing dialogue with the media."

Finally, it analyzed the nature of online protest from a communication perspective. In conclusion, this study argued that the First Amendment issues about online protest should be reconsidered from the perspective of speech as well as content and effects"
2006-0976,Online Social Support and Intercultural Adaptation,Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Intercultural Encounters,Intercultural & Development Communication,,Intercultural Communication,Paper,Online Social Support and Intercultural Adaptation,Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Intercultural Encounters,"The present study examines the relationship between social support received online and intercultural adaptation of immigrants. A distinction is drawn between psychological and socio-cultural adaptation, where the latter aspect is further categorized, through factor analysis, as social adaptation, physical adaptation, and cultural adaptation. Online social support is classified into four types, namely, informational, emotional, tangible, and companionship support.
Data are collected from a telephone survey conducted among Chinese immigrants in Singapore. The results of data analysis reveal that online support has positive effect on intercultural adaptation in both socio-cultural and psychological aspects. Apparently the process of sociocultural adaptation is affected by online support, especially the social dimension of the three subscales. Among the individual types of support, informational support demonstrates a prominent effect on the adaptation of the immigrants, and its impact is seen across all dimensions of sociocultural adaptation. Interestingly, although instrumental in nature, informational support and tangible support are found to be closely associated with psychological adaptation, as well as with sociocultural adaptation that can be anticipated.
This study suggests that online support is an efficient and valuable supplement to traditional social support for immigrants, especially when they are in the transition period and lack of real life social network."

With the increase in the availability and popularity of internet, the possibility has arisen to join online support groups. Various authors have raised potential disadvantages of these groups, such as the lack of control of the quality of the information that is exchanged and the concern that the exchange within the group might include socially inappropriate remarks. In this study we explored to what extent these potential disadvantages actually occur. In addition, we explored who uses Dutch online support groups and what is exchanged by the participants. By means of content analysis we analyzed a random sample of 1500 messages from publicly available online support groups for patients with breast cancer, arthritis and fibromyalgia. It appeared that the online support groups under study were mainly used by female patients. A major part of the postings contained off topic remarks. Popular health related topics were restrictions in daily life and regular medications. Only in a minor proportion of the postings, potential disadvantages were present. Therefore this research suggest that online support groups are a viable option for support."

Interactivity is defined as being on a continuum with three dimensions: human, human/medium and medium interactivity. Human interactivity that encourages dialogic communication between users is considered to be the highest form of interactivity. The findings from the study suggest three forms of user motivations: information seeking/surveillance, socialization and entertainment. In addition, the audience used medium interactive features most frequently, followed by human interactive features. Human/medium interactive features were used least. Further analysis found that all three motivations were predictors of use of medium interactive features. However, while socialization and entertainment remain as predictors, the information seeking/surveillance motivation was not a significant predictor of use of human and human/medium interactive features. Implications and limitations are discussed."
2006-0979,Oppositional Politics: Activism and the Structure of the Blogosphere,"Weblogs: Producers, Users and Effects on the Public Sphere",Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Oppositional Politics: Activism and the Structure of the Blogosphere,"Weblogs: Producers, Users and Effects on the Public Sphere","This paper will utilize public controversies regarding the veracity of digitally manipulated photographs to examine norms of discourse and disputation within and between networks of online weblogs (blogs). It will be argued that the structure of the World Wide Web, relying as it does on explicitly linked pages, encourages the development of an oppositional discourse marked by a qualitatively new pace of checking facts and error correction. This environment gives rise to a new kind of political activism  rather than affirming a position and answering objections as in more traditional political activism, activism on the blogosphere is more explicitly fact-checking itself as activism. Within this model, detecting the factual errors of political opponents is itself a type of political activity  it demonstrates bias, illustrates political connections, and ostensibly exposes publicly unjustifiable interests and commitments. This paper will also seek to explore the practical consequences of this type of activism, both in its positive potential for new political networks and in its proven negative impact on the ability of participants to accurately gauge the degree of public support or opposition for their positions."
2006-0980,Organizational Communication and Burnout,Organizing Emotions,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Organizational Communication and Burnout,Organizing Emotions,"Burnout is a psychological response to work stress. Many studies have been conducted measuring burnout and its causes and consequences. The research into causes of burnout brings up various communication-related constructs, but the relationships with feedback employees receive and communication climate is underexposed. This study investigates these relationships. Data for the current study were collected through a web-based questionnaire held among employees of a Dutch subsidiary of an international financial consultancy firm. The questionnaire included the following clusters of independent variables: (a) background variables, (b) work characteristics, (c) communication, and (d) organizational engagement. Of the four clusters of variables, the organizational engagement variables appeared to be the strongest predictors of job burnout. Still, the communication variables also made an important contribution. Particularly the communication climate and the co-worker social support appeared to be important antecedents of job burnout."

Two theoretical frameworks, social information processing theory (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) and uncertainty reduction theory (Berger & Calabrese, 1975), were drawn upon in considering the role of organizational messages to employees and the function of these messages in the burnout process. In a study of 461 high school speech and debate coaches, perceived organizational support and psychological contract fulfillment were tested as messages from the organization to the employee regarding an employees value to the organization and were found to moderate the relationship between extra role time and burnout."
2006-0982,Organizational Members Experience of Information Overload: Coping with Information Overload,Reviewing Traditional Communication Constructs,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Organizational Members Experience of Information Overload: Coping with Information Overload,Reviewing Traditional Communication Constructs,"In this paper we reviewed research on information overload in an attempt to determine the presence of information overload and then to provide a theoretical background for this concept. We concluded that past research does not give definite insight into the presence of information overload, as the reviewed laboratory and field studies suffered from conceptual as measurement problems. Furthermore, most research on information overload has been conducted in a laboratory setting, and such research does not take into account the context in which organizational members function. In reaction to the state of the art, a field study was conducted to provide insight into the presence of information overload: in-depth interviews. The results show that organizational members do not tend to experience information overload. Organizational members effectively cope with information overload by reducing the necessary cognitive effort. More precisely, organizational members have come to use coping strategies in order to manage all incoming information."

This study examined whether those high in communication apprehension (CA) and/or computer anxiety were more or less likely to establish relationships on-line. Results indicate that high CAs are more likely to experience computer anxiety, experienced more relational stress, and did less affinity-seeking on-line. Those high in CA and computer anxiety spent significantly less time on-line and had fewer on-line relationships. Participants with a high responsive socio-communication orientation were more satisfied with their on-line relationship, but those who were more assertive perceived that others had a more responsive socio-communicative style. No generational differences were found. It is suggested that high CAs may turn to the internet for relational gratification, but that they may actually acerbate a sense of alienation."

Findings suggest that frequency of political talk and size of discussion network are critical concepts to explain political engagement. The contributions of network heterogeneity and network density are modest at best, while orientations toward political talk emerge as important explanatory factors of political involvement. The relevance of orientations toward talk (strategic versus reaching understanding) is discussed and their antecedents explored. An asymmetrical reciprocal model between communication variables and political variables in which communication variables have precedence over political variables is tested and supported by this data."

The consequence of this process of mutual influence over time can be conceptualized as a positive feedback loop, or mutually-reinforcing spirals. Implications of such a perspective include increased attention to more complex, longitudinal modeling of media selection and effects processes; impact of such spirals of influence in youth and adolescent development; analysis of social and psychological factors that control, dampen, or eventually extinguish the influence of such spirals. The influence of relatively subcultures or national cultures that are relatively open or closed with respect to communicative influences are also explored, with implications for social change, social conflict, or homeostasis."
2006-1001,Parallel Processing of Message Production: An Analysis of Bottom-Up Influence,fluence in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Parallel Processing of Message Production: An Analysis of Bottom-Up Influence,Influence in Interpersonal Relationships,"This paper will first survey evidence of bottom up influence found in the literature of emotion, gestures, and speech errors (slips of the tongue), which serves as a general context for analysis of bottom-up influence in message production. It will then proceed to review briefly the key concepts in Greenes AAT II, which provides a theoretical framework for parallel processing analysis. Finally, it will present a preliminary account of parallel processing, which is an extension of AAT II. On the one hand, the automatic route will be fast in coalition and exert immediate influence on action, whereas on the other hand, lower level mechanisms, such as facial configuration, gestures, or automatic messages, tend to impact upper level specifications and require the upper level mechanism to recruit more coalition elements so as to produce more sophisticated coalitions. Therefore, this paper suggests that the coalition formation process as a constant interaction between automatic route and control route, which involves a combination of bottom-up and top-down processings."

In a survey among 451 elementary school children (8-12 years) we investigated (a) to what extent childrens exposure to the news was related to their feelings of fear, worry, anger, and sadness, and (b) to what extent active (i.e., helping children understand what they see on the news) and restrictive (i.e., keeping children from watching the news) parental mediation strategies moderated the emotional impact of the news among younger and older children. Exposure to the news about the assassination was significantly related to childrens emotional responses, also when controlling for age, gender, empathy, and cultural background. Interaction analyses showed that active mediation successfully reduced the relations between news exposure and fear, anger, and sadness, but only among the younger children in the sample. Restrictive mediation had no or even an opposite effect."

The present paper examines the effects of parental monitoring on childrens initiation of marijuana use. It is the first study to do so with a national sample of American youth and the first to use parallel independent youth and parent reports of monitoring. Results indicated that while parent and youth reports were only moderately correlated (r = .28), both the parent and youth monitoring scales displayed similar relationships with marijuana use initiation. A one-point increase in both the parent and youth monitoring scales was associated an approximately 26% decrease in the odds of marijuana use initiation (controlling for relevant covariates). Analysis also revealed a significant interaction between youth-reported monitoring and childrens risk for marijuana initiation. For youth at low risk of marijuana initiation, monitoring offered additional protection against initiation. For youth at high risk, however, monitoring increased the predicted probability of marijuana initiation."

Eighty-nine team members across 15 dispersed groups interacted via a group support system to address an experimental task. Results from the multi-level analysis indicate general support for the prediction that the greatest variance in ability judgments received by target members occurs in the named condition; conversely, results tend to support the prediction that the greatest variation in ability judgments given to other members occurs in the anonymous condition. Effects related to pseudonymous groups are somewhat less clear. Additionally, actual target participation behaviors are generally related to the variation in ability judgments received by target members in the named condition, but rater participation behaviors are not connected to such judgments."
2006-1005,Parting Shots - Leadership Succession - Dialectics of Leadership,"Organizational Communication Interactive Paper Session: Focus on Leadership, Socialization and Interpersonal Relations in Organizations",Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Parting Shots - Leadership Succession - Dialectics of Leadership,"Organizational Communication Interactive Paper Session: Focus on Leadership, Socialization and Interpersonal Relations in Organizations","Leadership succession can be a stressful process characterized by contradictions at multiple organizational and relational levels. These contradictions are expressed discursively in dialectical interplays between the agents participating in the succession process. These dialectics are at times enabling and constraining the leadership succession process, the communication flow, and the relationship between the various parties involved in the transition. By adopting dialectics as an analytical framework this study seeks to foreground communication as an integrated part of the succession process.

The study of City Charity, a nonprofit organization, examines the succession of leadership as captured in the discursive response of the retiring Executive Director to the Board of Directors appointment of a successor. The former Directors resigning letter reflects meta-level dialectics of letting-go vs. holding-on and stability vs. change which characterize the larger leadership succession process. This study analyzes the way agents discursively frame the leadership succession process, the organizational dialectics that accompany the succession process, and the discourse of the actors as both a reflection and a reproduction of change-inducing dialectics."

The former connotes pride and love for a country and the latter refers to a chauvinistic arrogance and desire for dominance in international relations.

This study examines the role of a national newspaper in the presentation of American national identity by analyzing the New York Times editorials after September 11th, 2001. The critical discourse analysis of the New York Times editorials over the three months after 9/11 reveals that the New York Times presentation of American national identity was a dynamic process. Both patriotism and nationalism were presented in the New York Times editorials, but with different priorities in different periods.

Interestingly, two categories were almost equally emphasized in the first month after the terrorist attack. This shows that the New York Times presentation of national identity in editorials was quite balanced. Both war and criticism were given considerable attention. During the second month, the difference between patriotism and nationalism became notable, with the themes of nationalism accounting for approximately twice as much as those of patriotic themes. There was a shift in the presentation of national identity from nationalism to patriotism over the last month of this study. Criticism of the government became the most prominent theme in the presentation of American national identity. Overall, a shift from nationalism to patriotism can be identified over the three-month time frame. War, fear, reconstruction, and criticism were the four major themes of the presentation of American national identity."

The findings demonstrated that the third-person effect and the optimistic bias appeared in traditional media use were also apparent in Internet communication. The effects were moderated by experience and skills that the Interne users possess. The model of Internet use with regard to perceived benefit and threat identified several key variables in Internet communication and established the empirical links between the variables. The model suggests that perceived benefit is a major predictor of information processing in Internet communication. Both active Net use and use despite threat were strongly predicted by perceived benefit. Whereas risks of Internet use was perceived imminent by the users, if perceived benefit from Internet use exceeds perceived threat, people will still actively engage in Internet communication despite there are present and inevitable risks."

This study used a 2X2 experimental design to examine the effect of medium (web and print) and format of presentation (advertorial and standard advertisement) on the credibility of dietary supplement advertisements. Results indicate that the medium of presentation does not affect credibility. However, different formats of presentation lead to different perceptions of credibility. Advertorials were perceived to be more credible than standard advertisements. Moreover, viewers were more likely to buy a product placed in an advertorial than one placed in a standard advertisement. The ramifications of the findings were discussed."

Two hundred sixty undergraduate students who were romantically involved completed open-ended and structured measures concerning a conversation in which their partners made evaluative comments that were perceived honest but hurtful. Messages dealing with relational issues were found to be more face threatening and hurtful than non-relational messages. Both relational satisfaction and perceived honesty of the message were negatively related to perceived face threat. Global self-esteem was negatively associated with perceived negative face threat. After controlling for relational satisfaction and self-esteem, perceived face threat still significantly predicted perceived hurtfulness and relational outcomes of the message. Perceived threats to positive face were more strongly associated with perceived positive relational outcomes than were threats to negative face. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed."

Factors affecting rated importance of information after the group discussion were examined. Participants did not rate information that was mentioned during the discussion as more important than information not mentioned, and participants did not rate shared information they mentioned as more important than unshared information. Participants did rate shared information other group members mentioned as more important than unshared information others mentioned. Participants did not rate their own information as more important than others information, and information that was repeated was not rated as more important. Participants did perceive information supporting their individual position as more important than information against their position, and this confirmation bias was lessened in groups containing an opinion minority. A comparison of minority and majority members in minority-containing groups found that minority members were more open to information than majority members."

A total of 61 subjects (51% female, mean age 19) participated in the research sessions. Participants completed the CEW fluency scale (Author, Article 1), the computer anxiety ratings scale (Heinssen, Glass, & Knight, 1987), and an applied protocol developed for this study. Results show that the less computer anxiety subjects reported, the higher they perceived their CEW fluency to be (p = .001), but there was no significant relationship between computer anxiety and actual fluency (p = .12). There was no gender difference as to actual CEW fluency (p = .11), but women perceived their fluency lower than did men (p = .012). Overall results validate the robustness of the CEW fluency scale, help identify CEW fluency as a digital divide component, and underscore the importance of initiatives to raise womens technological self-confidence."
2006-1012,Perception and Categorization of Computer-Generated Characters,Avatars and Computer-Generated Characters,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Perception and Categorization of Computer-Generated Characters,Avatars and Computer-Generated Characters,"Computer-generated characters, commonly used as avatars and agents, present a broad range of appearance and types. The growing body of research on avatars and agents does not yet provide a categorical and dimensional framework for understanding peoples perception of computer characters. Two studies were conducted to explore peoples categorization of computer characters and dimensions used in the categorization. In Study 1, the participants (N = 40) sorted the images of 70 computer-generated characters into groups. Cluster analysis revealed that human and nonhuman emerged as two large types. Group labels provided by the participants were analyzed to help interpret subcategories within each of the two clusters. In Study 2, a different sample of participants (N = 273) rated the same 70 characters on a set of attributes. The ratings were used in regression analysis to help interpret the multidimensional scaling analysis of the sorting data in Study 1. Four dimensions were identified: humanness, graphic details and stylization, good-natured vs. bad-natured, and gender. The results provide an initial categorical and dimensional framework for further research on perception and effects of computer characters."

This study uses a 4x2 experiment with 296 adult participants to examine whether candidates gender and race are factors of winning elections. Results show that candidates race is more likely than gender to influence voters assessment of the chance to be elected to public offices. Amercians belief in equality is strongly linked to likelihood to support non-White candidates. Also, participants showed greater support for non-White candidates than their estimate of others tendency."
2006-1014,Personal Influence and the Effects of the National Youth Antidrug Media Campaign,"Campaign Causal Attribution: Group Randomized Design, Longitudinal Analysis, and Theory Testing",Health Communication,,,Paper,Personal Influence and the Effects of the National Youth Antidrug Media Campaign,"Campaign Causal Attribution: Group Randomized Design, Longitudinal Analysis, and Theory Testing","Personal Influence (Katz and Lazarsfeld, 1955/2006) put forward and tested a variety of hypotheses about how social contexts constrain media effects. Five such hypotheses from Personal Influence are described: three about interactions of media exposure with social context (Stability, Conformity, and Instrumental) and two about two-step flow effects (Relay and Message Interpretation). Each is then tested here with data from the evaluation of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The evaluation of the campaign has suggested that there were boomerang outcomes  more exposure to the campaign led to more interest in marijuana use. This paper examined whether those effects were magnified through interactions with siblings. In general, there was no evidence that siblings beliefs or behavior interacted with individual exposure to campaign messages in producing effects. However there was evidence that the two-step flow operated: older siblings were themselves affected by their own exposure to the campaign and, in turn, affected the beliefs and behaviors of their younger brothers and sisters."

This paper focuses on the possible importance of the concept of personalization by exploring the possible contribution of personalization of an intranet to usage and effects of this medium. Based on collective action theory, two public goods are identified to which an intranet might contribute: connectivity and communality. Collective use of an intranet is assumed to be necessary for benefits in terms of communality and connectivity to emerge. In order to determine the possible contribution of personalization, the Technology Acceptance Model is discussed, which provides two determinants of technology use: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Personalization is expected increase both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Testing of the theoretical model leads to the conclusion that personalization can indeed have a positive contribution to the use of an intranet - and to the extent that this use results in benefits in terms of communality and connectivity. Personalization is found to positively influence perceived usefulness, which influences individual use, which in turn influences collective use. Collective use leads to benefits in terms of communality, which influences connectivity."

Advertisements containing visual metaphors deliver persuasive claims in visual modality and metaphorical style of rhetoric, both of which may increase the persuasiveness of messages. The study has three advertisement message conditions: literal visual image with verbal claim, metaphorical visual image with verbal anchoring, and metaphorical visual image without verbal anchoring. Considering attitude toward the brand and purchase intentions as the outcome, results show that only ads containing visual metaphors without verbal anchoring metaphors were significantly different from the other two types of ads. This suggests that visual metaphors may be effective due to visual argumentation rather than the metaphorical rhetoric."

The method unraveled the concerns of the villagers who took the photographs to depict their perceived needs. Through their snapshots, they indicated the need to diversify their community's economic base (currently limited to snake production and processing), for better transportation, and for more markets for their products. On the other hand, the faculty and students of a university recently mandated to develop an extension force to serve the village's agricultural needs indicated in a focus group that their rural clients would be clamoring for more markets, lenient government policies, and educational opportunities. The strengths and limitations of the photo-elicitation technique to determine how the two groups co-orient with each other with respect to village development priorities and to assess village needs for extension planning are discussed."
2006-1018,"Photojournalism, Fashion, and the Modernisation of Everyday Life",Boundaries and Transgressions in Visual Discourse,Visual Studies,,,Extended Abstract,"Photojournalism, Fashion, and the Modernisation of Everyday Life",Boundaries and Transgressions in Visual Discourse,"This paper explores the role played by visual journalism in imagining, documenting and critiquing modernisation.

Social democratic modernisation began in the 1930s as Britain moved out of the Depression and into the Second World War. Photojournalisms finest hours have been amply documented in histories of journalism. Less well understood has been what happened to that social-visual impulse. Who took over the tasks of documenting the realities of contemporary life and of building a wide readership for social photography?

The answer lies in the explosion of fashion and style magazines like The Face that transformed the business in the 1990s. Returning to the great days of photojournalism and the picture press, especially Picture Post under its wartime editor Tom Hopkinson, we examine how the journalistic vision of those times  to document but also to celebrate ordinary British lives  has migrated from the news media to fashion magazines. These are now the only place where ordinary high-street readers can find the same level of visual intensity, talent and resources devoted to the pleasures of the still photograph that characterised Picture Post and the other photo-magazines of the 1930s and 40s such as Life."

Overall, the two newspapers visually portrayed the Iraq War differently. Further, the more spontaneous or direct coverage of actually ongoing events were rare at best, and were exclusively found in photographs that ran in the Guardian. One aspect of the pictorial coverage, however, seems unprecedented: the emphasis on the human cost of the war focusing on Iraqi civilians. Moreover, images of loss of military life were scarce but still available."
2006-1020,Pinning the Blame: Effects of Formal Cues in News on Causal Attributions,Framing and Blaming,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Pinning the Blame: Effects of Formal Cues in News on Causal Attributions,Framing and Blaming,"Two experiments examined psychological mechanisms in attribution of causality based on news consumption. In experiment one, verb voice was manipulated in four news stories; when active voice was used to describe a partys actions relative to an event, that party was more seen as cause of that event than when passive voice was used. In experiment two, three news stories about conflicts between two parties were manipulated such that alternate versions presented alternate parties version of events first. Participants ascribed more causality to parties whose positions were presented second, and less to those whose positions were presented first. Results are discussed in light of framing theory and current journalistic practices."

Verb voice and order of views were factorially manipulated in several presented news stories. Both factors exhibited an effect consistent with hypotheses. When active voice was used to describe a partys actions relative to an event, that party was more seen as cause of that event than when passive voice was used. Participants ascribed more causality to parties whose positions were presented second, and less to those whose positions were presented first, but only when both parties actions were expressed in passive voice. The causal attributions were strongly linked to political support of the involved parties. Results are discussed in light of framing theory and current journalistic practices."

This article utilizes a cross-national perspective and focuses on regulatory aspects of the media convergence issue in order to explore the disconnect between the hype and realities of convergence. Three research questions characterize the relevant existing policy initiatives, identify obstacles to convergence and in comparativist terms ascertain which policy models have been relatively more effective. Ultimately, this piece adopts a case study structure integrating convergence policy models in the US, South Africa, Japan and India."

Web based technology affects political campaign advertising significantly. As a recent addition to political campaign advertising, use of the Internet is full of research potential. This paper explores how such technology has influenced political campaign advertising. Applying technological determinism and media effects theories, the paper briefly discusses the history of technology and the way it has affected political campaigns. Working on the assumption that campaign strategists would include Internet advertising among their tools it was expected that Internet political campaign ads would be relatively easy to find, and using traditional media coding schemes, the content of the Internet ads could be analyzed. Results of the present research indicate that while interest in the political uses of the Internet are growing, presidential candidates and their campaign strategists have yet to embrace the Internet as an advertising tool. The lack of Internet political campaign ads, the implications of their absence and recommendations for future research absence finish out the discussion."
2006-1024,Political Discourses as Communicative Networks: An Investigation of Distortions in Online Deliberation,Mediated and Interpersonal Talk about Politics,Political Communication,,,Paper,Political Discourses as Communicative Networks: An Investigation of Distortions in Online Deliberation,Mediated and Interpersonal Talk about Politics,"The theory of deliberative democracy is gaining more and more attention and support among researchers of political communication. However, it still lacks an empirical foundation and confirmation of many of its claims. This paper contributes to the empirical investigation of deliberation as a form of communication with a comparative analysis of nine cases of deliberation held on the Internet. It focuses on the question of how equal and symmetric deliberation is, and confronts the normative ideal with data from real-world political discourses. It is shown that all of the discourses are strongly distorted with respect to the contributions as well as the references in the debate. Furthermore, the interrelation of asymmetry of discourse and interactivity is analyzed. This gives rise to considerations of the positive functions of inequality of participation in large-scale discourses. Implications for the theory of deliberative democracy are discussed, as well as the need for further research."
2006-1025,Political Discussion and the Self-Destructing State: An Historical Account of State-Sanctioned Talk in the German Democratic Republic from 1980-1985,Mediated and Interpersonal Talk about Politics,Political Communication,,,Paper,Political Discussion and the Self-Destructing State: An Historical Account of State-Sanctioned Talk in the German Democratic Republic from 1980-1985,Mediated and Interpersonal Talk about Politics,"The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 caught observers by surprise, and retrospective accounts of East Germany have failed to explain how an unorganized, socially isolated population took to the streets just days after the fortieth anniversary of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Conventional accounts of the GDR suggest that its propaganda apparatus was comprehensive but incapable of sufficiently persuading the public and suppressing dissent. This view, however, does not recognize the potential for face-to-face collective institutions created by the state to inadvertently create an oppositional public understanding of the GDR. We advance a general theoretical account of how a state can create structured opportunities for dissent that leads to resistance. We then present the results of original archival and interview data that demonstrate this very pattern of unintended consequences in East Germany from 1980-1985. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of these findings for future political communication research inside and outside totalitarian regimes."
2006-1026,Political Support and Media Use,Media Use and the Formation of Political Attitudes II,Political Communication,,,Paper,Political Support and Media Use,Media Use and the Formation of Political Attitudes II,"This study addresses the relation between media use and political support in the Netherlands. Althought the thesis of media malaise and the spiral of cynicism are an almost conventional wisdom, in this study we test the correlation between the use of media on the one hand and political attitudes on the other hand. Based on a survey from 2000 (N=825), we calculated correlation between a number of variables.
It turned out that watching television in general is positively related to political cynicism and negatively to political self-efficacy. However, reading newspapers in general, watching political programs on television, and reading political articles in newspapers, are negatively related to political cynicism and positively related to political self-efficacy. Controlling for social demographic variables, political knowlegde and political ideology, only brought marginal changes.
For the political attitudes we used and the use of political programs on television or in newspapers, support for the media malaise thesis has not been found."

In this essay, I draw upon Giddens metatheory of structuration and Habermassian public sphere theory to focus on key thematic fault lines that have emerged in contemporary Hindi cinema, including the binaries of tradition-modernity, popular-artistic, east-west, local-global, and motherland-diaspora. Through this analysis, I illustrate how structuration helps to explicate the production and reproduction of these tensions within the context of globalized media. I conclude by outlining an agenda for research."

Using in-depth interviews, this study sought views of 41 Singaporeans aged 21 to 30, with a balance of heterosexual, gay male, and lesbian respondents, on the types of value and harm they perceived for themselves and their communities from SEM use. Our findings showed that the types of value legally recognized in Singapore were all perceived to be present in SEM to varying degrees. Respondents also reported some harmful effects. The findings suggest that a broader look at the value of SEM is necessary in ongoing policy debates about SEM regulation, and that SEM might contribute to individual self-realization, particularly for members of sexual minorities."

However, in the 1990s, African American and postcolonial feminisms criticized feminist knowledge building for its Western bias, upon which false claims to universalism were based, and for its insensitivity to issues of race, class and cultural difference. These literatures, as well as postcolonial literatures on globalization more generally, attempted to construct knowledge, sensitive to issues of difference that mediated between cultural specificity and universality. This paper discusses how these literatures might be useful and/or limiting for understanding womens social movements in the context of globalization. It puts to test feminists claim that they are committed to building practical knowledge, by citing four cases of womens activist practice around the globe for assessment. It finds that the traveling of discourses between the academia and the grassroots is often uneven, unreciprocated, and under theorized."

In this paper, I map and analyze academic theory, magazine articles, two documentary films, and a current events book, each of which is exemplary of the discourse concerning post-Fordism in the 1980s and 90s U.S. I outline three ways in which women in service work were paradigmatically configured in public culture and show how concern for service sector women was overshadowed by pathos associated with blue-collar mens job loss. A retroactive gender politics became the mode through which advocacy for these men was performed. Through explicating the layers of sexism, racism, and classism at play in this field, I argue that anxiety about post-Fordism was largely expressed in ways that assumed white men to be the primary victims of deindustrialization."
2006-1031,Power of Online Social Network Capital: The Case of South Korea,CMC and Social Networking or Support,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Power of Online Social Network Capital: The Case of South Korea,CMC and Social Networking or Support,"This study firstly aimed at finding out some important factors that exert influences on status aspiration. Second, the relationships among economic capital, human capital, and social network capital were analyzed. Third, the functions and characteristics of online social network capital were compared with those of offline social network capital. Finally, I examined whether online social network capital affects status aspiration. These research questions were tested by surveying 512 college students in South Korea. The results showed that the online social network capital formed or maintained in online communities was positively associated with status aspiration. These results can be explained by the fact that the members of online communities frequently exchange emotional support as well as informational one. Even adolescents lacking offline social network capital could achieve alternative or complimentary social network capital through online community activities. These findings let us expect that the Internet can function as a liberating medium in this era, when knowledge or information plays a pivotal role in acquiring and maintaining social power."
2006-1032,"Power, Self-Concern, and Other-Concern in Negotiation with a Fully Integrative Potential",cial/Interpersonal Influence in Information Processing,Information Systems,,,Paper,"Power, Self-Concern, and Other-Concern in Negotiation with a Fully Integrative Potential",Social/Interpersonal Influence in Information Processing,"The effect of power on negotiators strategic choices, tactic usage, and negotiation outcomes were examined employing the Dual Concern Theory (Rubin, Pruitt, & Kim, 1994). One hundred and seventy pairs of participants (N=340) engaged in a three person role-play negotiation game using a simple conflict of interest scenario with a hidden integrative potential. Other-concern was induced by the instruction to be more cooperative as well as the anticipation of future interaction with the other negotiator. Self-concern was induced by the motivation induction and high accountability to the constituents. Power was induced by the status power and resource power. Result showed that only 12.4 % of the participants reached an integrative solution. Among the nine tactics coded in the study, emphasizing self-concern, showing other-concern, information seeking, information sharing, reacting positively, and indicating problem solving attitude were significantly and positively correlated with integrative strategy. Current study hypothesized the effect of the power with the view of the power as a spoiler, or as a hindrance to achieve integrative solution. This hypothesis is partially supported in that having more power increased a negotiator to insist on their position and engage in competitive strategy especially when negotiator had high self-concern. Possible explanations and implications of the study are offered."

This situation mirrors the globalization of theatrical films, which represents the dynamic characteristics of theatrical films demonstrated by their global cross-border flow and the issues and changes that the theatrical film industry has experienced.

This study considers the case of the Japanese theatrical film market with special attention to the past 15 years, from 1990 through 2004. Ever since theatrical films were introduced to Japan in November 1896, the Japanese market has experienced diverse issues and gone through various changes, often in tandem with the political and social climate of Japan. Therefore, this study first offers an overview not only of an aspect of changes in the release numbers that indicate how Japanese and foreign films has shared the market, but also of other aspects, such as whether foreign films have become more diverse in participating countries and regions of production. For this examination, the number as well as origin of foreign films that were imported to and released in Japan (1946 through 1954 and 1955 through 1989 respectively) are analyzed.

Based on the findings concerning these aspects, this study narrows a focus to the Japanese market over the past 15 years, from 1990 through 2004, and examines changes in the release number of foreign films and their origins. This study was based on primary data collected during a field research in Japan."
2006-1034,Practical Reasoning: Making Room for Pluralism by Redefining Journalism,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Practical Reasoning: Making Room for Pluralism by Redefining Journalism,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"Motivated by the ideal of pluralism, this paper explores the background of an apparent paradox: although a multitude of different kinds of journalism may have evolved, because journalism is only vaguely defined by connections to 'the media' and 'news', current journalism is marked by increasing standardization. Why? It is proposed that a silent definition of journalism is at work, understanding journalism on rational terms as part of a political life of irrationality. Against this background, the standardization of journalism is taken to represent attempts to rationalize journalism. But journalism cannot be rationalized, it is argued, because rationalism is a framework of thought that is alien to political life and to journalism. As an alternative framework for the philosophy and practice of journalism, the classical notions of praxis  signifying human action  and practical reason are introduced. They combine politics and reasoning and are strangers to standardization."

Beginning with a review of the constitutive metamodel and early responses to it, the paper goes on to examine Russills argument and assess its implications for a reconstructed field of communication theory including pragmatism as a distinct tradition. In conclusion, it is argued that the problems of pluralistic community in the field of communication theory are not unconnected to the corresponding problems in society generally."

However, recent research suggests that enhanced self-disclosure can also occur in non-anonymous instant messaging (IM). The aim of this study is to develop and test an Internet-attribute-perception model to explain the precursors and underlying processes of self-disclosure during IM. We surveyed 1,203 Dutch adolescents on their IM use, their perceptions of the relevance of IM attributes (i.e., controllability and reduced nonverbal cues), and their online self-disclosure. Using structural equation modeling, we found that adolescents perceptions of the relevance of IM attributes encouraged their feelings of disinhibition, which in turn enhanced their online self-disclosure. As expected, private and public self-consciousness and social anxiety stimulated adolescents perceptions of the relevance of IM attributes, but did not directly influence online self-disclosure. The study shows that users perceptions of Internet attributes can no longer be ignored in future Internet-effects research."

Getting their news materials in media coverage is, therefore, a key professional responsibility for public relations practitioners. In Indonesia, this practice constitutes one of the most important tasks of pubic relations. However, little research was ever conducted on predicting Indonesian journalists use of public relations-generated news material. Given that Indonesia is the largest nation in Southeast Asia and the most populous Muslim nation in the world, it would be interesting to see if Indonesian journalistic practices differ from other nations.
The survey for this study obtained input from 299 Indonesian journalists with national newspapers and television stations in the capital city of Jakarta. The research found that news value factor comes first in predicting use of public relations-generated news materials. The survey showed that journalists are under the pressure of their organizations business interests, and that informal relations play a significant role in determining the use and acceptance of news materials. Envelope journalism, or providing positive coverage in exchange for cash payment, seems to be embraced by public relations practitioners and journalists. However, this study finds this influence is not as significant as the fundamental tenets in journalism."

Findings indicate that sexual disposition contributed significantly to the prediction of standard-fare Internet pornography use and arousal. No association was found however, between sexual disposition and deviant Internet pornography use and arousal. Antisocial disposition also significantly added to the predictability of regular Internet pornography use and arousal. Most interestingly, those higher in antisocial disposition, though more likely to use both standard-fare and deviant pornographic Internet content, than those who are lower in antisocial disposition were only more likely to report arousing in response to deviant content. A new way of assessing Internet pornography use is also discussed."

This study develops a model involving gender, generalized self-efficacy, psychological need for privacy, Internet use experience, Internet use fluency, and beliefs in privacy rights, as potential influences on online privacy concerns. Survey responses from 413 college students were analyzed by bivariate correlations, hierarchical regression, and structural equation modelling. Regression results showed that beliefs in privacy rights, and a psychological need for privacy, were the main influences on online privacy concerns. The proposed structural model was not well supported by the data, but a revised model, linking self-efficacy with psychological need for privacy, and indicating indirect influence of Internet experience and fluency on online privacy concerns about privacy through beliefs in privacy rights, was supported by the data."

This study examines (a) the prevalence and patterns of multiple media use and multitasking and (b) the media and audience factors that influence such behaviors. Consistent with previous research, this study found that youth use multiple media multitask with media frequently. In addition, the study data suggest that media factors including ownership of media in bedrooms, and audience factors particularly sensation seeking personality are significant predictors of using multiple media and multitasking. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are further discussed."

Pregnant women in particular experience physical discomfort and emotional and role-specific readjustment as a romantic partner and caretaker. The present study investigated the extent to which maintenance behaviors were enacted by pregnant couples as perceived by pregnant women and the extent to which the perceptions and uses of relational maintenance communication by pregnant women affect sexual and relational satisfaction. Frequency of sex and sexual satisfaction were regarded as independent maintenance strategies. The results indicated that in pregnant womens view (1) relationship maintenance efforts are common during pregnancy, (2) pregnant womens perceptions of their partners uses of assurances, shared tasks, and positivity are positively associated with the frequency of sex, (3) constructive maintenance communication is a good index of a relationship-enhancing function of sexual intercourse and is likely to reduce womens anxiety associated with having sex during pregnancy, and (4) Stafford and Canarys (1991) relational maintenance behaviors alone account for more than two thirds of the variance in relational satisfaction. Sexual frequency and sexual satisfaction did not have a significant bearing on relationship satisfaction."

However, a recent claim that presence is a response to media form while involvement or emotion is a response to media content has thrown an interesting twist into the general assumption about the relationship between presence and involvement. In fact, a previous study (Kurita, 2005) found that involvement may not necessarily be a dimension of presence. Next, this study asks how presence and involvement are differed (or similar) in terms of emotional dimensions (e.g. arousal and valence). Study 1 investigated the relationships between presence/involvement and emotion by manipulating sound stimuli in terms of arousal, valence and length. Two main findings were, 1) the strong sense of presence was more likely to be experienced during pleasant stimuli rather than during unpleasant stimuli. 2) A main effect of arousal existed for involvement but not for presence. Next, Study 2 examined the effect of dominance dimension of emotion on presence and involvement. It was found that both low and high dominance elicited a higher level of presence and involvement. Overall, the results indicated that emotion induced from media contents is probably related to presence. Further, it was found that gender matters for the sense of presence but does not matter for involvement. The results revealed a complex set of interactions of emotion and other factors such as gender and length that combine to determine the sense of presence."

AmI is still in its developmental phase and is headed towards the first stages of diffusion.
Characteristics of AmI design can be observed, among others, in the promotion material of initial producers. A literature study revealed that AmI originally envisioned a central role for the user, convenience that AmI offers them and that attention should be paid to critical policy issues such as privacy and a potential loss of freedom. A content analysis of current promotion material of several high-tech companies revealed that these original ideas are not all reflected in the material. Attributes which were used most in the promotion material were connectedness, control, easiness and personalization. An analysis of the pictures in the promotion material showed that almost half of the pictures contained no humans but appliances. These results only partly correspond to the original vision on AmI, since the emphasis is now on technology. The results represent a serious problem, since both users, as well as critical policy issues are underexposed in the current promotion material."

A survey of 404 physicians studied presumed influence of DTC advertising on patients and whether presumed effects influenced physicians response to patient requests of advertised drugs. Results supported the proposed model. Greater presumed DTC advertising influence was associated with refusal of patient requests even after controlling for other respondent characteristics. Findings also suggest taking a multi-dimensional view of the presumed influence model. The results are discussed in relation to existing theoretical work. Future research recommendations are also provided.

Analysis of cancer-related stories in 44 major U.S. daily newspapers during 2003 reveals that stories for which cancer was the primary topic (N = 2448) rarely contained efficacy messages, which provide information about skills related to prevention and screening behaviors. Efficacy messages were most likely to appear in stories that came from wire sources, contained mobilizing information (additional resources for readers), or mentioned lung, skin, breast, prostate, or colon cancer. The results have implications for effectively influencing cancer-related behaviors through news reports."

The experiment tests for the outcomes of group sessions combined with individual level counseling vs. individual level counseling only. The results indicate that the group and individual level interventions combined have a greater impact on risk reduction behaviors than the individual level only sessions. Knowledge about HIV is relatively high, and there was little change across groups. The POP intervention influenced the relative importance of various referent groups, but normative beliefs were not impacted."

Regardless of why content is labeled fantasy or reality, sometimes signaled in the content and sometimes determined by pre-existing beliefs, it is presumed that the summary perception of fantasy versus reality matters. The mechanism by which perceived reality may influence media effects, however, is uncertain. We propose physiological arousal as the mechanism by which perceived realism may increase attention and subsequently influence what people remember and how they feel in relation to media content. This study tested physiological arousal responses to content labeled as fantasy or reality. Results indicated that heart rate relative to baseline was significantly greater for real content relative to fictional content. In addition, there were significant increases in skin conductance levels for arousing content (e.g., segments with sexual, emotional or threatening themes) labeled as real."

We conducted an experiment comparing the effects of exposure to a priming article about the importance of leadership traits followed by viewing an ad for a particular candidate with the effects of seeing the ad twice (the repetition condition or just seeing the ad once (the ad control condition). Participants (N=387) were undergraduate students. The results showed that the priming plus ad condition and the repetition condition has similar positive effects on dynamism, competence, trustworthiness, liking, and attitude toward the ad. The effects on intention to vote for the candidate were weaker. No differences were found between the prime and repetition groups and their effects on the outcome variables. The results suggest that when multiple, consistent messages are involved, priming effects operate similarly to repetition effects."

Using the natural experiment of battleground versus non-battleground states I examine the influence of the first Swift Boat Veterans for Truth television advertisement and incumbent President George W. Bushs campaign advertisement, Solemn Duty, on the presidential character trait strong leader. The analyses of this study suggests that these two advertisements, in part, caused a increase in Bushs rating and the decline in Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerrys rating as a strong leader during the middle of August 2004. Respondents who lived in battleground states  states where the political advertisements were aired  showed statistically significant fluctuations in their ratings of the candidates as a strong leader while those in non-battleground states did not."

Building on the work of Napoli (2002) and Koschat and Putsis (2000) this paper focuses on the effect of how the racial composition of a magazines readership affects its advertising rates. Most interestingly it analyzes demographic data for magazines targeted at the general American readership and examines if advertising rates decrease when the magazines minority readership increases. The findings show that a one percent increase in the white readership of a magazine causes the advertising rates to go up by $1202.69, but a similar percent rise in African American readers causes the rates too fall by $1884.28. Finally, the study discusses the implications arising from the economics of the purposefully unwanted readers and recommends specific public policy changes that will rectify the discrimination in todays media market."

Using a between-subjects design, Experiment 1 revealed a significant inverse relationship between rationality and probative value judgments among those exposed to narrative reports and a positive relationship between experientiality and probative value within the same condition, as predicted by CEST. Contrary to CEST, within the graphical condition, neither rationality nor experientiality were related to probative value judgments; however, high rationals judged graphical reports to have greater probative value than anecdotes, but low rationals judged reports in both communication modes to be equally probative. Probative value was found to be differentially predictive of apprehension, problem seriousness and story emotion judgments for individuals favoring the two processing styles, indicating that under certain conditions, rational and experiential processing styles modulate each other. In Experiment 2, participants made comparative judgments of anecdotal and graphical reports probative value. Regardless of processing style, participants judged the graphical report to be more probative than the anecdotal report and the anecdotal report to be more emotional than the graphical report. Among high experientials, high rationals judged the graphical report to portend and more serious problem than low rationals; among low experientials however, high and low rationals did not differ. Differences between the two experiments findings are partially explained by the activation of processing rules among low rationals when making comparative judgments in Experiment 2."

Public health campaign for organ donation has scarcely been conducted across the nation. However, the year 2005 in Korea has seen a big shift in awareness about and attitudes toward organ donation, especially corneal transplantation, which was possible by one entertainment-education television program entitled Open Your Eyes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the characteristics of the program, Open Your Eyes, on para-social interaction and behavioral intention for organ donation. To verify 7-factor structure of measurement model, a CFA was performed by using the LISREL 8.53 SEM program. The study examined the relationship between characteristics of the program, para-social interaction (i.e., involvement with characters in the program), and behavioral change toward organ donation. Identification of the relationship between these variables and examination of the effects of these variables on behavioral intention provides helpful suggestions for entertainment-education programs promoting organ donation in Korea."

The managerial view which defines PR as the management of relationships is the dominant understanding and informs the Excellence study as well as works in the areas of relationship, crisis, campaign and issue management. The alternative understanding is sociological and situates PR in the public sphere. The paper argues that the sociological understanding, developed by theorists in Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, is more relevant to the challenge posed by the phase of reflexive modernization that advanced societies in the West are currently undergoing."

The supposition is made that people with the same psychological orientation are more likely to have the same communicator style and form stronger ties and that androgynous individuals are more likely to have a central position in the network. Results showed that particular styles and traits did not translate into higher profile positions (centrality) in the network, however, communicator styles and psychological orientation were associated with who communicated with whom. These findings are discussed in terms of how they extend an understanding of organizational communication relationships. Because the data were conducted in an organization located in Belarus, this study also extends and discusses the implications of organizational communication research and the use of various measures developed in the United States as it pertains to their applications in non-U.S. settings."

Several studies have evaluated the impact of anti-marijuana ads on adolescents marijuana-related beliefs, attitude and behaviors. This paper presents additional evidence for the effect of these ads by focusing on the message sensation value (MSV) of the ads, and collecting both overt self-reported measures (perceived ad effectiveness, perceptions of ad arousal value and valence) and covert psycho-physiological reactions (skin conductance, heart rate, and facial electromyograms) in response to the ads. A 2 Effectiveness (high versus low) X 2 Order (high MSV first versus low MSV first) X 2 MSV (high versus low) X 6 Message mixed design is used. 73 6th to 12th grade adolescents participated in the study. The current study provides some evidence for the construct validity of MSV by showing its direct impact on physiological arousal. High MSV ads seem to interfere with adolescents ability to differentiate strong versus weak arguments of the ads, reflected through their corrugator responses while viewing the ads. Conflicting results are found between participants self reports and physiological reactions. Although participants rate ads in the high-effectiveness condition as less effective than ads in the low-effectiveness condition, they indeed show more positive and fewer negative facial reactions while viewing ads in the high-effectiveness condition. This effect is especially evident for low-MSV ads and high-risk adolescents. Thus psycho-physiological measures may provide an alternative and, perhaps, more sensitive way to detect deeper-level ad effects. Limitations of the study and future directions are also discussed."

The present study explored the relations between the publics receptivity towards the Iraq war coverage, perceived news coverage quality and support for the war. In explicating these relations, the publics sense of core values that could help drive the rallying effects was also be examined in relation to the constructs of news frames, news coverage quality and support for the war. Results indicate that Iraq War news frames, including Iraq as a security threat and rationale for war,along with sense of core values and news coverage qualitywere all significantly related to public support for the war. These results were further analyzed by a structural equation model, with additional discussion provided."

The Qing government, based on an unstable political situation, evaluated and dealt with these opinions strategically, adopting them in policy-making or suppressing them."

We draw from this archive to argue that despite industry efforts to thwart tobacco control groups, activists have been able to adopt successful counter public relations techniques. By investigating a watershed case pertaining to a campaign for smoke-free restaurant ordinances in Colorado, we show how contemporary activist techniques mirror those of their more professionalized adversaries. We need to better account for these groups who use a variety of PR techniques to remain outside of the zone of compromise. Indeed, tobacco control activists employed values advocacy, intensification, and capitalized on benefits to persuade a variety of publics. Moving beyond Grunig and Hunts (1984) widely accepted normative theoretical models is thus necessary to better account for the sophisticated range of contemporary public relations activism."

The results of this study are a series of frames used by the Bush/Cheney and Kerry/Edwards U.S. presidential campaigns in 2004 to address the issue of healthcare coverage in America with the Latino population. Five distinct frames emerged from a content analysis of 107 public relations strategies. These frames were used in public relations campaigns strategies to encourage Latinos to register and vote. The main Bush/Cheney frames were the Bush Agenda for America frame, the Combative frame: Bush Policy vs. Kerry Policy and the Latino American Dream frame. The chief Kerry/Edwards campaign frames were the Stronger America frame, and the Failure and Struggle frame. These frames showed the distinct ways in which each political campaign belabored to balance empowerment mobilization efforts with the conflict-driven nature of election contests. The analysis and conclusions in this study highlight the importance of resorting to key values, morals and culturally relevant language, code words and catchphrases when designing campaign strategies targeting ethnic minorities. Additionally, these findings demonstrate the way professionals in the communication field may use this analytical model to measure difficult to measure concepts such as power, ideology, hegemony and culture. This postmodern approach to appraise campaign messages will hopefully empower professionals to better design and evaluate public relations campaign strategies in todays multicultural society."

It also examined the influence of culture on corporate web site content. Results show that customer and investor are primary publics addressed by corporate web sites, whereas press is secondary audience across countries. Findings also reveals that culture impacts corporate web site content in targeting government and addressing social responsibility issues (corporate image). Comparing with non-Western countries, Western countries tend to address more on social responsibility issues. Meanwhile, a country with a higher score on the cultural dimension of power distance tends to address policy issues and post news regarding political figures and government officials on the Web."

I offer reasons why the use of face-to-face communication by political movement advocates warrants investigation, review the applicable literature, describe my inquiry methods, and explicate results and implications. The resulting functional theory of advocate communication increases our knowledge about communication of social advocates and provides an opportunity to extend application of previous communication theory in a new context. Advocates use face-to-face communication to perform a variety of functions, including increasing attendance at events, arranging logistical detail, building community, persuading the general public, lobbying, and facilitating mass media coverage. Interpersonal communication between advocates was particularly important for arranging logistical detail and building community."

The selected episode presents a story about two interracial families that swap their wives for an ultimate makeover. The analysis indicates that while drawing heavily on racial stereotypes, the episode does not offer a single, dominant ideological perspective on race. Despite its nature as entertainment, the show is potentially educational and progressive. The active use of racial conflict in The Wife Swap makes for good TV because it constructs a message that racial prejudice is wrong and that people can learn from the difference and diversity."

How the South African Broadcasting Service Covers Zimbabwe,News Contents in International Perspective,"In South Africa, the national broadcaster, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) broadcasts television news in different languages. This paper examines and analyses differences in how two of these news services, the English and Nguni services, reported Zimbabwe during a three month period in 2004. Somewhat surprisingly, only just over half of the news broadcasts were carried on both services and even then, editing and voice over choices produced subtly or markedly different effects.
Discussions with various television producers at the SABC allow us to understand the managerial and cultural changes within the organisation that have given the different stations such a measure of autonomy. The paper concludes by suggesting that Bourdieus work on intellectual and professional fields might be the most rewarding way of understanding these changes."

This paper examines the role of these programs in the political communication process in a social context in which the government is weak, the media are strong and social grievance is high. The post-colonial Hong Kong was chosen as a case study. This paper conceptualizes radio talk show in Hong Kong as a peoples council. Survey findings and a case study both support the argument that in a big media/small government society, radio talk show not only serves as important public opinion formulator but it also turns itself into a powerful surrogate political institution. It does a better job than the Legislative Council in channeling complaints, debating major social issues, speaking for the people, questioning government officials, educating the public and monitoring the government. The radio talk show can promote political activism and play an influential role in shuffling top political leaders."

The effective Sunny Days, Healthy Ways (SDHW) skin cancer prevention curriculum for children ages 5-11 was translated into three age-appropriate interactive multimedia computer programs on CD-ROM with core messages tailored to users risk for sunburn. Each computer program provided up to 60 minutes of playtime and included at least five health communication modules covering shade, peak sun hours, cover-up clothing and sunscreen. The ability of the computer programs to increase knowledge, change attitudes favorably, and increase sun protective behaviors was evaluated in a pair-matched randomized pretest-posttest control group study, employing 12 public primary schools, 63 classes and teachers, and 847 students in the western U.S. The computer programs were compared to teacher-led presentations from the original SDHW curriculum. The results consistently showed that adding the interactive computer program to the teacher-led presentation improved self-reported behavioral outcomes over the teacher-led presentation alone. Outcomes showed that the skin cancer prevention computer programs were effective at providing health education and producing health behavior change, especially in younger students."

The present research integrates these developments into a theory of media attendance within the framework of Banduras (1986) Social Cognitive Theory. Respondents from MMO player discussion boards, or guilds, were recruited to complete an on-line questionnaire. Multiple regression techniques were used to test a new model of media attendance in which motivations examined in previous empirical studies, moderated by MMO self-efficacy, joins habitual behavior and deficient self-regulation as determinants of MMO consumption behavior."

Through an analysis of SELF magazines 1999 series, Dianes Diary, which follows one womans real time account of her battle with breast cancer, it is possible to demonstrate the role of narrative in context, action, and interaction. Dianes Diary both reproduces and resists the metaphors of war and hope that shape our prime narrative of breast cancer, thereby reshaping understandings of this disease for the author, her readers, and the medical community. As an investigation of how our communication about health and illness influence our understanding of a disease like breast cancer, this essay seeks to demonstrate both the power and importance of narrative ways of knowing."

We examine the relatively understudied relationship between fantasy and reality narratives, focusing on the time dimension and its role in the construction of situational representations. Undergraduate participants read stories in which the characters and their actions were either consistent with reality, i.e., a wolf attacking a chicken, or where they were inconsistent with reality, and therefore fantastical, i.e., a book attacking a pencil. The fantasy and reality narratives had parallel plots, matched for word frequency, verb type, verb valence and word count. Participants read either a fantasy narrative then a reality narrative or the reverse. The experiments assessed participants' judgments of similarity, duration and event structure for the two narrative types. The judged duration of the second narrative was shorter than the first narrative irrespective of which narrative type was first, (consistent with the contextual change hypothesis for duration estimates, Block 1985). This difference was moderated by which narrative was read first. Participants estimated that the second narrative was shorter by 3.5% when the fantasy narrative was read first or 14% shorter when the reality narrative was read first. This finding suggests that people use real events to ground their comprehension of fantasy narratives."

While we agree with several authors that the term reality television is problematic, there is no doubt that the idea of simulated reality along with the associated narratives of elimination and dog-eat-dog have provided fresh impetus into television industries that have lost audiences to other more interactive lean forward technologies. We refer to these innovations as engines. They include million dollar prizes in quiz shows; exotic locations, elimination; audience adjudication, instant celebrity, and renovation"

Especially by using the work of Foucault (1980; 1984) resistance as a concept entered the academia. The linking of power and resistance has resulted in an academic believe in the power of marginality. These margins are deconstructed and represented as resistance and radical social change. A dangerously uncritical construction of the margins occurs as sites of resistance. This neo-romanticism presents resistance as a subversive field which is positioned opposite of hegemony. In this paper we will use an empiric study on gender bending as resistance to hegemonic gender identities in popular visual culture to elaborate on the conceptualisation of resistance. Resistance will be rearticulated as part of a hegemonic discourse and the notions of partial and potential are introduced to construct a theoretical inside in the concept of resistance.

The current investigation analyzed lyrics of 260 rap/hip hop and rock songs from the Billboard top-charts of 1993 and 2003 for rebellious messages. As earlier research indicated that provocative messages may merely offer fun-seeking excitement instead of hostile arousal, coding differentiated between proactive and reactive rebelliousness. Results show that the majority of top songs contains rebellious messages. Songs with proactive messages are more common in the rap/hip hop genre and have increased."

Regular elections permit an orderly turnover without the upheaval of California's historic recall election, and Democrat Davis was duly reelected governor in 2002. But an electoral mob turned on him in 2003 and replaced him with movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger. This paper examines why Davis rhetorical strategies failed to save him from a political lynching. Using a genre of apologia, the author theorizes that Davis' above-the-fray strategy of transcendence and posture of vindication were interpreted as disdain for the people. Condemning the recall drive as a right-wing ploy, Davis ignored charges against him that most voters, it turned out, found legitimate. Targets of recall attempts would be better served by a posture of justification or explanation accompanied by a strategy of denial, bolstering or differentiation, the author finds. Davis' ouster illustrates that politicians under siege cannot expect to survive if they cannot explain and justify their leadership."

It employed a 2 (low vs. high level of involvement with the topic) X 2 (physical vs. social threat) X 2 (within-subject pretest vs. posttest) X 4 (four countries) mixed repeated-measures design. Participants in the experiment were first pre-screened for their age and nationality. Pretest questionnaires were distributed to the participants recruited for the study. To qualify for the experiment, the participants had to be between the ages of 18 and 25, and they had to be citizens of Malaysia, Singapore, England, and the U.S., respectively. Of the 911 college students who participated in the pretest, a total of 700 students completed the experiment and posttest. Regardless of message condition, country, and time, participants with high level of involvement with the topic all reported greater perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived response efficacy, intention to use condoms, condom interpersonal impact, knowledge about gonorrhea scores, fear arousal, and perceived content learning, but lower scores for message reactance and defensive avoidance than participants with low level of involvement. Participants with high level of involvement with the topic also had greater increase in posttest scores for perceived susceptibility, perceived response efficacy, perceived self-efficacy, intention to use condoms, and condom self-control than participants with low level of involvement."

However, over the past few years, the influx of reality TV in primetime programming has been highly reflective of its expansion in formats, evident from the variety of narrative structures and themes embedded in reality-based shows. This study redefines this entertainment genre and provides a richer conceptualization of reality TV by examining nine subgenres: dating/romance, makeover/lifestyle, hidden camera, talent, game show, docusoap, sitcom, law enforcement, and court. An online questionnaire revealed significant differences in self-reported character identification, interactivity, enjoyment, perceived realism, and perceived competition across these subgenres. Findings not only suggest that programs commonly defined as reality TV offer different experiences for viewers, but also provide strong support for its growing diversity of formats, as well as a reconceptualization of this TV genre."

This paper analyzes the ways in which the Israeli mainstream press utilized these characteristics of the ICP in order to dialectically confirm the moral superiority, historical inevitability, and ideological cohesiveness of hegemonic Zionism over the first three decades of Israels existence. By portraying the ICP as treacherous, irrational, dogmatic, violent, and passive, Zionism was shown to be patriotic, logical, pragmatic, peaceful, and active. By focusing on the ICPs support of Arab interests, Zionism became reduced to its nationalistic components, at the expense of the socialist ideals supposedly embraced earlier. The implications of these findings for the role of the media in the construction of collective identity and the exclusion of marginalized social groups are discussed."

Green, many hoped, would be the man to institutionalize the reform so sorely needed by the police department defined by brutality and corruption. Greens decision to appoint former television journalist Don Fair to the newly created post of public information officer of the PPD in 1980 seemed a step in the right direction  a move to establish a formal mouthpiece for the department and refashion its image.

This paper examines these struggles by exploring the social and cultural implications Fairs appointment held for the police department and for Philadelphias city government."
2006-1120,Reframing as a Career Strategy in Emotional Labor,Organizing Emotions,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Reframing as a Career Strategy in Emotional Labor,Organizing Emotions,"Based on extensive literature review of career development, emotional labor, and dialectic theories, this paper has illustrated three potential ways to deal with emotional labor that is part of many peoples career and offered an analysis of how emotional laborers can creatively construct the meaning of work and career happiness out of the self-serving nature. Practical implications are discussed for career training as well. Specially, it suggests that reframing, refocusing, and integrating conflicts can potentially serve as coping strategies to enhance positive career experience for people engaging in emotional labor. The propositions in this paper have some practical implications for career training of emotional workers as well. That is, it is not sufficient for managers and trainers to require workers to display some positive attitudes. Behind the emotional display of a positive attitude, there are communicative choices, sense making, and self-persuasion. Therefore, employers need to pay attention to the internal meaning construction process involved in emotional labor."
2006-1121,Reframing Rural America,Framing Effects,Political Communication,,,Paper,Reframing Rural America,Framing Effects,"This paper examines the way frames about rural America might be changed to increase support for a new policy agenda. The current frames around rural America, tend to portray it as place of simple, hard-working, virtuous people in a bucolic natural setting (Aubrun & Grady, 2004). Once we understand the dominant frame, it is possible to test alternative frames and to engage in reframing to change the existing pattern of discourse. The research was designed to test how support for a new rural policy agenda varies when different elements of the frame are introduced. A within-subjects experiment, using a 3,105-subject telephone survey, was designed. Support for a new rural agenda was measured after the introduction of three new frame values, fairness, cooperation and interdependence. Additionally, the research also explored how geographic location might vary levels of support for a new rural agenda. One key finding was that when individuals were exposed to the fairness and interdependence values within the frame, their support for a new rural policy agenda was greater than the control group. Support for the rural policy agenda did vary by the respondents geographic area and the frame applied. This research provides guidance for rural advocates seeking to change the current policy discussion through reframing rural issues. Successful rural frames will illuminate fairness in addressing rural concerns, and will build on geographic interdependence to connect all people to these issues, wherever they live."
2006-1122,Regionalization of East Asian Television Programs: Examining the Popularity of Contempoary Korean Television Dramas in East Asia,ternational Television Flows,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Regionalization of East Asian Television Programs: Examining the Popularity of Contempoary Korean Television Dramas in East Asia,International Television Flows,"This study advances that cultural imperialism is no longer applicable in examining complex and dynamic regionalized Asian media. Instead, the cultural proximity provides better explanations for Asian media regionalization. However, the cultural proximity claimed by Straubhaar does not thoroughly present the discursive and transformative nature of Asian cultural proximity in terms of the historical context of Asian modernity and the global capitalism. Consequently, there is a distinctive growing regional pattern in East Asian television. The regionalization of East Asian television suggests that cultural proximity among East Asian audiences is not only in terms of geographical intimacy but also of sharing emotive code with regard to Asian urbanism and modernity experience. Particularly, the popularity of Korean TV dramas referred to as Hanliu in Asia is revealed this cultural proximity among East Asian audiences. Korean TV dramas convey an understandable social and individual life of the young generation, the value of family, and the urbanized capitalism."
2006-1123,Regulation of Online Child Pornography Under European Union and American Law.,National Regulation in an International World,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,Regulation of Online Child Pornography Under European Union and American Law.,National Regulation in an International World,"Rapidly evolving and converging information and communication technologies have made the Internet a platform for the dissimulation and dissemination of child pornography at the global level. This article compares and contrasts the regulation of online child pornography under European Union and American law. Under European Union law, online child pornography is regulated as illegal material that violates human rights. In the United States, online child pornography and computer-generated child pornography is material that is regulated within the ambit of the niceties of speech under First Amendment. The result is that the European Unions content-based framework criminalizes all child pornographyreal or computer-generatedwhile the United States criminalizes only child pornography featuring real children. The controversial United States Supreme Court ruling in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, which decriminalized computer-generated child pornography, coupled with the failure of the United States to accede to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, makes the country the weakest link in international efforts to eradicate online child pornography."

The European concept of PSB as a comprehensive and universal service is challenged by both EU and national authorities at three levels: 1) mission and program task (comprehensive or complementary programming?), 2) organization (central organization or distributed public service?) and 3) financing (license fee, advertising or state aid?). There are pressures towards a more pure model of public service broadcasting and/or towards de-institutionalization of PSB and distributed public service. Recent pleadings for (e.g., in the Netherlands) and practices (e.g., in New Zealand) of new PSB policy directions will be evaluated. The paper deals with the question whether the European full-fledged PSB model is still realistic or a more small-scale public service a la the American PBS would be a more viable prospect."

A possible dark side of commitment lies in the way that commitment can actually constrain and challenge communication in romantic relationships. Data used to illuminate the possible dark side of commitment was collected in an extensive qualitative research project in Puerto Rico: Forty-two in-depth interviews were conducted with men and womenranging in age from 18 to 56regarding communication about sex in relationships. Because the timing of sex and commitment often do not coincide, this disjuncture in the development of relationships can limit future discourse. We contend that commitment is not the panacea for relational happiness (including sexual satisfaction) that it appears."

The results largely supported an interactional explanation to group communication and dominance perceptions. First, collocated participants sent more equalizing and weakly submissive messages than distributed participants, suggesting that collocated groups exchanged more moderate messages. Second, dominance perceptions were systematically predicted by relational control moves. Perceptions were most affected by strongly dominant, equalizing, and weakly submissive moves, all of which enhanced perceptions of dominance. Third, relational symmetry between group members was also affected by relational control moves. Relational symmetry was enhanced with fewer weakly dominant messages and more equalizing messages. Taken together, these results support interactional approaches to computer-mediated communication and provide a behavioral explanation for the increased intensity frequently observed in the interpersonal perceptions of distributed groups."

Linking the resource-based view (RBV) from strategy literature with relationship management theory in public relations, the study explored relationships as organizational resources and examined their contribution to strategy implementation.
Thirty-two interviews were conducted with both public relations managers and strategy managers in China. Findings supported major theoretical propositions. Relationships were found to possess key features identified in literature for resources that lead to competitive advantages: valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and hard to be substituted. Findings suggested that relationships contributed to strategy implementation in general. More specifically, relationships were also used to achieve a fit with different strategies, another key assumption in RBV.
Drawing on the paired input from public relations and strategic planning, this study empirically examined the oft-ignored link between these functions, thus contributing to the understanding in public relations value, strategic management, and relationship development."

Some 134 employees of various civil engineering companies in South Korea completed a questionnaire. The findings showed that LMX quality, social cost, and source credibility independently or jointly influenced subordinates feedback seeking behaviors. Preference for using the tactic of directly asking was substantially associated with LMX quality of relationship whereas preferences for using the tactics of indirectly asking and asking third party were not related to LMX quality. The negative relationship between LMX and preferences for indirect tactic is strengthened by source credibility. Finally the negative relationship between LMX and preferences for asking third party is strengthened by source credibility. Implications and limitations were discussed."

Six variables were tested: conflict frame, violence, religion's relationship to violence, discrimination, intolerance, and conflict with the legal system. The English-language newspapers shared remarkably similar values when it came to associating Islam with conflict and violent, but significant differences arose in the French and Turkish newspapers, especially in their reporting on Christianity."
2006-1131,Religion As Social Ontology: The Muslim Immigrant In (Danish) Public Discourse,dentity and Spheres of Difference,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Religion As Social Ontology: The Muslim Immigrant In (Danish) Public Discourse,Identity and Spheres of Difference,"This paper argues, in line with post-structuralist thought, for Islam to be understood as an empty category, the content of which is filled associatively in the course of a discursive articulation. 2. As an empty signifier with no determinate meaning, it functions as the signifier of a fundamental antagonism between traditional cultures (backwardness) and Western socities (modernity) in discursive articulations. In this sense, what Islam signifies is not a particular religion but religion itself thus secularizing Christianity. The struggle for hegemony is the struggle for how this empty category should be overdetermined, that is, colored by a particular signification. The paper illustrates this point with an analysis of newspaper coverage of Islam in the US and Denmark and of qualitative interviews with ordinary Danes.
The second part of my argument is that hegemonic articulations are the result of discursive interventions that set up specific antagonisms according to which membership of identity categories are made meaningful and have an explanatory power for the social world. In modern times, opinion polls play a great role in fixing, however temporarly, the meaning of categories. It also directs the medias respond to particular communications via their institutional and daily routines, professional ideologies, and their embeddedness in the ideological environment within which public debate is conducted."

The re-imagining and retelling of these cultural narratives over time may play a part in altering the ingredients of social memory and complicating or reinforcing the frameworks that audiences have established for understanding and contextualizing these events. I argue that disaster texts may 1) build national identity through their function as commemoration 2) alter the ingredients of social memory through the generation of simulacra. In the case of 9/11, the texts create a dramatic construction of events that went unwitnessed, in which inference substitutes for experience and is granted legitimacy as history through the documentary form 3) legitimate some disasters and not others 4) produce countermemory through omission and framing decisions and 5) promote a fatalistic worldview in which disasters are presented as inevitable and void of political and social implications. Finally, as way of remembering, disaster narratives also perform a range of ideological functionsThey reassert patriarchal and ethnocentric worldviews, define what constitutes history, reproduce capitalism and values of progress and the work ethic, simultaneously promote and warn against forms of authoritarianism and define what constitutes citizenship, reproducing nationalism during moments of national trauma. Since these cultural narratives and myths can be mobilized to serve political ends, our understanding of how these texts may work to shape social memory and ideological positionings vis-à-vis national disasters is crucial."

To apply these theories and test the effect of name-based ethnic stereotypes on housing discrimination, an experiment was conducted on the Internet over a period of 10 weeks (6 weeks before the conflict with Iraq began in March, 2003 and 4 weeks during the conflict), in which 1115 inquiry email messages were sent to landlords who were advertising apartment vacancies in Los Angeles County. One of three names that implied either Arab, African American, or White ethnicity was randomly assigned to each of the 1115 messages sent. The results show that the African American and Arab names receive significantly fewer positive responses than the White name, and that the African American fares worst of all. This pattern holds true in all rent categories, in corporate and privately owned apartment complexes, and before and during the war in Iraq."

It argues that forms of play and performance in the pedagogical and community initiatives and the literary and video production of the Committee constitute an important tool for lesbians to come into public visibility. The performative dimension of their work incorporates and reworks the representations and aesthetics strategies of global infotainment media and nationalistic discourses alike. In this, play performativity constitute an important connection with the identity politics of American and Western European lesbian groups."

She questioned on the driven force and the formation of the radical anti-Japanese sentiments among todays Chinese youth. Based on six in-depth interviews, the author found that the Chinese youths nationalist sentiments cannot be comfortably explained by the theoretical framework offered either by the state-led or the populist nationalism approaches. The author further argued that nationalism is not invoked and presented in a homogeneous way, neither is national identity. In fact, the Chinese youth selectively used the scant contents from the Internet or their friends as evidences to support their imaginations on Japan and Japanese. At the same time, they refused to take the rich contents conveyed through states educational systems and mass media seriously. The author concluded that, being othered by the larger society simply provides the Chinese youth opportunities to take on their group identity, a badge of pride, and to collectively resist the orthodox discourses and practices on nationalism."

The findings show that distinctiveness, transparency, and consistency are the principles guiding corporations in reaching quality reputation. In addition to the original dimensions of Fombrums reputation quotients (emotional appeal, products and services, financial performance, vision and leadership, workplace environment, and social responsibility), interviewees revealed media recognition and business ethics should be incorporated to the Hong Kong context."

Swedish research on organizational communication is characterized by empirical, qualitative research. The tradition of holistic and profound case studies is strong. In this paper, a wide definition of organizational communication is employed, including research focusing on both internal and external communication. Research themes and methods are reviewed and discussed. The majority of the studies concern public information, including health communication and crisis communication. Particularly, scholars have studied planning and evaluation of information campaigns concerning health, traffic and environment; and more recently, authority communication during major crises in society. Research focusing on organizations internal communication includes topics such as superior-subordinate communication, organizational learning, sense making, communication strategies and communication efficiency.
Strengths and weaknesses following from this empirical case study research tradition are highlighted. Finally, the contribution of Swedish research in an international perspective is discussed.

The data generated five intriguing findings. (1) The Chinese are more interdependent than Canadians but less so than Indians. In other words, China has emerged as a middle land, indicating that the Chinese culture has changed to a more individualistic entity. (2) The Canadians are more independent than the Chinese in six relationship dimensions, but are as interdependent as the Chinese in self-closest friend connectedness. This finding somewhat contradicts one assumption of the theories of independent-interdependent self-construal and I-C. (3) Canadians are more independent than Indians in all seven relationship dimensions, providing strong support for theories of independent-interdependent self-construal and I-C. (4) Chinese are as interdependent as Indians in terms of self-closest family member and self-close-family-members connectedness, and self-other relatives but more independent than Indians in the other four categories of self-other relationships. (5) Participants age did not have strong correlations with variables measuring self-construal in any of the three samples, indicating that a persons attachment style may not change greatly over a life-span. Theoretical and methodological implications of the findings are also discussed."

The question of the communication competence of leaders is not a new one, but none-theless there has not been very much research directed to this area. On the contrary, leadership is often viewed as an inherent trait, rather than a set of competencies that can be developed. This paper describes how leadership can be viewed from a communication competence viewpoint. The purpose of the paper is to answer the question: what kind of communication competence is demanded from leaders in a knowledge-based organization?
In this study 11 leaders of a Finnish knowledge-based research and development (R&D) organization were interviewed. The data gathered in the interviews was analyzed using cross-case analysis. Opinions and experiences as to leadership and the communication competence of leaders vary considerably, but according to the interviewed leaders it plays a critical role in their work, especially when facing the challenges arising from a dynamic environment or when working in a knowledge-based organization. In conclusion, the preliminary analysis explains leadership from a communication competence viewpoint in the context of the present-day working life."

These effects may be moderated by speakers delivering the rhetorical devices. We examined the immediate effects of rhetorical devices or persons on newscast viewers. In three sessions, 53 participants indicated their captivation while viewing nine minutes of a Dutch newscast. This was registered continuously (moment-to-moment) by means of an electronic device. The results were combined with a content analysis for the talking heads and the rhetorical devices in their speech. Rhetorical devices and persons were related to viewer captivation in a time series analysis. Results show that both talking heads and rhetorical devices can positively and negatively affect captivation. Analysis of the effects reveals that delivery of rhetorical devices plays an important role. A talking heads intonation and formulation is better or worse, prepared or spontaneous, and other program elements may bias the effects."

Through discourse and textual analysis, this project investigates the ways in which media agents reported on instances of resistance to dominant ideology. Newspaper articles described in the paper reveal specific themes in the coverage, and were selected because they were published during the course of or following the event and because they are representative of common themes appearing in many articles published in response to the occupation. By unveiling the formulas employed by reporters throughout the event, the project informs existing scholarship with a more empirical review of the tendencies of press systems in covering social movements and provides suggestions for media reform and literacy."

Role schema refers to knowledge about social roles which denote sets of behaviors expected of people in particular social positions. The ascribed role schemas including race, gender, and age are routinely and automatically used in creating image of others and are dimensions that people consistently use to categorize others. When one adopts a particular role to understand others, that categorization becomes an organizing schema and forms a role-relevant image. However, schemas are not always the same: one of the most important assumptions of schemas is that an environmental change elicits a change in schemas. This study attempted to know: (1) What role schemas Japanese employees have toward host country employees in Malaysia, the Philippines, China, and the U.S. and vice versa; and (2) How their role schemas have changed over time. The results showed that the participants image toward their counterparts have changed over time, the attached feelings to the images became more positive with more frequent communication, and they had more positive feelings when they were more satisfied with their job."

Tatar? American? Formation, Communication, and Maintenance of Ethnic Identity Among Russian Tatars Living in the United States",From the Local to the Transnational: Theorizing Discourses of Identity in the Era of Globalization,"Most of the worlds ethnic Tatars live in Tatarstan, a former Soviet Republic and an autonomous state in Russia today. Once an independent Muslim nation, Tatarstan was conquered by the Russian Tsar, Ivan IV (a.k.a. Ivan the Terrible) in 1552. For centuries, the relationship between Russians and Tatars has been complex. The collapse of the former Soviet Union introduced a new dynamic into Russian-Tatar relations. The possibility for Russian Tatars to travel aboard, to meet members of the Tatar Diaspora, and to observe the rights that ethnic minorities enjoy overseas resulted in a strong desire among Russian Tatars, those living in Russia and abroad, to revise their political, socioeconomic and cultural status within Russia.

In this study, I will examine how Russian Tatars living in the United States define, communicate, and maintain their ethnic identity. As my research data, I will use messages posted on an online forum Tatar USA between January 2005 and 2006. The Tatar USA forum is part of the Tatars in America website (www.tatar-usa.org), created by a group of young Russian Tatars who arrived in the United States as students or employees within the last ten years and have been living in America since then.

By employing grounded theory in my study of ethnic identity among Russian Tatars living in the United States  participants of the online forum Tatar USA  I hope to identify a central descriptive narrative of the Tatar ethnic identity, as it is expressed, communicated, and maintained by the forum participants."

The term is elusive in that this phenomenon seems to correspond more to the impressive effort of film production and profitability in a country economically overwhelmed, than to an ideological, technological, or aesthetic trend. The purpose of this study is to define Mexican New Cinema and to identify distinguishing narrational procedures and metaphors of Mexican identity construction in MNC discourses after the political divide in year 2000. This year coincides with both the change in government after 70 years of one ruling party and the beginning of a recovering, though uneven, film production. Previous studies concerning representations and stereotyping of Mexicans in cinema were conducted before MNC emerged. They form part of general histories of Mexican cinema written by both Mexican and foreign historians, critics, and scholars concerned with the evolution of genres and representations of Mexicans from the 1890s to the 1980s. Drawing from the circuit of culture model described by Paul du Gay and colleagues, this discourse analysis will identify the distinguishing narrational procedures and metaphors of Mexican identity construction in Mexican New Cinema discourses from 2000 to 2004. The purposive sample will include the semiotic analysis of 10 films produced by the public and the private sector, and 20 long interviews with producers, directors, and screenwriters directly involved in their production."

These problems include two types: 1) pornographic content posted on the web and 2) pedophiles stalking children on the web.
The third-person effect, as hypothesized by W. Phillips Davison (1983), may be contributing to the problems. Third-person effect is the perception that other people are more affected by media messages, especially negative elements, than the individual observers themselves. The third-person effect can argue why public schools need to come to terms with the new and potentially harmful effects from which the children they educate about computers need to be protected. This study, therefore, will address school district public relations personnels knowledge of potential Internet harms, any concerns they might have regarding students use of the Internet, where the information regarding those concerns originated, and any behavior that has been taken by their districts as a result of those concerns."
2006-1164,Science Fiction Cinema and the Semantics of Posterity,Theory Development for Visual Analysis,Visual Studies,,,Paper,Science Fiction Cinema and the Semantics of Posterity,Theory Development for Visual Analysis,"In the second half of the XXth century, the semantics of posterity underwent a dramatic transformation, manifest in the notion of future generations. Ushered in by environmentalist discourse, this construct has gained an outstanding presence in the public realm, as much as it implies the idea of the moral responsibility for the long term consequences of our actions, a responsibility focused on our descendants. This new understanding of the future being this moral point of view a temporal point of view  has inspired a copious literature about its legal and politic implications; although little has been said of the social and cultural circumstances which influenced in its genesis. In this study we turn to science fiction cinema to highlight the making of that category. This genre appears suitable for this research because one of its main themes concerns the relationships between contemporary people and future Humanity. Interpretating the findings of film analysis on a constructivist approach, we reconstruct the intellectual drift of this category since its appearance in the Fifties and how it was shaped by the societal need of an external point of view upon which risk observations can be based."

Little is known about the attitudes and propensities of the men who bug chase, save for their most conspicuous behavior, an active desire to voluntarily contract HIV. This paper exposes these unknown attributes through analyzing how Chasers advertise and self-present. Drawn from a barebacking website, three-hundred online advertisements created by gay men were analyzed. As predicted, a group of Bug Chasers could be identified within the ads that differed from Barebackers in their preference for a serodiscordant partner and a willingness to engage in risky behaviors. As anticipated, two subgroups were found within the bug chasing profiles, those who were fluke and those who were serial chasers. Overall, the data indicated that Bug Chasers were more likely than Barebackers to market themselves as sexual subordinates, engage in passive sexual fetishes and advertise membership to the Crystal Meth culture."
2006-1166,"Searching Google News: Interactivity, Emotion, and the Moderating Role of Internet Self-Efficacy",Determinants of Online Search Behavior,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,"Searching Google News: Interactivity, Emotion, and the Moderating Role of Internet Self-Efficacy",Determinants of Online Search Behavior,"Technology researchers rarely assess the impact of individual differences on user responses to search engine use. Empirical studies that have been conducted yield inconsistent results. Recently, scholars have found that the relationship between Web use and its effects is contingent on Internet experience. We argue that Internet self-efficacy, developed from a foundation of social cognitive theory rather than confidence studies, represents a useful discriminating measure of motivation and competency and moderates the relationship between Web search tasks and psychological responses to search engine use. Previous studies have employed Internet self-efficacy to predict Internet use and motivation but rarely situate this important measure as a moderator variable that influences online outcomes. The findings of an original experiment testing the effects of search engine responsiveness on users of Google News show that for people with high Internet self-efficacy, varying the degree of search term specificity and search result density produces a threshold effect, whereas for users with low Internet self-efficacy, the number of search results and search terms is either not associated or negatively correlates with search-related outcomes."

In addition, the study also examines the relationship between information seeking and satisfaction with that information search process. The secondary data analysis utilizes a sub-sample of 745 cancer patients available through the National Cancer Institutes Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) to test the hypotheses and the overall fit of the model. This study differs from previous research in two ways: first, it focuses on the online cancer information seeking behavior of clinically diagnosed cancer patients; second, it examines the antecedents of and satisfactions derived from online cancer information seeking using a structural equation model. The model had an acceptable fitness to the sub-sample of the HINTS data, though most of the health-related factors did not predict using the Internet to seek cancer information significantly. Several empirically based modifications to the model are offered"

A telephone survey was conducted among Chinese migrants in Singapore, to explore the nature of CMSS and identify the factors that affect CMSS seeking. Four types of CMSS are observed - informational, emotional, tangible, and companionship support. Among them, informational CMSS is most needed and sought by migrants. The data also reveal that international migrants actively seek CMSS, which in effect becomes an efficient and valuable supplement to their traditional (or offline, compared with CMSS in the online environment) social support. Moreover, the CMSS seeking behavior varies in different migration periods, and with different availabilities of traditional social support and the levels of satisfaction on CMSS."

Unprecedented search and filtering capabilities facilitated by new information technologies mean that individuals decisions regarding their information exposure are more important than ever. This paper presents data from two interconnected projects to address the selective exposure question. The first project uses data collected in a national random-digit-dial telephone survey (n=1,510) to examine how Americans use the control afforded by the Internet to shape their overall exposure to political information. The second project uses data collected in a web-administered experiment conducted with a national sample of partisan news readers (n=727) to study subjects use of individual news items. The results suggest that though people are drawn to viewpoint-supporting information, they do not systematically exclude contact with other viewpoints. People use online sources to increase their repertoire of opinion-supporting arguments, and they exhibit greater interest in news items with which they agree. On the other hand, though online news users are selective about which opinion-contrary news items they consider, the bias is slight and is partially offset by longer read times. Overall, online newsreaders experienced no overall drop in familiarity with other perspectives."

However, it unclear the degree to which watching the television network influenced credibility judgments. Those who had watched Al-Jazeera consistently judged it more credible than nonviewers, although relationships became insignificant after controlling for demographic, political and cultural variables."
2006-1171,Self as a Social Construct: The Emergent Self in Bollywood Cinema,From Asia to the World: Globalization within and through Popular Communication,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Self as a Social Construct: The Emergent Self in Bollywood Cinema,From Asia to the World: Globalization within and through Popular Communication,The paper is a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding what is happening to identities and sense of self-hood in the contemporary era of global cultural and economic exchanges. Sociologists contend that sense of selfhood and Self as a concept is increasingly beleaguered and probably dysfunctional in the post-modern world where it is assuaged by multiple choices to define and create selfhood. The paper argues that perhaps this is not so. If the sense of self is a process and not a destination then built into the flexibility of the process is its inherent sustainability. It illustrates this through example from popular cinema from one of the most static cultures in the world - India (which only of late is confronted with alternatives to the dominant order). Self is able to keep its coherence by toying with new alternatives and internalizing those that are not in open opposition to the old. It is a very active process of creation and perhaps Self is more alive today then ever before.
2006-1172,Self as Source: Agency and Customization in Interactive Media Top Paper (3),Online Self-Disclosure,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Self as Source: Agency and Customization in Interactive Media Top Paper (3),Online Self-Disclosure,"This paper argues that the most seductive aspect of modern communication technologies is not simply their interactivity, navigability, or multimodality, but rather their potential for customization by imbuing a richer sense of agency amongst users. Increasingly, the communication receiver serves as the gatekeeper of information (ipod; myyahoo.com) and even as a provider of information (blogs; wikipedia.com). Theoretical implications of such a move towards self as source are explored from two perspectivestechnological and psychological. Rationale is presented for considering interactivity as a source (not just a message) feature that is ontologically responsible for creating unique individual experiences of mediated content. The psychological importance of such a technological development is demonstrated by reviewing findings from a recent set of CAT division papers. Finally, a new theoretical model, highlighting the importance of self as source as a crucial mediator between technological antecedents and psychological consequences, is proposed for future testing."

Personal blog publishing has been rarely studied because of its relative recentness, so has the visual components of blogging. This study analyzes photoblogging as a way of socio-communicative interaction, focusing on college students blog use in South Korea. The patterns and motivations of photoblogging are described. The associations of photoblogging with individual traitlike characteristicsself-consciousness (public and private) and socio-communicative orientation (responsiveness and assertiveness) are further examined. Lastly, discussion about this new trend of online interaction and the limitation of this study is provided."

Interpersonal communication experts should be concerned with the credibility of these self-help authors and what advice is dispensed. Study one of this paper involved an examination of the qualifications of 31 popular self-help authors in relational communication. The results revealed that although many authors had earned Ph.D.s, none had degrees in communication and most had not published any empirical research. Study two analyzed fourteen books for their content and the type of evidence used. Five common themes were revealed including using a banking analogy, dividing couples into types, elaborating on a series of steps for the strategies offered, referring to childhood as a cause for current relational problems, and offering exercises to implement the strategies offered. Most authors relied solely on anecdotal evidence for their claims. Implications for future research in the area of interpersonal communication are discussed."

As predicted by the activation model of media exposure, the results show that the association between the variable emotional arousal elicited by the items and liking of the items takes the shape of an inverted U. However, the effect of sensationalist features on the level of emotional arousal and the degree to which an item is liked, is rather limited. The inclusion of a dramatic subject in an item and the increase in the number of camera shots appear to have the largest effects on both variables."

(Top Faculty Paper)",Assessing News Credibility,"In a cross-market examination of newspaper accuracy, this study tracks errors identified by news sources in 2,700 news stories published by U.S. daily metropolitan newspapers. While journalists widely hold that errors are commonly detected and corrected, this study found that only about one in ten news sources had informed the newspaper of the errors they perceived. While many errors were considered too inconsequential to correct, news sources also expressed a sense of futility  that a correction would do little to set the record straight, or worse, that their complaints would either be ignored or draw reprisal from the newspaper. Results tentatively indicate that factual errors reported by news sources to the offending newspaper rarely yielded published corrections. The findings challenge how well the ""corrections box"" sets the record straight when inaccuracies occur or serves in journalism as a safety valve for the venting of frustrations by wronged news sources."

We predicted that a high level of sexualized talk and concentration on the body would occur in the coverage. Our findings did not support these specific predictions in the area of play-by-play commentary in that we found the commentary concentrated on the domination and athleticism of the female athletes. However, an analysis of the visual coverage of the games confirms that sex and sexuality were used to not only promote the athletes but to sell the sport to viewers around the world. For example, when the Walsh/May team beat Brazil in the final, they embraced one another and fell on top of one another in the sand. The win meant standing atop the gold medal podium; yet, the commentary and the specific video used (and rebroadcast) used of this specific moment deemphasized the athletic feat and focused on the sexual nature of the shot. Despite there being a great deal of video and digital images to choose from, all which would tell the story of the win, several media outlets chose to use the images that did not emphasize the athletes strength, athleticism, or power, rather their ability to become a sexual object. Overall, we found audio coverage of the womens beach volleyball games to contradict the visual representation of the female athletes and their games. These and other findings are discussed."

The presented articles featured the same portions of social/interpersonal and achievement/performance topics with equally positive and negative news, while personae gender was counterbalanced. Newsreaders selective news exposure was unobtrusively logged. Results show that, in line with gender stereotypes, women favor social/interpersonal topics and men prefer achievement/performance issues. Newsreaders affiliation motivation, gender-role orientation, and self-esteem influenced what news content was preferred."

Men who played the sexually explicit video game recognized words with sexual connotations and words describing women as sex objects more quickly than did men in the control conditions. Men who played the sexually explicit game also displayed an increased tendency to engage in sexual harassment compared to men who played non-sexual video games. The anticipated interaction between sex-typing and the sexually explicit video game condition was not found. Overall, the study provides strong empirical evidence that a sexually explicit video game with themes of female objectification may prime thoughts related to sex, encourage men to view women as sex objects, and increase the likelihood of self reported tendencies to behave inappropriately toward women in social situations."

It reports findings from the 2001-02 television season and from the 2004-05 season, allowing for an over time comparison. Results indicate that in both seasons, these programs contained a large amount of sexual content, though the frequency of such messages decreased over time. Most messages were in the form of conversations about sex, followed by the portrayal of precursory sexual behaviors, and finally sexual intercourse portrayals. Sexual intercourse was most often portrayed as taking place between adults who have an established relationship. Sexual risk and responsibility concerns were rarely depicted in either of the samples, but were more likely to occur in shows with intercourse-related content. Most consequences for sexual intercourse that teenagers were likely to encounter in 2004-05 were negative, a significant change from the pattern observed in 2001-02."

Do fear appeals work? This study explores whether efficacy measures (self-efficacy and response efficacy) have stronger associations with intention than do threat measures (personal risk estimates and severity) in response to a health threat originated in Asia. Moreover, this study assesses whether response alternatives affect the association of threat- and coping appraisal variables with intentions. Results show that there was a positive linear association between the threat/coping appraisals and intention. However, no significant difference in the strength of associations between threat- and coping-appraisal variables and behavioral intention was observed."
2006-1208,"Shared Decision Making, Quality of Care, and the Healthcare Relationship",Client-Provider Communication II: Achieving Quality Outcomes,Health Communication,,,Paper,"Shared Decision Making, Quality of Care, and the Healthcare Relationship",Client-Provider Communication II: Achieving Quality Outcomes,"The relationship between patient and provider has become the subject of considerable work by healthcare services researchers. Studies have shown that active participation by consumers has a beneficial influence on healthcare decisions. Results are less about whether and how shared decision making leads to better treatment outcomes, and even about the preference of patients to defer to the judgments of practitioners rather than collaborating on treatment decisions. This paper advances the claim that shared decision can be justified principally by its relationship to quality of care. This claim is advanced by discussing the problem of uncertaintyhow it affects quality of care, how uncertainty has been addressed through the tradition of decision making, and how this tradition has influenced healthcare practice. An established theory is presented that regards shared decision making as an interpersonal transaction between provider and patient. This transaction is essentially a meeting ground of unequal agents, with each party having a distinctive expertise. The theory is utilized to advance an empirically testable model of the relationship between shared decision making and quality of care. It is suggested that quality lies in responsiveness to uncertainty and that shared decision promotes quality of care by facilitating responsiveness."

It illustrates, using several examples, that the public media can participate very actively in the intercultural dialogue  between the so-called majority group in society and the minority groups, be they national, ethnic or languages groups. The media can be helpful in constructing what Fred Casmir called the third culture. This meeting of two different cultures  in this case the culture of the majority of society and the culture of minority groups, shapes the third form  sphere, which is oriented on cooperation. The stress was put on the function of the public media in Polish society, where national and ethnic groups make up around 3% of the population. But Poland is condemned to being a multicultural country as an European Union member state. In this process the media has a significant role to play."

Essential aspects of PDP models were discussed with regard to mental representation constructs during comprehension. Re-conceptualization of comprehension processes, activation propagation computation, and PDP network operation were disused. Using a short story, we developed a network to illustrate how a PDP models based model works. The designed network was simulated in software and the resulting output activations turned out to be significantly correlated to empirical free recall data. Throughout the paper, the potential advantages of the PDP models both for research method and a theoretical guidance of comprehension processes, were emphasized with an expectation to facilitate scholarly interests in the PDP models in mass media message comprehension."
2006-1212,Situational Factors and Facework Influence as a Secondary Goal,fluence in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,Situational Factors and Facework Influence as a Secondary Goal,Influence in Interpersonal Relationships,"People perceived that there would be more risks limiting the targets freedom (negative face threats) when situations are illegitimate, for instance, having low rights to ask, expecting higher resistance by the target, and being less close with the target (H1). This explained why people were likely to select the goal of managing owns impression and the goal of managing others impression to redress this risk (H2). Consequently if messages of compliance seekers addressed the risk and supported the negative face of the target, then compliance would be more successful controlling for persuasiveness and compliance in the illegitimate situations (H7). Furthermore, when certain situations were perceived as more concerning about the positive face of the source (RQ), the observational data revealed that sources messages would engage in more face support toward the source in those situations (in this study, the legitimate condition compared with the illegitimate condition) (H4)."

In this article, I discuss three active ways in which teenage girls and boys from diverse ethnic backgrounds interpret this soap, using the concept of performative style to analyse the results of twenty focus group interviews. One performative style revolves around questions of morality and sex, one focuses on specific characters, and one looks at the soap as a whole. By employing these performative styles in talking about the soap, young people construct a particular set of performances of the self. Rather than being influenced by the characters, storylines and representations of the soap, they use them for their own purposes. Gender and ethnicity play an important role in the way in which these performative styles are used."

Research for this paper attempted to determine whether there is a difference in media frames between newspapers of different ideologies in the coverage of the tobacco issue. The examination of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal showed that, while the New York Times became less supportive of the tobacco industry over time, the Wall Street Journal was consistent in its coverage of the tobacco industry. The Wall Street Journal downplayed the adverse economic impact of the Surgeon General's report in 1964. Again in the 1998 Minnesota trial, the Wall Street Journal framed the state as gaining an upper hand over the tobacco industry."

In Indonesia, the 30-year Suharto regime ended, adding political uncertainty and civil service disruption to that countrys woes. One of the worlds most successful long term family planning and population management programs faced disaster as the cost of contraceptives increased and access to supplies and services decreased. But the disaster never happened and contraceptive prevalence actually rose during this period. What explains this resilience? Using data from large national demographic and health surveys (n=21,000) at two points in time, we test the hypotheses that contraceptive use remained stable due to entrenched social norms favoring family planning and communication around those normsin other words, a supportive symbolic environmentreflected in factors such as interpersonal communication with ones spouse, approval of family planning and desire for small families at the aggregate level. Second, we hypothesize that exposure to family planning messages, also at the aggregate level, strengthens the small family contraceptive adoption ethos, thus contributing to the stability of contraceptive use."

Specifically, it explored the influence of societal culture, organizational culture, and the interaction between the two, on the development of relations between multinational companies and their local employees.
Fifty nine interviews were conducted with both employee relations managers and general employees in China. Findings revealed the influence of Chinese societal culture in 1) respecting traditions and customs; 2) strong family orientation; 3) relational reciprocity; and 4) individualism/collectivism. Organizational culture influenced relationship cultivation strategies, types of relations, and relational outcomes. The interaction between societal and organizational cultures was not clear-cut, but found to be influenced by additional factors such as globalization strategies of companies and the styles of general managers.
Using responses from both parties in the same relationship, this study provided a comprehensive picture of how employees relations was conducted under the complex influences of different cultures at different levels."

Applying concepts of open access policy to the emerging technology of DMB, this paper attempts to gain a better understanding of how DMB will evolve and stabilize in next generation network environments. Three research questions guide this study: (1) How does DMB trigger a change in policy, market and industry structure? (2) What are the driving forces of the rapid DMB development in Korea? As these questions involve socio-technical issues, this study uses a socio-technical perspective to investigate the complex relations between social and technical aspects of DMB by highlighting the co-evolving nature, diversity, and interface, which constitute the next generation network environment. The finding is that Korean DMB is the outcome of aggressive strategy of telecom carrier and the Korean governments industrial policy to support such strategy. Amongst the push-oriented trajectory, non-technical issues such as users, market and regulation are left behind, which reveals the disjunction of the DMB development in terms of socio-technical system perspective. The development of DMB involves the dynamics of industry, regulation, and technology."

As interest in the Hispanic market has increased so has the research involved in trying to understand the ways in which Hispanics can be effectively persuaded. Language has played a central role in much of this research and it has been found that language is important both for comprehension of central messages and for building ethnic identity. Much of the current research has explored the impact of Spanish versus English but there is little research on the impact of Spanglish, a widely used option. An empirical study was conducted in Montebello, California where Hispanics of varying acculturation levels were presented with print advertisements in English, Spanish and Spanglish.

2006-1221,Spatial Structuring at Work: Physician Use of Computer Mediated Communication,Theme Interactive Paper Session,Theme Sessions,,,Paper,Spatial Structuring at Work: Physician Use of Computer Mediated Communication,Theme Interactive Paper Session,"This paper uses the disparate spatial practices of radiologists and outpatient physicians to frame a study of the relationship between communication technology use, the spatial organization of work, and workplace change, with a particular focus on the control each specialty was able to exert over the use of computer mediated communication (CMC) to change their work. Drawing from diverse urban, organization and economic literatures, I propose a spatial structuring approach to studying this relationship. From a structuring perspective, spatial practices are seen as both shaping and being shaped by information technology use. I apply this approach to a mixed methods, empirical research project situated in the two medical specialties mentioned above.

For radiologists, their historic spatial practices contributed to both their need and their ability to control the use of teleradiology applications. Radiologists have done their core work remote from their patients since the inception of their profession. This history shaped the active role U.S. radiologists have played in determining the use of teleradiology.

In contrast to radiologists, outpatient physicians have historically constructed their core work as being done face-to-face and synchronously with their patients. As a result, they showed less inclination and ability to control the use of information technologies which increased and changed those portions of their work that can be performed remotely."
2006-1222,"Speaking Pagan: Cultural Competency, Community, and Symbolic Activity",Performing Identities,Language & Social Interaction,,,Works in Progress,"Speaking Pagan: Cultural Competency, Community, and Symbolic Activity",Performing Identities,"In this paper, we argue that what it means to be Pagan is based on the organization of symbolic activity that is both temporal (based on culturally and historically-laden ritualized behaviors) and contextual (part of a lived everyday experience). By examining the symbolic activity of Spirit Walkways, a pagan community in Southern Illinois, we explore how pagan culture is constituted and re-constituted in everyday symbolic activity. We do this to try to understand cultural notions of competency; that is, that members participate in certain ways of speaking (which includes both verbal and nonverbal activity) that are interpreted as behavior indicative of identity and membership in the group. In this analysis based on early stages of data collection, we are able to make out several research themes that will serve as sites for a more focused research activity. These themes relate to how members: a) use labels for each other and themselves, b) speak of their (European) pagan roots, c) possess physical and contextual identifiers, and d) use insider information. We also discuss implicit and explicit modes for cultural competency acquisition."

How do insights about chronemics in face-to-face communication transfer to the online context? This project looks into turn-taking in asynchronous computer mediated communication by analyzing three diverse datasets comprising a total of more than 150,000 responses created by: (1) corporate employees in work contexts, (2) university students in course discussion groups, and (3) public participants in a commercial information seeking forum. The response times revealed in each of the datasets yield a power-law distribution. Moreover, most of the responses (at least 70%) were created within the average response time of the responders, and very few (at most 4%) of the responses were created after a period longer than ten times the average response time. These generalized findings persist across various users, contexts, and even across traditional as well as online communication media, and suggest some reformulations of the turn-taking rules proposed by Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson."

Our experimental research builds on these findings to examine how different modalities of presidential debate presentations (single screen or split screen) and post debate spin (no spin, policy focused, or performance focused) influence judgments of political trust and news credibility. No direct effects of these manipulations are observed, but building on work by Eveland and Shah (2003), we find that political talk conditions certain experimental effects on perceptions of news credibility, but not political trust. Specifically, news credibility is adversely affected by the use of split screen presentations, but only among those who engage in higher levels of political talk. Thus, it appears that the negative effects of in your face politics may be reserved for those more attuned to politics through the interpersonal exchange of views on policy and government and limited in scope to judgments about media credibility, not political trust."
2006-1225,"Sport, Property Rights, and the Emerging Information Monopoly in Australia",Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,"Sport, Property Rights, and the Emerging Information Monopoly in Australia",Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"This paper explores how property rights in sporting spectacles  both real and intellectual ─ could give rise to information monopolies that fall outside Australias competition laws. As event organisers and promoters see the commercial advantage of the Internet, they are producing their own news sites and competing for readership of the traditional news sources such as newspapers, television and radio. While the Internet is being heralded as the vehicle of greater information diversity, the commodification of sporting spectacles means that event organisers can derive an information monopoly in relation to their events. This is particularly problematic in Australia where major media networks control sporting codes such as the NRL. This study employs a variety of methods including a survey of on-line newspaper sports writers and editors. A poor response rate to the survey resulted in the author conducting in-depth interviews with some on-line sports editors to expand the information derived from survey responses. The author also obtained copies of contracts, outlining the entry conditions to sporting events for on-line reporters. Using information collected from the survey responses and interviews, the author develops a scenario and applies existing legal principles to predict how the law may help create an information monopoly. It then analyses whether the emerging monopoly could be actionable as anti-competitive conduct pursuant to section 46 Trade Practices Act (1974)."

The Convention addresses key issue sin communication and culture, focusing on the promotion of national and sub-national spheres for communication and cultural exchange, as well as the promotion of human rights and the international exchange of ideas. Have the policies and proposals to promote cultural diversity changed as the forum for discussion of the issue has moved from the International Network on Cultural Policy to UNESCO? Have the roles of civil society groups, international organizations changed over this time. In what ways has the Government of Canadas input and role changed with this shift? In what ways has the input of civil society groups, especially that of the Canadian-based International Network for Cultural Diversity, and the Coalition for Cultural Diversity, changed in the last three years? The paper compares a number of proposals, draft texts for the convention, and critiques of draft texts to illustrate approaches to a number of the key issues at stake in the formation of this convention."

We argue that media studies must play a more significant role in public life, but will continue to be stifled by a set of five orthodoxiesrelated to advocacy, media power, media ownership, technology, and laborthat currently inhibit the field from contributing very much to debates over the burning issues of the day or to the search for solutions to social problems. We offer examples of the ways that the orthodoxies that govern Media Studies keep it from confronting vital issues or influencing public policy processes. Our main contention is that media studies must install political economy into its fundamentals to modify the orthodoxies that have hampered it. We say this recognizing that this is no less an inhibiting orthodoxy than the ones we critique. What makes political economy essential to the project of revitalizing media studies is the way it helpfully destabilizes the five orthodoxies to force deeper reflection on questions of advocacy, media power, media ownership, technology, and labor. In the conclusion we indicate ways to press political economy into the field and its orthodoxies in order to rethink a socially engaged media studies."

Trait lists were compared across age groups and to Western traits reported in earlier research (Matheson, Collins & Kuehne, 2000; Chasteen, Schwarz, & Park, 2002). Results indicated that Chinese participants had multiple stereotypes and mixed perceptions of the young. While considerable overlap was observed between stereotype traits generated by these Chinese participants and those from earlier studies with Western participants (e.g., energetic, ambitious, lazy, and reckless), unique Chinese traits (e.g., open-minded, filial, hedonistic, and individualistic) associated with young adults were also identified. Whereas the middle-aged and older participants listed an equal number of positive and negative traits, the young participants generated significantly more negative traits than positive ones about their own age group. Discussion focuses on the impact of modernization and cultural change on perceptions of young adults in the Chinese society."

Of the 2196 programs in the sample 482 (22.1%) included some information related to mental illness. The amount of information related to mental illness was greatest on the Spanish language network Univision on which 48 of 142 (40.8%) programs contained some information about mental illness. Slang terms for mental illness were heard in 43.8% of the sample; a much smaller percentage used derogatory gestures. The use of derogatory and slang terms was found to be quite prevalent in programming for children. On MTV, for example, 65.5% of programs contained a mental illness slang term. Nickelodeon also featured relatively more characters with a mental illness than most other networks."

Despite the fact that 80% of all lung cancer deaths are linked to tobacco use, prior research has shown that the mass media rarely linked tobacco to lung cancer and often portrayed cancer as a death penalty rather than focusing on prevention or treatment. This study used content analysis to examine a census of news articles (N=73) from seven major U.S. newspapers published over a six month period. Results found that although the newspapers seem to do a better job linking risk factors with lung cancer and discussing survival rates of lung cancer, they still did not fulfill a strong media advocacy role. Therefore, these newspapers missed an opportunity to educate the public by not providing complete and accurate information regarding lung cancer."

Through random telephone surveys (N=200), the authors confirmed and strengthened some of the conclusions of the six previous studies; however, the authors also found some inconsistent results. In addition, the authors reviewed the value of a decade of strategic risk communication campaigns research projects. After ten years of risk communication campaigns and subsequent analysis of approximately 2400 professionally conducted telephone interviews (n=2399) throughout three different cities dominated by manufacturing facilities, community concern about chemical manufacturing risks and community safety remained high, with a higher sense of risk in communities with more sophisticated risk communication campaigns. Residents continue to be willing to familiarize themselves with emergency response measures that give them a greater sense of control, as well as increased trust for industry and city emergency response experts. Support for the chemical industry continues to increase, and this study demonstrates that protracted risk management/risk communication efforts facilitate the empowerment of citizens with the practical knowledge of what to do in the event of a manufacturing emergency."

2006-1253,Strategies of Slowness Between a Communicative Ideal and a Productive Body,"Communication, Interaction, Power",Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Strategies of Slowness Between a Communicative Ideal and a Productive Body,"Communication, Interaction, Power","This paper critically considers the political salience of 'slowness' as a democratic ideal for deliberation and contemplation as upheld by theorists concerned with communication, time, and the public. 'Slowing down' and 'taking time out' have become commonplace benefits within corporate institutions who offer employees yoga, massage, and spiritual healing such as reiki. Significantly, these 'slow down' practices are offered as a means to cultivate a 'more' productive and efficient labourer. However, these practices share a similar discurisve terrain as communications and cultural studies theory concern with speed culture and lament for nature, community, and open public spaces. I argue a new framework to understand temporal relations of power is fundamentall if time continues, as it is currently, to be problematized within communications theory. Instead of focusing on the commodification, control, and colonizaiton of time what is required is a conception of time and communication that is understood as linked to biopower and biopolitical production. This would allow for a concept of power relations under capital wherein it is not only life that has become the subject and object of production but also the 'meaning' of one's time."

Results found that stressful life events are significantly associated with the consumption of the Internet for mood management (such as entertainment and information seeking) and social compensation (such as recognition gaining and relationship maintenance) motives. Secondly, the more children and adolescents exhibit a high level of social support, through online or offline means, the less they will find stressful life events upsetting. Thirdly, as individuals exhibit greater success at self-actualizing their needs from different types of social support, their motivations for Internet use will be more characteristically allied to mood-management and social-compensation motives. This study reasserts that mental and physical impact of stressful life events is in fact buffered by ones degree of social support and Internet motives, which are, especially entertainment and relationship maintenance, positive coping strategy to temporarily reduce stress and anxiety."

The structure of ICA in 2005 based on the joint memberships was compared to the structure in 1991. The results suggest the dimensions that differentiate the divisions/interests groups, have remained constant. As reported by Barnett and Danowski (1992), ICA is organized along three dimensions: mass to interpersonal, humanities to social sciences and applied to theoretical. that there was a change in the divisions centrality between 1991 and 2005. Also, while Mass communication remained at the center of the network, the Technology and Political Communication divisions became more central. The semantic network analysis found that Philosophy and International/Intercultural Communication were the most central with Interpersonal and Information Systems at the periphery with the recently formed interest groups. Finally, there is a significant correlation between the semantic network and the network of joint memberships."

In both cultural contexts, predispositions to avoid verbal and nonverbal communication, lowered socio-communicative orientations, and lowered amounts of communication behaviors resulted in negative evaluations of instructors and less reported learning; however, communicative predispositions, orientations, and avoidance are more problematic for students from high-context cultures in relationships with instructors and learning in U.

Based on the literature from various perspectives, this study proposed four factors are critical in influencing such intentions to perform supportively for the university: 1) students communication behaviors with the university, 2) perceived quality of educational experiences, 3) evaluations of relational outcomes with the university, and 4) university reputation held by students. The data in this study were collected using a survey of current undergraduate students (N = 336) who were attending at a private university in Seoul during fall, 2005. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the proposed model. Regarding the overall results of the study, the proposed model can be retained as a valid model based on data-model fits; all eight hypotheses were supported in this study, except for the effect of students education experience on university reputation. The findings of this study suggest that, to foster students supportive behaviors, universities need to cultivate a good relationship with their students and to obtain favorable reputation held by students, while ensuring active communication behaviors of students and the quality of students educational experiences."

This study combines content analysis (n=45 ads) with population survey data from the Legacy Media Tracking Surveys (LMTS; n=32,977 teens) to (1) identify the effects of specific visual, audio, and format features on recall of televised anti-tobacco ads and (2) test whether effects are moderated by the need for sensation (NFS). Consistent with research derived from the Limited Capacity Model of Mediated Message Processing (LCM), five of seven hypothesized stylistic features increased the likelihood of ad recall. However, contrary to predictions outlined by the Activation Model of Information Exposure (AMIE), we observed no differences in the magnitude of these effects by NFS. Results underscore the importance of stylistic considerations in designing health campaign messages and, combined with other recent studies, raise questions about the AMIEs central propositions."

This thesis examined the three types of norms to determine if they are alternate indicators of the same underlying construct of if they are three separate constructs. A survey measuring these types of norms and their influence on behavior was conducted. The results suggest that the three types of norms are, in fact, three separate constructs. This is evidenced by the low correlation between the three types of norms and by the different relationships each norm type has with behavior. The findings of this study have large implications for future studies and campaigns employing norms."

The core finding of this paper is that media coverage of child sexual abuse has a very significant part to play in terms of effects on public opinion and attitudes. The degree of effect has yet to be determined but the immediate effect of a change in public opinion, in this case at least, has already been sufficient in this case to bring about a statutory investigation by the authorities."

Abstract
This age of global communication has revived a debate among scholars about whether culture still matters. This study brings this debate to the study of online news use. An international survey tests whether cultural boundaries can be used to predict differences in the choices individuals make when accessing online news. The findings suggest cultural boundaries are nearly, though not completely, absent in many of the news decisions individuals make, and that online news is being used in a highly individualized manner."

On the surface, Taiwan looks very much like many of the cosmopolitan areas in the world in which cultural hybridity is a byproduct of globalization. However, when closely looking at Taiwan society, one notices a seemingly paradoxical force pushing the island in the opposite direction. The drastic political and social changes in recent decades have created a desperate need for Taiwan to search for local identity and subjectivity. This paper examines the continuing search for answers to the question of what is Taiwan culture? along with the formation of Taiwan identity amid the variety of postcolonial discourses and globalization processes. I argue that the debate is very much shaped by political attitudes toward Taiwans future. Notions of globalization and hybridity have emerged from the debate, but are too often not critically examined. I call for media scholars to pay attention to cultural politics in Taiwan and I also suggest possibilities for research in this area."

Participants in a within-subjects experiment were exposed to 30-second televised advertisements previously coded as non-attack, slowed-paced; non-attack, fast-paced; attack, slow-paced; or attack, fast-paced political advertisements. Results indicated that non-attack, slow-paced advertisements were not only the most recallable, but also the most attention-grabbing. These results contradict previous findings that negative and/or fast-paced commercial messages and/or public service announcements are the most attention-grabbing and memorable"

Code 46 fits uneasily within the science-fiction genre as it is set in a near future of global integration and environmental catastrophe. The ferociously classist social order is governed by a panoptic corporation, The Sphinx, that also regulates gene-environment interactions. I argue that Winterbottoms film engages with a stringent cross-examination of The Narrative of Progress as it intersects with globalization. In particular, the narrative and mise-en-scene presents some of the enabling and --- with greater emphasis --- the dystopic possibilities that are implicit within liberalism that is channeled through capitalism with its concomitant class striation. Code 46 also engages with the Oedipal narrative that informs the critical gaze that film directs at the future/present and its implications for gender and the internalization of bureaucratic authority."

Data were collected using online participant observation, the course management systems automated tracking of students course website usage, and online questionnaires. Among the practices that fostered an engaged learning community and supported student satisfaction and achievement were: (1) assigning a multifaceted autobiographical essay assignment, (2) implementing an anonymous course feedback forum, (3) implementing a Help Me, Please! discussion forum, (4) using grading rubrics, and (5) leveraging older as well as emerging communication channels to enhance students learning experiences."

This study began with a model based on the belief that both educational-risk level and problem solving skills training would influence behavioral efficacy and attempted to investigate processes related to locus of control and self-efficacy that underlie this influence. A quasi experiment first varied the problem solving skills training (trained, not trained) at different levels of student educationally at-risk students (at-risk, non-risk) and then measured problem-solving cognitive skill, locus of control, self-efficacy, and behavioral outcome efficacy on a sample of 88 students. Separate models for at-risk and non-risk students evolved. Models for both groups represent a process in which problem solving skills training influences locus of control (positively for at-risk but not positively for non-risk students) which then increases self-efficacy and subsequent behavioral outcome efficacy."

This system, the commercial credit reporting agency, or mercantile agency, brought thousands of American citizensmerchants, traders, manufacturers, and artisansinto a massive network of social monitoring designed to facilitate safe business relationships in a world increasingly inhabited by strangers. The history of contemporary surveillance technologies, especially in the U.S., would be incomplete without drawing closer attention to its development. This is the case for several reasons. First, the mercantile agency is a direct descendant of the modern consumer credit bureau, an institution that functions with remarkable autonomy and influence in contemporary American society. Second, as purveyors of information commodities, nineteenth-century credit reporting agencies struggled with issues of information control and dissemination that, upon reflection, appear quite modern. These struggles also involved privacy debates that are relevant in light of more recent concerns over computerized consumer surveillance. And finally, this networked system of centralized information processing, which might be viewed as a type of proto-database, was instrumental in transforming embodied social relationships into textualized and increasingly abstract and impersonal data profiles."

By conducting and comparing a week long content analysis of the primary terrestrial channels within these seven countries over a period of four decades (1962  2001), this paper categorizes four distinct tiers of media importers within the Anglophone sphere using the concept of asymmetrical interdependence.
The first tier, Non-Importers, is comprised only of the United States, which imports little. The second tier, Low Importers, is comprised of the United Kingdom, which imports approximately 15  25%. The third tier, Medium Importers, is comprised of Australia and Anglo-Canada, which both import approximately 50%. The fourth tier, High Importers, is comprised of Jamaica, Ireland and New Zealand, all of which import approximately 60  80%. This paper illustrates the continuously shifting dynamics and theoretical implications of these seven countries as they supplement their own national television programming industries, in varying degrees, with materials produced by other members of their Anglophone cultural sphere or cultural market. Both tier and individual country dynamics are examined. Theoretically, special attention is paid to cultural-linguistic markets, cultural discount, cultural proximity, transnational media-scapes, and asymmetrical interdependence. National policies and market dynamics are also examined."

The analytical examples are taken from entertainment as well as factual television, and from public service as well as commercial contexts. In the article is argued that there has been an approximation between the textual features and generic and narrative structures of entertainment and factual live television, and a model is presented, that is suppose to account for these narrative patterns."
2006-1274,Television News in Dialogical Format: What It Means for Journalism in the Post-Network Era,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,Television News in Dialogical Format: What It Means for Journalism in the Post-Network Era,Journalism Studies Interactive Paper Session,"Cable news stands out not only for the different content it provides, compared to the Network news, but also for its distinct narrative format. Unlike the edited news package, which dominates the Network news, cable tells the news story through conversation, a format dubbed here dialogical news. This paper argues that this shift in format bears meaningful effects on the function of journalists and news organizations and the place of journalism in society, namely: (1) the authority of the news reporter diminishes; (2) question-asking replaces fact-checking as a central function of journalism (3) news organizations relinquish their accountability for news content; (4) the news audience assumes the role of witness or participant rather than receiver. As cable news and their dialogical format become more prominent in Americans news repertoire, these propositions indicate short and long term consequences. In the short-run, journalists are losing their battle to control their sources and maintain their gatekeeping function. In the long run, journalism might lose its significance as societys reflexive storyteller, reverting instead to its former role as a partisan instrument, a source of entertainment or a bit of both."

Snob and Slob Taste for Television Programs in the Netherlands in 2000,Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Bourdieu (1979/1984) argued that people demarcate societal boundaries through a lifestyle that exhibits their cultural taste. Peterson and Simkus (1992) amended Bourdieu's theory using the concepts of cultural omnivores and univores. Research on omnivorousness and univorousness has typically focused on musical tastes. Our research extends this field to tastes for television programs using data from a survey among a stratified probability sample of the adult Dutch population (n=825). Through correspondence analysis, we showed that people from higher status groups and with larger amounts of cultural capital watch less program types than implied by Peterson and Simkus' (1992) amendment. Preferences with respect to television program types are compliant with Bourdieu's (1979/1984) original theory on the distinctive force of taste expressions."

The paper examines how fraud and mismanagement crises are managed via the news release tactic. Specifically, this study sought evidence if, and how the content of the news release is featured in news coverage of the crisis. Fifteen cases of fraud-related crises are examined. The findings suggest that new releases quotes, background information, and image repair tactics are incorporated into the news stories about the crisis."

A path analysis compared real world events (deaths and attacks attributed to terrorism), presidential emphasis, media coverage and foreign aid for 20 African nations. Results show a clear trend of agenda setting at the second level  when nations were emphasized with a terrorism frame. Overall, the findings suggest deaths attributed to terrorism influenced the news and policy agendas. Presidential emphasis of nations involvement in terrorism influenced media coverage and the policy agenda. Media coverage of nations with a terrorism frame influenced the policy agenda. Only one significant path coefficient was found in the analysis of first-level agenda setting, which examined the 20 African nations with and without terrorism framing: The more President Bush mentioned a nation in his public statements, the more the New York Times covered the country."

In this paper we will present findings of research conducted with the revised version of the Communication and Organizational Change questionnaire, in which we will discuss the construction, and revisions of the questionnaire, as well as results from two case studies and the preferred application of the method described. Results show that especially information and communication about the necessity of the change, and about the goals and direction of the change have an impact on support for the change, and the role of line managers in information providing on the change has an impact on contribution to the change."

This study aims to identify the main factors influencing the use of online feedback channels by integrating the theory of planned behavior (TPB) with the technology acceptance model (TAM), and adding a new variable to the model, attitude toward target. Telephone interviews were used to gather responses from a random sample of Singaporean adults (n = 1,004). A regression analysis indicates that all predictors, except attitude toward target and the perceived behavioral control variable of behavioral constraints, were significant in explaining the intention to provide online feedback. Subjective norm, incorporating conformity to norm, was the strongest predictor of online feedback. The findings support the predictive validity of established measures from TAM, TPB and political efficacy in this studys hybrid model, and may prove useful when applied in future studies of political communication and participation."

Drawing from Nabi and Krcmars (2004) tripartite model of media enjoyment, this study examines how affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to a participatory reality TV program predict program enjoyment and future program viewing. Responses to surveys over three weeks of Foxs American Idol series suggested that cognitive and affective responses to a program were highly interrelated. Further, past program viewing positively associated with behavioral engagement, enjoyment, and viewing intention, though behavioral engagement showed minimal effects in the latter contexts. Also, cognitive and affective reactions predicted enjoyment, viewing intention, and subsequent program viewing. Implications for participatory reality TV and the study of enjoyment are discussed."

Using opposing groups of partisans in the debate over genetically modified organisms, we tested the influence of source (journalist versus college student) and reach (mass media versus classroom composition) on perceptions of bias. The data revealed effects for both factors. Earlier research supported several processing mechanism underlying the hostile media effect, but using stringent tests, we found evidence only for a categorization bias."

The present study tests some propositions and ideas of the interpersonal deception theory, namely, whether engaging in strategic behavior and displaying more nonstrategic cues are more characteristic of deceivers than truth tellers; if skilled senders perform more strategic activities; and the dynamic character of deception in interactive contexts. The results reveal that there is no significant difference between deceivers and truth tellers in behavior management, strategy use and nonstrategic behavior. There is not enough evidence that deceivers, as well as truth tellers, apply strategies or modify their behavior necessarily based on partners reactions. Finally, the results do not support the idea that more skilled senders are better at appearing truthful by performing more strategic behavior, although the findings indicate that they exercise more behavior control."

Employees were enrolled in a pair-matched group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled design with two follow-up surveys. Half of the ski areas were randomly assigned to implement Go Sun Smart in the winter. This paper reports analyses of responses from 1,463 employees who completed the second follow-up survey at the end of the following summer (69% of those who completed the first posttest). Go Sun Smart continued to have positive effects on employees who worked at intervention ski areas into the summer. Employees exposed to Go Sun Smart reported less sunburning, engaged in more sun safety behaviors, were more aware of the program, and had more discussions of sun safety at home than employees at matched control group resorts. The long-term effects of Go Sun Smart support recommending that sun protection programs be implemented at workplaces, but such programs should be implemented with high fidelity to achieve maximum benefits. Despite limitations due to non-response, geography, measurement, and ethnicity, the hierarchical clustered design improved the internal validity and generalizability of the findings."

A 135-item survey was administered to 132 college students at the University of Michigan that measured general attitudes toward reality television and its characters, as well as scores of parasocial interactions with both non-reality and reality TV characters. This study uses Crocker et al.s (2003) Contingencies of Self Worth Scale to investigate domain-specific areas of self-esteem, such as Approval from Others and Competitiveness, as psychological predictors of parasocial interaction with reality TV characters. The findings reveal that both negative and positive attitudes toward reality television programs and characters are significantly related to specific contingencies of self-esteem and parasocial identification."

The main findings: 1. Leaks were highly prevalent: each fifth item involved the sensitive practice; 2. The dominant leakers were senior sources; 3. The favorite channel for leaks was the telephone; 4. Leaked stories were initiated equally by reporters and sources; 5. Leaks were cross verified with additional sources much more frequently than non-leaked items. The study, which took place in Israel 2001, focused on national daily press reporters and their contacts with news sources."

We used the respondents own prototype programs as alternative abstract levels in place of general television. Results show that the scales used to tap television viewing experiences at the specific abstract level (i.e., measured using viewers own prototype programs) were more valid and reliable than the scales used at the general level. Based on the findings, we suggested that two guiding principles in regard to levels of abstraction (i.e., the abstract level specificity and the abstract level matching principle) for future research. The principles should be used assess the levels of abstraction for independent and dependent variables that a researcher is trying to investigate for a research study. This will help the researcher avoid the abstract level discrepancy effect which may have produced non-existent relationships among the research variables."

The theoretical model offers new ways to incorporate culturally sensitive third party intervention (Bush and Folger, 1994) by improving decision making. The theory intersects three areas of communication research; mediation, small group decision making, and face theory. Mediation is a small group communication context where the mediators role is to harness key activity interventions. Activity interventions are breakpoints in the conversation where the mediator senses a shift in activity and can intervene with appropriate face saving strategies (Ting-Toomey, 2005). Small group decision making is complex in itself (Poole, M. S., 1989), without the added stresses of conflict. Therefore the theory proposes that decision making can be improved during mediation by attending to face concerns. The Activity Intervention model extends mediation literature by explaining when intervention is appropriate (at certain breakpoints) and how to intervene (through specific face saving strategies)."

This study is a critical investigation of the reality show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, as a site of queer discourse that both challenges and reassures dominant perceptions of homosexuality. Despite the assertion of homonormative themes in this more sophisticated version of gay lifestyles, this study finds that the program, on balance, reinforces heteronormative themes and dominant heterosexual power roles. The apolitical power granted to the Fab 5 is of an aesthetic nature, permitting them to induce primarily cosmetic change justified by consumer rhetoric."

Surprisingly, there is no published research available about playing these games. We conducted an exploratory Internet survey (N=752) in order to gather information about who the players of online first person shooters are, and why they spend time on playing this particular kind of video game. The results of our survey on the one hand confirmed the stereotype of the gamer as it is often presented in popular media: the players of online FPS were indeed almost exclusively young men (mean age about 18 years) who spend a lot of their leisure time on gaming (about 2.6 hours per day). We also found that the most committed gamers, that is, the ones who were members of a (semi)professional clan, scored highest on motives with respect to competition, and challenge in comparison with members of amateur clans and online gamers who had not joined a clan.
On the other hand, our results cast doubt on the accuracy of the stereotype. This study showed clearly that online FPS gamers are not playing in isolation. More than eighty percent of our respondents were member of a clan. Also, the regression analysis showed that the social interaction motive was the strongest predictor of the time actually spend on gaming."

The following paper aims at making a contribution towards answering this question. Firstly, we will define a theoretical framework for the analysis of the require-ments of organizational communication in the context of socio-political and technical change. In connection with that, Castells concept of the network society plays a key role. From a theoretical point of view, due to the introduction of new information and communications technologies, organizational structures have changed as well as internal and external publics with which an organization is confronted. Secondly, a concrete case study will be conducted: The success in organizational communication of Attac Germany  an organization from the field of the so-called counterculture  is analyzed in terms of its very specific network attrib-utes. Our findings show that in spite of the lack of classic resources, organizations from the field of counterculture are also capable of achieving successful long-term communication in the political public sphere if they take advantage of the socio-political and technical change by implementing their own communication strategy, thereby relying on the advantages of a network organization."

The results of this research show that bestsellers in art and culture can be studied as multistage processes in which different sorts of gatekeepers participate sequentially and in which success in one stage is vital for success in subsequent stages. In my paper I describe the network of mediators that contributed to the best-selling status of The Secret History in the United States. Part of the research into the bestseller system will examine the role, function and status of critics and criticism in art worlds where commercial and popular aspects have become more and more dominant. Special attention will therefore be paid to the role of the serious press in the valuation of the work of Donna Tartt. The paper ends by describing the reception of The Secret History in the Netherlands, where the book found its largest reading public. Thus, the paper not only highlights the different stages of a bestseller in art and culture, but also shows its strong international character."

In the multi-dimensionally inter-connected blogosphere, users have become able to receive, process, and circulate news and information in a novel way. With its all fresh tools of communication, the blogosphere constructs space for a public forum. As the blogosphere provides a new environment of communication and connotes distinct implications, many are thrilled at the possibility of a new public space. They consider the possibility of reinvigorating citizens by involving the new generation in politics through the public blogosphere. When contemplating the relation between the blogosphere and the public sphere, we can briefly raise following questions: Does the blogosphere function as the public sphere? If so, how close can the blogosphere come to the ideal of the public sphere? This study attempts to answer these questions by examining potentials and limits of the blogosphere as a public sphere."

The sly deceit concealed within journalists use of sources as apparently independent and authoritative commentators, enables the journalist to masquerade as mere conveyance of others perspectives while actually peddling a particular viewpoint by the choice of speaker and the choice of quote. This study interrogates the content of three English regional newspapers over a constructed two-week period, upto, during and after the British General Election 2005, in order to identify gender differences in the use of sources. It argues that as with the national press, men are more than twice as likely as women to be used as sources and that women journalists are no more likely to source women than male colleagues. It concludes that a newsroom culture which privileges elite and other (white) male voices appears to exert a greater influence and conformity over who counts as an authoritative voice than any individual newsworkers proclivities to more accurately reflect their views of their diverse local community."

While often ascribed to institutions, collective memory can be found in smaller foci such as individual families. This paper seeks to explore collective memory by focusing on courtship stories within the family. Stories of how couples met and began their relationships become a means through which to examine the role of memory in courtship and familial norms. This paper argues that stories of courtships function as a form of collective memory which can reify familial bonds. Drawing on oral histories which were conducted with multigenerational families, this paper explores the ways in which courtship stories are actively and collectively produced and re-produced within the family setting. The thematic motifs of courtship stories are also identified and discussed."

The purpose of the study was to support the claim that wrinkles can actually enhance perceptions of likeability. Building on the universal emotion expressions discovered by Ekman (1978), this thesis transposed wrinkles that are characteristic of prosocial and antisocial expressions onto neutral faces. Creating six photographs with differing wrinkle patterns (three of the photographs representing different degrees of antisocial wrinkles and three photographs representing different degrees of prosocial wrinkles), 110 subjects rated these photographs on the dependent measure of liability. A univariate ANOVA was used to examine if wrinkles had any effect on perceptions of likeability. Although no statistically significant differences were found between likeability and the varying degrees of prosocial and antisocial wrinkling, post hoc analyses revealed a significant gender effect in the decoding of facial expressions. Specifically, females were more likely than males to notice an increase in wrinkling."

The author argues that space is not given; nor is it a background against which things happen. Instead, space is lived entity that is socially constructed by people living in that visual environment. It is an active component throughout the entire social construction process that bestows meaning to space. By utilizing the traditional Chinese housing  Hutong  as a departure point, the author is able to demonstrate the cultural dimension of space and the spatial dimension of culture; at the same time, illustrate the intricate relationship between the two. In addition, this probing into the socio-spatial relations is placed within the paradigm of globalization. In a sense, this relationship symbolizes a course of actionthe nonlinear momentum of globalization  the before, during, and after. Thus, this paper is geared towards understanding that fluxing nature of space within the paradigm of social change impacted by globalization. The question posed here concerns how spatial change exemplify and embody social change as well as the other way around."

The theoretical framework of the paper has three components: the social construction of reality theory, gender as an analytical concept and the Foucauldian thesis of governmentality. The study treats advertising as a form of power as well as a governing technique in the discursive formation of various social relations. It explores how advertising (as a commercial power) defines, describes, delimits and circumscribes the way of talking about people and how it plays a central part in the construction of consumer population. Within a Foucauldian paradigm, this paper examines how different social elements (individual, family and other social concepts) were used to differentiate as well as unify consumer population in early twentieth century China, an early stage in the development of modernity in China. With a particular interest in gender, the politics that governed the contests over gender are explored. The selected advertisements in Shenbao from 1921-1929 were studied. Featuring the consumption of commodities, these advertisements played a central part in the formation of Chinese people as consumers. With the overarching discourse of Chinese people as a consumer population, four sub-discourses of consumer population were identified: 1) female and male as ungendered categories of the consumer population; 2) woman and man as citizens of China; 3) a happy family as a consuming unit; 4) female consumer as a specific consumer population."

This article explores the dynamics of political discussion on the Internet, in the context of a broad theoretical debate about the direction of political trends in an age of new media. Some have argued that the Internet reinvigorates democracy by providing an environment that encourages the discussion of politics within heterogeneous networks. Others have argued that the Internet is more likely to encourage selective exposure to politically homogeneous networks and may therefore exacerbate existing political cleavages by contributing to an overall trend in political fragmentation. Theoretically, political discussion is a useful focus for exploring trends in political communication. This article theorizes that social context variables regulate the nature of political discussion online, and hypothesizes that trends toward homogeneity of communication are dominant. Based on data from an RDD survey focusing on peoples media use and political behavior, this paper employs hierarchical regression analysis to model the relationship between Internet use and the heterogeneity of political discussion networks. The results show that the discussion of politics online does not contribute to the heterogeneity of individual political discussion networks, supporting the view that the Internet does not mitigate the fragmentation of public discourse."
2006-1314,"The Coverage of War, Security, and Defense Policy: Do Women Matter?",Where Women Live: World Circumstances Complicating Lives,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,"The Coverage of War, Security, and Defense Policy: Do Women Matter?",Where Women Live: World Circumstances Complicating Lives,"Our social consciousness reserves the role of the fighter solely for men. And because of our accepted model of womanhood, women are not considered as being authoritative, competent, or decisive actors in the context of war and violence. Violence and war are topics that make it especially difficult to perceive women as acting subjects. The media provide an important social space for the construction of social consciousness and, additionally, construct gender characteristics and gender concepts themselves. It is said that especially during armed conflicts or other violent crises, female acting subjects leave the public (= media) stage  a place on which they are underrepresented even under normal circumstances. Media coverage of war, it is said, assigns the role of the victim to women. However, we do not actually have much empirical evidence to support this view due to the significant lack of quantitative studies on media coverage of women during wartime. As a result, in Germany we conducted a complex framing analysis of media coverage of war between 1980 and 2000. This paper deals with the results of this framing analysis and the representation of women during wartime in quality German newspapers. It is the first longitudinal gender-specific framing analysis of war coverage ever  not only in Germany."

It is based on interviews with 20 arts journalists in the United Kingdom, including classical music DJs, arts reviewers, arts reporters, and arts and music editors for print and broadcast media. This occupational group within journalism is worthy of study because of their distinctive professional and cultural role: While arts journalists share aspects of their professional cultures with other newsworkers, their work is intrinsically linked to the project of improving public appreciation of the arts.
Our argument is that while many arts journalists see themselves as part of the larger professional category of journalists, they also lay claim to an arts exceptionalism, insofar as they suggest (1) that the ideal arts journalist is better and more extensively qualified than a conventional news reporter, that (2) arts journalism is qualitatively different from news journalism, and (3) that arts journalism has the responsibility of communicating the transformative nature of the arts. Drawing on such a discourse, arts journalists take on a crusading role, and do their work infused by a passion which is otherwise frowned upon within journalism. We also demonstrate how, within the specialist group of arts journalists, there are distinctive subcultures of freelance critics, arts reporters and arts editors  professional categories which greatly influence these newsworkers self-understandings."

With the backdrop of the Iraq war and the war on terror, the 2004 election received even more attention than usual in the international community. President Bushs re-election elicited a myriad of emotions in the world. International newspaper editorials had quite a task during the immediate days after the election. Some re-capped the election, searched for reconciliation, gave advice, made predictions, and posed questions about the worlds future with another four years of Bush. This study investigated 51 international newspaper editorials for cynicism and diagnostic and prognostic framing while considering whether editorials appeared in coalition of the willing or non-coalition countries. The findings suggest coalition member editorials, in some regards, were significantly less cynical than non-coalition countries editorials. However, diagnostic and prognostic framing did not differ between coalition and non-coalition editorials."
2006-1317,The Death and Life of Deference: The British Media and the Monarchy,Narrative Structures of the News,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,The Death and Life of Deference: The British Media and the Monarchy,Narrative Structures of the News,"This paper explores the two main competing liberal and radical approaches to study of the British monarchy and the media. Liberal narratives suggest the existence of an oppositional relationship between the royals and (media) reptiles that reflects a pluralistic and democratic media reporting environment. But radical approaches, by contrast, claim the existence of a situation of undeferential deference, in which criticism of individual royals exists alongside very little debate about the institution of the monarchy. Even critical coverage tends to depoliticise, personalise and naturalise its existence in favour of a narrow narrative about the royal family. This means that far from the last fifty years witnessing the death of deference in media attitudes to the monarchy, this style of coverage remains the dominant form of media representation of the institution."
2006-1318,"The Demographics of Medical Roles on Television, The Flemish Case",Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,Mass Communication,,,Paper,"The Demographics of Medical Roles on Television, The Flemish Case",Mass Communication Interactive Paper Session,"The content analysis conducted in this study indicates that televisions portrayal of medical roles differs from the real-life populations. Television doctors generally differ from real-life doctors for both age and sex. Doctors on television are younger, and more likely to be male than in real-life. Prime-time and fiction programs give a less correct image when looking at age, while the depiction of the gender of doctors is further off the mark in non prime-time programming. The televised representation of the demography of nurses is not as incorrect as other research would suggest. Only the depiction of the age of the television nurses does not correspond with the real-life population. The results indicate that studies investigating television content should not only be limited to prime-time programming or fiction programming because health related and other television content can possibly differ over the different types of programming and the moment of broadcasting."

Especially, this study paid more attention to the significant potential of the Internet to enhance and facilitate public discourse and participation. This study found that interpersonal discussion through both face-to-face and online settings about politics plays an important role in the political effects of the news media, which was more significant predictors than Internet news use for political participation. Based on the findings, the implications of online political discussion were discussed."
2006-1320,The Diffusion of the Internet and Rural Development,Global and Local Communication in China,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,The Diffusion of the Internet and Rural Development,Global and Local Communication in China,"This study explores the applicability of the diffusion of innovations theory to the Internet development in rural China by examining the Internet diffusion and usage patterns in two rural areas of Chinas Gansu Province. Its ethnographic research design allowed the researchers to interact with the rural people under study and obtain first-hand data on their adoption and usage of the Internet.

The results show that in the context of rural China, where the local economy and infrastructure can hardly sustain such an advanced technology as the Internet, the diffusion and usage of the Internet are determined not much by the will of the individuals, but by the change agency. As the weakest social class in terms of their share and control of social resources, Chinese farmers as individuals do not play an important role in the adoption of the Internet, which tends to be the result of organizational initiatives."

This document provides a synthesis of the DITF findings and argues that the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) provides a theoretical framework for explaining DITF findings. To explore that possibility, participants (N=492) were asked to respond to a questionnaire assessing TPB constructs regarding a variety of social organizations. Two weeks later, participants received a phone call from one of the organizations (a local homeless shelter) soliciting donations. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three DITF conditions of varying request sizes or a target request-only condition. Results indicated significant differences in verbal and actual compliance based on request size. Moreover, the results indicated the importance of perceived behavioral control in DITF contexts. Limitations and directions for future DITF study are discussed."
2006-1322,The Dynamics of Intragroup Differentiation in an Intergroup Social Context,Performing Identities,Language & Social Interaction,,,Paper,The Dynamics of Intragroup Differentiation in an Intergroup Social Context,Performing Identities,"When groups of strangers interact they quickly develop a status hierarchy. Relatively little work tests explanations for this process, and the majority has been conducted in intragroup settings. We test an expectation states explanation in an intergroup context. Participants (N = 48) discussed capital punishment in six-person same-sex groups containing three pro- and three anti-capital punishment adherents. Those who emerged with high status directed more turns and proactive language at the outgroup than ingroup. Further, high but not low status group members were more successful at gaining turns when using proactive language, but less successful when using reactive language. Socioemotional standing in the group was a negative quadratic function of participation. Those higher on socioemotional standing were also less likely to direct reactive language at the outgroup. Our findings retained statistical significance when tested using multilevel models. Findings are consistent with expectation states theory, and suggest that intragroup differentiation is subtly but powerfully affected by status expectations, and the intergroup context."

Forty consultations, ten in each of the four gender combinations (male resident/male patient, male resident/female patient, female resident/female patient, female resident/male patient) were audio-taped and micro-analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Several findings depart significantly from previous studies with physician-only or physician-resident-mixed samples. First, the average length of the 40 consultations was 19.5 minutes, 11.3 minutes longer than consultations in a physician-only sample drawn in the same clinic previously. Second, male residents engaged in twice as much psychosocial talk as female residents and conducted longer consultations. Third, residents asked 80% of the total questions while patients asked 20% of the questions. Previous studies with physician-only or physician-resident-mixed samples reported that physicians ask 89% to 99% of the total questions. Finally, patients overall satisfaction and communication satisfaction were negatively correlated with residents positive talk which constitutes 31% of a given residents total utterances. In the study conducted in the same clinic with a physician-only sample, physician positive talk was 26% and physician positive talk was not correlated with patient satisfaction. Is this a signal that residents should reduce the amount of positive talk? Apparently more studies with resident- only-samples are needed to answer this and other unanswered questions in the field to offer directives to resident training."

In contrast, a recent study found that pregiving in this manner failed to increase compliance rates. This study offers and tests three different explanations for the missing pregiving effect. Furthermore, this study examines the presence of a potential confound in altruistic requests. Specifically, the success of altruistic requests might not result from the induction of empathy in the target, but rather because of the presence of a reason for the request. Research demonstrates that including a reason along with a request for compliance increases the likelihood of compliance. This experiment examined these issues employing a 2 X 3 independent groups, factorial design crossing three compliance-gaining message types with two pregiving conditions in which an influence agent asked targets to assist in an act of academic dishonesty. The data suggest a reverse pregiving effect under certain conditions. Specifically, the use of pregiving before soliciting compliance with a direct request or a direct request containing a reason lowered the rate of compliance below the rate observed in the absence of a pregiving favor. Furthermore, requests made in an altruistic fashion removed the reverse pregiving effect."

The purpose of the current study was to examine the situational factors that influence individuals apologetic intentions. A previous study on apology examined how offender responsibility, offense severity, and prior relationship between offender and victim influence individuals decisions to apologize when they offend others. The present study tried to overcome the limitations and explain some of the contradictory findings in that study. The major findings of the current study are as follows: (a) responsibility had a direct path and mediated path through other face concern to apologetic intention; (b) severity had neither direct nor mediated path to apologetic intention; (c) relationship had only mediated path through other face concern to apologetic intention; (d) self-positive face concern was only associated positively with severity; (e) self-negative face concern was associated negatively with responsibility and positively with severity; (f) other face concern was associated positively with responsibility and relationship; (g) other face concern was associated positively with apologetic intention; (h) apologetic intention would lead to actual apologetic behavior; (i) responsibility was significantly correlated with severity and relationship; (j) culture was found to be an important moderator in the apologetic process. Four paths in the proposed model were significantly different among the U.S. and Chinese samples."

To examine the effect, the study was 2 x 2 design with media framing (human-interest frame vs. non-human-interest frame) and crisis types (an accident vs. a transgression) as independent between-subject variables. The dependent variables were participants (N = 104) emotional response to a crisis, level of blame to the corporation, and level of the corporations responsibility to the crisis. The results showed that human-interest frame influenced participants emotional response to the crisis, and the emotional response was good predictor for blame and responsibility in a transgression but not in an accident."

A hypothetical lumber companys campaign was simulated to deliver either a one-sided or a refutational/nonrefutational two-sided message about the issue of clearcutting, the most controversial issue that the timber industry faces. Contrary to our expectations, a one-sided message had a persuasive advantage over two-sided messages, and induced more positive perceptions of CSR and attitudes toward the company. It was also found that the effect of message sidedness on participants attitudes toward the company was mediated by CSR."

According to theories of newsworthiness, three dimensions of deviance  statistical, social change, and normative  are considered as news values that attract journalists and audience because of biological human instincts. However, there was no empirical evidence that supports this argument. This experiment, in this sense, measured peoples attention and arousal to news photos with different levels of deviance, using physiological measures. 2 (Stat dev) X 2 (SC dev) X 2 (Norm dev) X 8 (presentation order) mixed-factor ANOVA analyses found more attention for high social change deviance and more arousal for high normative deviance. Statistical deviance only showed significant interactions with social change deviance or normative deviance. Timeliness of the photo events was suggested to explain different results for three dimensions of deviance."

We argue that these conditions will affect communicators efficacy of deliberation as well as the quantity and quality of deliberation. A field experiment was conducted to test of the impacts of the structural and regulative conditions upon political discussion efficacy. We found that the efficacy increased under the conditions of display of social identity cues and reinforcement of discussion efficacy. The quantity and quality of deliberation also had independent effects on the efficacy. The implications of the findings were discussed in terms of possible contributions of heightened political discussion efficacy for democracy."

Trust also has been thought of as the most effective means of reducing uncertainty and risk. Based on the fact that trust is a mechanism to reduce complexity, and a trait inherent to online transactions, this study has explored factors that influence trust during online transactions. Self-efficacy, which is an important factor in explaining motives and motivations of individual behaviors and choices, has an impact on trust building and uncertainty reduction. By incorporating self-efficacy into electronic commerce research, this study expands the understanding of what factors play a role in reducing uncertainty. Self-efficacy has been handled in two parts; general self-efficacy and online transaction self-efficacy. The result shows that both categories of self-efficacy affect trust in the web vendor and, consequently, positively influencing the respondents purchase intentions."

It was expected that individuals perceptions of control vary depending on their orientations of either independence or interdependence in self-construal. Four hypotheses were formulated regarding the relationship between self-construal, perceived control in interaction, and the two communication predispositions. Participants were 446 students in Hawaii. As expected, the results showed that independence in self-construal was significantly and positively related to internal control in interaction, while interdependence was positively related to external (chance or powerful others) control. Furthermore, internal control was positively related to argumentativeness, and external control was positively related with communication apprehension (CA) but negatively related with argumentativeness. Contrary to the prediction, internal control was positively related with CA. Limitations and directions for future studies were discussed."

We also report relationships between sensation seeking other smoking, drinking, sex, and disordered eating. Overall, we found that each of six tests that examined interactions between sensation seeking and peer and parent norms were in the same order. Specifically, higher eating disorder intentions were reported among those with high sensation seeking scores and strong norms, followed by those with low sensation seeking scores and strong norms, followed by those with high sensation seeking scores and low norms. Those with low sensation seeking scores and low norms were consistently lowest on eating disorder intentions. Moreover, we found that sensation seeking was significantly related to frequency of drinking and getting drunk, smoking, and sex but was only related to some high-risk eating behaviors, notably dieting and excessive exercise. These findings suggest that sensation seeking may contribute to disordered eating among college students, especially for individuals who have peer and parent norms that emphasize thinness and the acceptability of risky weight loss behaviors. Implications of targeting high sensation seekers who hold positive norms for disordered eating are discussed."

And what are the effects of individuals general cultural orientation (the trait individualism-collectivism), their situation-specific cultural orientation (the state individualism-collectivism), the message manipulation, and their interactions on the matching hypothesis? Furthermore, if the function could be activated, it was posited that messages that matched the culture-oriented values (individualism vs. collectivism) would be perceived as more persuasive, elicit more positive attitudes, and encourage higher intention to adopt the recommended actions. The results did not provide a certain answer to the research questions. Additionally, no main effects of the trait and state individualism-collectivism were found. However, the message manipulation (individualism vs. collectivism) significantly influenced how people perceived the messages. Furthermore, an interaction effect between the state individualism-collectivism, the trait individualism-collectivism, and the message manipulation on attitudes was statistically significant."

Through empirical research, this study found that congruent linkage between sponsor and a sponsored marketing program, Public Service Advertisements (PSA), is more persuasive than an incongruent linkage. Participants who watched a PSA congruent with the sponsoring company favored the company more and had greater purchase intention. In addition, this study investigated the moderating role of a sponsors familiarity. Findings revealed that there was no significant difference in consumer attitude between a familiar sponsor and an unfamiliar one. Participants showed favorable attitudes toward both companies who are doing good things. However, an unfamiliar companys sponsorship does not affect consumers purchase intentions. This study fails to support previous research that a favorable attitude would likely to result in increased purchase intention. The implications for future research are discussed."

Health professionals consulted on a breast cancer storyline in a Spanish-language telenovela, Ladrón de Corazones, and the impact on viewers knowledge and behavioral intentions were assessed using three methods. First, an analysis of call attempts to 1-800-4-CANCER demonstrated a significant increase in calls when a PSA aired during the program, and featured the telephone number. Second, a nationwide telephone survey indicated that viewers gained specific knowledge from viewing the story and that subsequently male viewers were significantly more likely to recommend that women have a mammogram. Women, however, did not show an increased intent to have mammograms. These trends were confirmed and further explored in the third methodology, focus groups of Ladrón viewers. Implications for educating viewers using dramatic serials in the United States are discussed."

The goal is to illuminate the independent and combined contributions of high information density in the audio and video tracks of a television message on emotional experience, arousal, cognitive effort, and recognition for the content of television messages. Results show that if you want your message to be attended to and remembered you should present most of the information in the audio track and present very little information in the video track. However, you can continue to use many structural features in the video track. In other words, those messages which seemed to perform the best in terms of both emotional and cognitive processing were those where the message was structurally complex, that is it contained many orienting eliciting structural features, but there was very little information introduced in the video track, and a great deal of information in the audio track."

Using this as a guide, the current paper presents two studies designed to build upon a study by Tidwell and Walther (2002) and examine the role of avatars in the uncertainty reduction process. The first study had stranger dyads interact over one of three conditions: face-to-face, text-only CMC or CMC with avatars, respond to measures of uncertainty and liking prior to initial interaction. The second study replicated this but measured uncertainty and liking after five minutes of interaction. A model was tested and found consistent with predictions of SIPT. Comparison of mean levels of uncertainty and liking across studies also present data consistent with SIPT. Finally, limitations and future areas of research are discussed."

An experiment was conducted where subjects were given four versions of ads - ads featuring Tiger Woods for sports drink, ads featuring K. J. Choi for sports drink, ads featuring Tiger Woods for ball-point pen, and ads featuring K. J. Choi for ball-point pen. The results of the study suggest that an ad with high relevance between celebrity and product can induce more positive Aad than an ad with low relevance. Results also show that Korean subjects were more likely to have more positive Aad, Ab and Pi for the advertisement featuring an American celebrity endorser."

This study examined if partner symmetry or partner complementarity on communication variables led to greater relational satisfaction, communication satisfaction, and closeness. Specifically, conflict style, communication apprehension, verbal aggressiveness, argumentativeness, criticalness, complaining, agreeableness, and extroversion were examined. A survey examining partner similarity and difference was conducted. The results indicated that couples were no more similar to each other than random others. Complementarity on verbal aggressiveness was found to correlate positively with communication satisfaction and complementarity on control conflict style was positively correlated with relationship satisfaction. Overall, the results suggest that there is little evidence for either symmetry or complementarity leading to greater levels of satisfaction or closeness which is somewhat contrary to previous research findings. The study did find that communication satisfaction, relational satisfaction, and closeness are highly associated. This study suggests future research in the area of complementarity and symmetry."

Participants read vignettes that varied in relationship types (in-group versus out-group members) and situation types (negative face versus positive face threatened) and responded to scales measuring realism of the vignettes, intention to apologize, and five types of face concerns. One of the findings showed that Chinese participants, compared to U.S. participants, had stronger intention to apologize when their act threatened the other persons positive face, while U.S. participants, compared to Chinese participants, had stronger intention to apologize when their act threatened the other persons negative face. Other findings and implications of the findings are discussed in more detail in the paper."

A mixed repeated measures within-and-between-subjects experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of type of computer games and gender on preschool childrens learning of mathematical addition. The results showed that both boys and girls demonstrated improved mathematical learning after playing either competitive and noncompetitive computer games. Preschool girls learned mathematical addition as effectively as did preschool boys. Thus, this study suggested that both competitive and noncompetitive mathematics computer games might have the potential to be used effectively in teaching preschool girls mathematics."
2006-1359,The Effects of Emotion and Issue Involvement on Entertainment-Education Viewers Intention to Register as Cornea Donors,Message Strategies: Involvement,Health Communication,,,Paper,The Effects of Emotion and Issue Involvement on Entertainment-Education Viewers Intention to Register as Cornea Donors,Message Strategies: Involvement,"This study was designed to examine the role of emotional responses to an Entertainment-Education show about cornea donation, issue involvement, and the three components of the Theory of Planned Behavior, in predicting intentions to pledge cornea donation. The decomposition of effects for the latent constructs confirms that sympathy and empathy responses are the catalyst for issue involvement in the context of organ donation, and issue involvement is an important intermediary in the persuasion process. Issue involvement is also a common causal antecedent of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. The findings of this study suggest that adding emotion and involvement in the Theory of Planned Behavior enhances the explanatory power of the theory in predicting intentions, which indicate the possibility of combining the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior in the prediction of human behaviors. This study also emphasizes the importance of emotion and issue involvement in identifying the why and how issue of the Entertainment-Education investigations."
2006-1360,The Effects of IMing and TxtsgN on Adolescent Social Networks,The Uses and Effects of Media among Adolescents,Instructional & Development Communication,,,Paper,The Effects of IMing and TxtsgN on Adolescent Social Networks,The Uses and Effects of Media among Adolescents,"Building on previous research in computer-mediated communication, social and communication networks, and adolescent development, this paper raises three issues regarding adolescent use of socially interactive technologies (SITs) and the effect on their offline social networks: 1) whether adolescents are creating more, but weaker ties using SITs, 2) to what extent adolescent SIT-facilitated networks overlap with friendship networks, and 3) whether SIT relationships are important for adolescents who have fewer offline peer ties. In order to investigate these questions, this research integrated network data collection and analysis with more traditional questionnaire questions and statistical analysis. The results of the research point to a very complex dynamic between offline and SIT-based friendships, with larger-scale, overtime data collection needed in the future to try to better understand the relationships between the networks."
2006-1361,The Effects of Message Arousal and Valence on Implicit and Explicit Memory of PSAs,Understanding the Role of Emotion in Processing Media,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,The Effects of Message Arousal and Valence on Implicit and Explicit Memory of PSAs,Understanding the Role of Emotion in Processing Media,"Public Service Announcements (PSAs) are one of the most commonly used methods in health campaigns. From an information processing perspective, a series of studies have investigated how emotional PSAs can affect recognition and recall. In those studies, memory was assessed by making explicit reference to a specific learning episode (e.g., PSA viewing) and require conscious recollection of it. However, memory research in psychology and cognitive neuroscience has distinguished two types of memory: explicit and implicit memory. Although implicit memory is viewed as one of the most exciting areas of memory research in the past decade or so, it has not captured enough attention in media research to date. Whereas, recent investigation suggests the potential importance of implicit cognition in risk behaviors and hence more research seems warranted. To address this, an experiment is conducted to explore how emotional valence and arousal of PSAs affect both implicit and explicit memory, and compares the similarity and difference in the effects of valenc and arousal on the two types of memories."
2006-1362,The Effects of News Coverage on the Cognitive Structure of the Audience,Advances in Research on News Effects II,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Effects of News Coverage on the Cognitive Structure of the Audience,Advances in Research on News Effects II,"This study focuses on the cognitive effect of media, based on the knowledge activation model proposed by Vincent Price. Repetitive and cumulative news coverage changes accessibility of the concepts within the knowledge structure of the audience, i.e. the structure of the associative network, and eventually changes the way the audience recognize certain issues.
The results suggested that as certain concepts were reported cumulatively and repetitively, the accessibility of such concepts within the associative network increased, showing relatively more chances of being activated than those less reported concepts. Same results were drawn from both the qualitative (frequency) and qualitative (pattern of usage) aspects of accessibility. It suggested that the media plays significant roles in the first step of the knowledge activation process, increasing the accessibility by the recency and frequency of the concept, implying the significant role of media effect in cognitive level."
2006-1363,"The Effects of Participative Management on Employee Commitment, Productivity, and Community Satisfaction in a Police Agency",Organizational Impacts on Employee Voice,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,"The Effects of Participative Management on Employee Commitment, Productivity, and Community Satisfaction in a Police Agency",Organizational Impacts on Employee Voice,"Police work has become more community and crime-prevention oriented. Many of these activities are discretionary thus demanding high commitment from police officers to their agency. Participative management is frequently associated with organizational commitment and performance, however, has not been widely adopted within law enforcement organizations. In this case study, we analyze the effects of implementing participative management within a suburban police department using quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, and archival data. Eighteen months after implementation of the new management approaches, employee perceptions of work conditions, communications within the agency and labor-management relations have significantly improved. Archival data reveal increased productivity compared to a 4-year period prior to the implementation, and community satisfaction with police services have improved as well. In qualitative interviews, interviewees attribute these improvements to the changed management practices. Questionnaire data confirm the relationship between participative management and affective organizational commitment which is mediated, as well as moderated, by perceived organizational support."
2006-1364,The Effects of Shared Opinions on Nonverbal Mimicry,Nonverbal Communication,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,The Effects of Shared Opinions on Nonverbal Mimicry,Nonverbal Communication,"People often mimic each other when they interact. Much research has examined the positive social benefits of mimicry, but less research has examined what factors may lead to increased mimicry of another person. The present study examines whether a participant is more likely to mimic the nonverbal behavior of someone who shares the same opinion as the participant than someone who shares a different opinion. The participant read about two different vacation destinations and chose one destination for a fictitious trip. The participant then discussed his or her choice in a three person group. The two other group members were actually confederates. One confederate agreed with the participants choice during the discussion and one disagreed. Further, each confederate emitted a different nonverbal behavior consistently throughout the discussion. Results support the hypothesis that the participant would be more likely to mimic the nonverbal behavior of the confederate who agreed with him or her."
2006-1365,The Effects of Social Information Through Communication Networks on Attitudes About Organizational Change,Knowledge Networks and Complex Systems,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,The Effects of Social Information Through Communication Networks on Attitudes About Organizational Change,Knowledge Networks and Complex Systems,"Contemporary organizations are constantly facing some degree of change in the fast-moving environment. Although organizations aim for better outcomes, not all changes produce favorable results, and immediate support from organizational members is critical for success. Social Information Processing (SIP) theory suggests employee attitudes are influenced by information available in the workplace. Yet, the theory does not provide the details on how social information is actually transmitted and processed. In order to describe the detailed process, a communication network perspective was incorporated into SIP theory in this study. Investigating both quantity and quality of social information through three different types of communication networks in a contemporary organization, data from 124 employees of a public library that was about to face budget cuts confirmed that the significant effect of both quantity and quality of social information from work-related networks on employee attitudes about change. In addition, those who access the Intranet more frequently and who read email more carefully tend to perceive information from the organization more useful, which, in turn, positively affects their attitudes. Further, the results showed that organizational knowledge serves as a mediator between the quantity of social information and attitudes about organizational change."
2006-1366,The Effects of Source Cue and Framing on Consumers' Web-Based Health Information Processing,Human Computer Interaction and Information Processing,Information Systems,,,Paper,The Effects of Source Cue and Framing on Consumers' Web-Based Health Information Processing,Human Computer Interaction and Information Processing,"The present study investigated how message source cues and frames affected consumers processes of Web-based health information. A 2 (nonprofit organization/corporate source cue) × 2 (gain/loss framing) factorial design was employed to examine the extent of treatment effects on participants perceptions, attitudes and intentions in responses to mock Web pages about obesity prevention and healthy diet. Participants were 232 college students.
The interaction effect between factors of message frame and source cue on change of fast food consumption intentions was found. Results also showed main effects of source cue on source credibility and negative emotional response, and message frame on risk perception. However, the present study did not find framing effects on food-related attitude changes. In conclusion, a nonprofit source has more opportunity to affect change in consumers than does a corporate source. Still, a corporate source may be able to influence consumer attitudes with appropriately framed messages."
2006-1367,"The Effects of Technological Advancement and Violent Content in Video Games on Player Arousal, Presence, and Aggression",Advances in Violent Video Game Research,Game Studies,,,Paper,"The Effects of Technological Advancement and Violent Content in Video Games on Player Arousal, Presence, and Aggression",Advances in Violent Video Game Research,"The possible impact of technological advancement on video games effectsparticularly in the case of violent gameshas often been discussed, but has not been thoroughly explored by empirical research. The present investigation employed a 2 X 2 between-subjects factorial experiment to examine the interplay of technological advancement and violence by exposing participants (N =120) to either a newer or older version of a violent or nonviolent game and measuring these factors effects on physiological arousal (measured by skin conductance), sense of presence, and affective and cognitive aggression. The results indicate that technological advancement increased arousal and participants sense of presence. Violent game content increased participants self-reported hostility after controls were taken into account. However, neither advancement nor violence had statistically significant effects on accessibility of players aggressive thoughts. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed, and recommendations are made with regard to future research."

The current study addresses this weakness through the exposition and initial testing of a theoretical model of threat appraisal based upon perceptions of situational demands and required organizational resources. Two key dimensions of threats in crises were proposed as threat type and duration, the effects of which were empirically tested on public relations professionals cognitive appraisal of threats, affective responses to threats and the stances taken in threat-embedded crisis situations.

A Web-based experiment on 116 public relations practitioners was conducted using a 2 (external vs. internal threat type) x 2 (long-term vs. short-term threat duration) within-subject design. The findings revealed the main effects of threat type and threat duration on threat appraisal, emotional arousal and degrees of accommodation. Interaction effects indicated that external and long-term threat combination led to higher situational demands appraisal and more intensive emotional arousal."
2006-1369,The Effects of Visual and Audio Information Density,Mediated Messages and Information Processing in Individuals and Groups,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,The Effects of Visual and Audio Information Density,Mediated Messages and Information Processing in Individuals and Groups,The average number of structural onsets per second is used as an indication of structural complexity. Two measures of information introduced by structural features--one for auditory structure and one for visual structure--are used to quantify information density. Then an experiment is conducted to test predictions of variations in these two variables on secondary task reaction time measures and recognition memory.
2006-1370,The Efficacy of News Browsing,Advances in Research on News Effects I,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Efficacy of News Browsing,Advances in Research on News Effects I,"Research on audience uses of news media points to the presence of two different types of audience news gathering processes: information browsing and information selecting. The former refers to choosing a broad range of news topics when using the media, while the latter refers to the practice of limiting ones news consumption to one or two topics. The existing literature in this area has not examined the antecedents of these behavior patterns and has still to determine whether users reading styles have normatively important consequences for audiences. The present study uses survey data and to address both of those gaps. The study finds that news browsing is associated with reliance on a medium for news. News browsing, in turn, predicts the variety of topics about which people are informed, their social self-efficacy, and their internal political efficacy. The implications of the findings for understanding news consumption behavior are considered."
2006-1371,The Emergence of Diffusion Theory in Latin America: A Critical Analysis,Development Communication: Questioning the Discourse,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,The Emergence of Diffusion Theory in Latin America: A Critical Analysis,Development Communication: Questioning the Discourse,"Diffusion of Innovation is one of the theories most widely studied and applied in different contexts all over the world. However, this is not the case in Latin American countries. Most of the literature that deals with Diffusion of Innovation maintains a critical approach. This paper reviews the way that earlier diffusionist studies were carried out and applied in Latin America. Four intellectual constructions that were pervasive in the mainstream American academy (the dominant paradigm, the linear conceptualization of communication, the modernization theory and the notion of powerful effect) left a mark on the earlier diffusion theory that guided its application in a concrete direction in the region. However, it seems that the application of the theory in the continent left a type of stigma that held new Latin American scholars away from this practical and popular theory."

In the new millennium, 'celtic tiger' Ireland has shifted from being a nation of net emigration to becoming a relatively significant migration destination. Despite the public and academic debate occasioned by this transformation, scant attention has been paid to the cultural practices and media micro-economies of different diasporic formations often reductively referred to as the 'new Irish'. This extended abstract suggests that both the Irish public sphere and Irish media analysis has been to an understandable extent preoccupied with questions of representativity and multiculturalism, but to the cost of a research agenda that examines the finegrain of new media networks that may well bypass the integration-oriented questions dominant among majority commentators. In presenting this research project at its outset, I aim to present at the conference a grounded research agenda for this new area in irish media sociology."
2006-1373,The Epistemology of Media Effects: An Analytical Essay,Criticial and Analytical Persectives on the Media,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Epistemology of Media Effects: An Analytical Essay,Criticial and Analytical Persectives on the Media,This study investigates the continuing production of media effects research that focuses on the media violence and aggression (MV/A) relationship. It does so by analyzing the nearly 80 year connection between media effects and cognitivism. It argues MV/A is as much an artifact of its cognitive epistemology and the cultural demand for simple solutions to complex social problems as it is to any true relationship between the viewing of violence and socially significant aggression. It concludes by claiming that MV/A can be seen as a middle-class project that deflects social policy from difficult and ideologically costly programs of social reform.
2006-1374,The Ethics of Interpretation and Analysis in Journalistic Writing,Ethical Issues in Journalism,Journalism Studies,,,Paper,The Ethics of Interpretation and Analysis in Journalistic Writing,Ethical Issues in Journalism,"Despite the presence of interpretive elements across forms of journalistic writing, little scholarly work has focused on interpretation and analysis from an explicitly ethical perspective. This paper examines the ethics of interpretation and analysis in journalistic writing, based on interviews with 60 writers and editors at three large U.S. newspapers  the Los Angeles Times, the Portland Oregonian, and the Dallas Morning News. This analysis is principle-based, focused on a notion of truth that encompasses issues of context and depth of insight, as well as factual accuracy. The analysis encompasses five kinds of interpretive language: unattributed factual statements, summation of findings (especially investigative reporting), explanation of complex matters, statements assessing meaning or significance (in both news and features), and statements of opinion. Particular care on the part of journalists is warranted in handling the unstated interpretive aspect of pieces not labeled interpretation, as well as the knowledge base underlying overt opinion."
2006-1375,The Ethics of Outing Gays in the Media: A Communitarian Perspective,dentity and Spheres of Difference,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,The Ethics of Outing Gays in the Media: A Communitarian Perspective,Identity and Spheres of Difference,"Journalists argue that disclosure and debate about outings serve a greater social good. But traditional journalisms amoral craft values of prominence, conflict, and controversy dont always meet fundamental ethical obligations of truth, justice, and equality. Its arguable that outing in the press represents a callous disregard for the potential harmfulness of unwanted publicity about an athletes private life. Those problems are not produced by media discourse alone. But longstanding media practices contribute to such hegemonies through the traditional reproduction of ideas and construction of social realities. Communitarianism is a radical social ethic based on notions of justice, covenant, and empowerment. The primary duty of journalists and others, according to communitarianism, is to treat all with dignity and care and to minimize harm. For journalists seeking an ethical rationale for the higher discourse in cases of outing, communitarianism presents a morally useful alternative to the traditional libertarian/utilitarian ideals of press practice."
2006-1376,"The Face of Online Information Processing: Effects of Emoticons on Impression Formation, Affect, and Cognition in Chat Transcripts",Human Computer Interaction and Information Processing,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,"The Face of Online Information Processing: Effects of Emoticons on Impression Formation, Affect, and Cognition in Chat Transcripts",Human Computer Interaction and Information Processing,"The multiplicity of venues that the Internet offers for social interaction has led to a sustained body of research in computer-mediated communication (CMC), with a prominent body of scholarship examining the efficacy of distinct non-verbal cues that can help CMC approximate the feel of face-to-face (FtF) communication. One such cue that enjoys ubiquitous use in several online communication environments is the emoticon. Despite their prominent presence, however, little experimental research has examined the psychological effects of emoticons in popular online scenarios. We examine the interplay of emoticons with the gender of the person using them and also explore whether the type of topic under consideration makes a difference. We report results from a fully crossed, 2 (emoticons present, emoticons absent) X 2 (male, female) X 2 (serious topic, non-serious topic) between-subjects factorial experiment (N = 120) and show that the experimental manipulations have an influence on impression-formation, affect, and cognition. The findings have theoretical implications for CMC research and offer a promising direction for future inquiry."

Portraying KKK leaders as corrupt, prurient, foolish, and dangerous, the FBI succeeded in undermining support for the clandestine organization among those within and outside its ranks. Its use of cartoons ridiculing Klavern leaders, Wizards, and other exoticized figures contributed to public attitudes of derision for the culturally marginal practices of the Klan. Managing press coverage of the Klan also contributed to the public communication campaign that helped defeat in the public sphere a foe drawing upon considerable cultural capital in its fields of operations."
2006-1378,The Female Face of Poverty: Media and the Gender Divide in the Millennium Development Goals,Where Women Live: World Circumstances Complicating Lives,Feminist Scholarship,,,Paper,The Female Face of Poverty: Media and the Gender Divide in the Millennium Development Goals,Where Women Live: World Circumstances Complicating Lives,"2005 is a banner year for global partnerships and transnational feminist dialogues. It is the ten-year anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing and also the fifth anniversary of the United Nations ongoing Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), regarded by international leaders as a unifying framework which sustains the Beijing and other social agendas. The MDGs, what the UN calls a measure of political will, may be perceived as a switch from traditionally patriarchal or Orientalist approaches which construct culturally victimized other women requiring help as opposed to people being actively engaged in decision-making. Instead, MDG principles require participatory dialogue among countries so that results address needs. Using feminist framings, this study examines news agency reporting of more than 2,000 reports that specifically mention ""Millennium Development Goals"" from five international news agencies. Two are western agencies -- the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse. Two are based in developing regions -- the PanAfrican News Agency and China's Xinhua agency. The fifth is Inter Press Service, an independent NGO that specializes in news relevant to developing regions. The reports cover a 19-month period from the World Social Forum in January, 2004, to the end of the UN Summit in September, 2005. The analysis includes news geography, topics, and actors; for instance, we determined the amount of attention to feminist issues accorded by each agency. While this study explores links between women, social issues, and the media, it also directs attention to new identities and agendas emerging from MDG coverage."

A national sample survey (N=363) showed that problem recognition about bioterrorism was positively related to information seeking and information processing. Constraints recognition was negatively related to information seeking and information processing. Involvement with bioterrorism was found to be positively related to information seeking as the theory predicts. This study segmented the public into four types based on people's knowledge of and involvement with bioterrorism, and examined key characteristics of these publics, such as their media consumption habits, their trust evaluations of information sources, and their propensity to exhibit specific behaviors in case of attacks."

It does so by way of critical interpretation of accounts of the global spread of English published in five American-owned prestige press publications--the Los Angeles Times, the International Herald Tribune, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. Part of a 275-text data pool generated for a forthcoming dissertation, the texts discussed and analyzed in this paper wrap the story of the global hegemony of English around Anglo-Franco competition and rivalry. They embrace what the author calls the French Foil narrative, or a story about the global hegemony of English that pits English against French, the United States against France, and Americans against ""the"" French. Generally, the story told is one in which English is triumphing over French because of its superior status as a popular language. This anti-elitist plot line relies in particular on the consummate antagonist of American populism, the French intellectual."
2006-1381,The Global and the Local: A Cross-National Study of Computer News Sites,News Contents in International Perspective,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Global and the Local: A Cross-National Study of Computer News Sites,News Contents in International Perspective,"This paper compares news coverage among international computer news websites in order to shed light on issues of global news flows and to explore the tensions between the global and the local, an issue that often relates to identity issues (Castells, 1996; Hall, 1996). Four sites were chosen, from the US, Spain, Switzerland, and Japan. Each is in a different language (English, Spanish, Swiss-German, and Japanese), yet each also uses computer jargon. They are all different, yet all use the same code to run their sites (facilitating comparison).
One weeks stories from each site were collected, translated, and compared. It was expected, given the interconnectedness of the Internet and other factors of computer news, that the sites would often carry the same story. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the sites would all carry a core set of important stories. Surprisingly, neither of these hypotheses were supported, repeating the findings of a 1953 UNESCO newspaper study. It was also hypothesized that the Western sites would be more alike in terms of stories covered, and that the European sites would have more stories in common than with the other sites. Findings, however, we mixed. Other issues that were explored include findings about cross-site linkages in stories that were covered by more than one site, and an exploration of languages and linking in such stories."

The author zeroes in on examples of explicit reflection upon the American ""situation"" vis-a-vis the global hegemony of English. These are drawn from a 275-text data pool generated for a forthcoming dissertation. A number of different themes emerged in texts and textual excerpts analyzed. The most prominent was that of English monolingualism as potentially compromising American national security and economic competitiveness. Several texts also focused on a great paradox: tremendous American linguistic diversity and widespread English monolingualism in the U.S. Perhaps the most interesting theme was what the author terms wistful regret: Americans reflecting with considerable melancholy on the ways in which they saw the hegemony of English as inhibiting their incentive and opportunity to become multilingual."
2006-1383,The Great Stir Caused by BSE: Interpersonal Influence in Rural Social Networks,fluence in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication,,,Paper,The Great Stir Caused by BSE: Interpersonal Influence in Rural Social Networks,Influence in Interpersonal Relationships,"In the following survey congruency within a sample of 150 rural social networks ascertained by comparing independently gathered data has been used as indicator for interpersonal influence concerning BSE-related current knowledge and consumption habits. Only poor support has been found for the thesis that interpersonal influence is particularly strong concerning attitudes. Our data suggests at least that information exchange through communication partners within social networks is not relevant. However, friends, relatives and acquaintances coorientate each other about what is worth knowing about BSE. In that sense our results indicate that it is important to a certain degree with whom somebody has talked to and is connected with. Concerning the consumption habits our results indicate that interpersonal influence had played a certain rule. However, the influence is mainly limited to villagers who decided to continue eating beef. For those, who have stopped, interpersonal influence is of less importance."

It is setting of limitless spiritual and emotional tales, idealized family values, and maternal acceptance and approval: it is the American Dream. Television is a dominant medium that narrates our cultural myths. After nearly a half-century of turning on living room television sets to enjoy stories of soap operas, crime dramas and comedy serials set in the home, in 1994 Americans were introduced to round-the-clock television programming about the homethat inclusive place that signifies self and the American Dream. The twenty-four hour, seven-day cable network, Home and Garden Television (HGTV), launched from its middle-America home base in Knoxville, Tennessee, skyrocketed in distribution both domestically and globally, and achieved profitability in a record four years to become one of the fastest-growing networks in television history. Key to HGTV's transformational message is its stories that focus on resolution and allow viewers to 'inject' themselves into its struggles and triumphs. To better understand this genre, this paper takes a historical look at mass medias service to women and domestic consumption in the United States, the media forms that gave impetus to the home-makeover genre, and the creation and influence of HGTV on our cultural landscape."

To this end, photos and sketches printed in 11 Korea-related books written by missionaries, diplomats, and scholars were collected, categorized and analyzed. To clarify the contents of photos, the explanations written in the books were used as reference. As a result, total of 349 photos were collected and were categorized by several types and themes. First, they were divided into people, life, landscape, custom and institution. The groupings of such photos represented where the interests of the Westerners were. Also, these topics had some common messages, which could be expressed as pre-modernity, historicality, absence, and eccentricity. The description of the child without care, spiritless woman, people engaged in simple labor, disordered and messy market or wash place, primitive form of traffic, womans dress with exposing breast, and superstitious behavior could be recognized as uncivilized when looked by the people unaware of Korea"

With a population of over one billion, the HIV epidemic in India will have a major impact on the overall spread of HIV in Asia and the Pacific, and worldwide. This article discusses the impact of a mass media entertainment-education campaign to prevent HIV/AIDS in three low HIV-prevalence north Indian states, New Delhi, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. We used three waves of data from an evaluation study to measure the effects of a mass media, entertainment-education campaign to prevent HIV/AIDS. Results showed that individuals who were exposed to the campaign were more likely (1) to be aware of condoms, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV/AIDS, (2) to know about the sexual routes of HIV transmission, (3) to have fewer misconceptions about HIV transmission, and (4) to talk to others about STIs, condoms, HIV/AIDS, than those who were not exposed to campaign messages. The impact of the campaign was limited with regard to changing condom-use behaviors."

The project asserts when linguistic, economic, political, judicial and cultural pressures mount members of the enclave react differently to the pressures. Older members of the community perceive their linguistic comfort zone as shrinking, while younger members perceive their linguistic comfort zone as increasing in size."
2006-1405,The Impact of Internet News Consumption on Mass Media Use,Advances in Internet Research,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Impact of Internet News Consumption on Mass Media Use,Advances in Internet Research,"The goal of this study is to document empirically the growing impact of Internet news consumption on traditional news usage. Data for this study comes from four nationally representative telephone surveys conducted among American adults in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004. Each of the surveys contains the same questions regarding respondents exposure to news on television, newspapers, radio, magazines, and the Internet. The findings show that the consumption of Internet news does not decrease the time spent with traditional news sources, even among those most likely to be affected. In all four surveys that were conducted between 1998 and 2004, Internet news consumption correlated positively with the use of traditional news sources. Overall, this indicates that heavy Internet users are supplementing rather than displacing their overall news consumption with time spent on the Internet."
2006-1406,The Impact of Labeling on Children's Comprehension of and Responses to Web-Based Advertising,Advances in Advertising Research I,Mass Communication,,,Works in Progress,The Impact of Labeling on Children's Comprehension of and Responses to Web-Based Advertising,Advances in Advertising Research I,"While much is known about the ways that children respond to and understand television advertising, comparatively little is known about these issues as they relate to Internet advertising. Evidence is mounting that, not only are children spending more and more time online at earlier ages, but that advertisers are increasingly using the Internet as a marketing tool to target children. As such, children are exposed to numerous ads online while little is known about children's understanding of these ads. Specifically, we do not know if children are able to identify ad content on the web or if they recognize the persuasive intent of Web-based ads. The studies proposed here address this in two ways: First, by conducting a content analysis of Web-based advertising that targets children we can determine how many ads on popular Web-sites contain labels identifying them as advertisements. Second, by conducting an experimental manipulation using labeled vs. unlabeled ads, we can determine the extent to which such labels aid children in identifying advertising content and making attributions of persuasive intent."

2006-1408,The Impact of Structural Complexity and Information Density on Attitudes Toward Radio PSAs,formation Systems Interactive Paper Session,Information Systems,,,Extended Abstract,The Impact of Structural Complexity and Information Density on Attitudes Toward Radio PSAs,Information Systems Interactive Paper Session,"This study seeks to examine the influence of structural complexity, defined as the frequency of structural features, and information density, defined as the amount of information introduced at the moment of structural onset, on the persuasive effectiveness of radio PSAs. A line of research has examined the effects of structural complexity in television and radio messages, such as cuts, edits, voice changes, and onset of music. Content features such as difficulty, arousal, and information density have also been found to influence information processing. The Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing has provided the theoretical background for those studies (Lang, 2005). According to this model, effects of content and formal features depend on the resource capacity available in audience members. Whether or not sufficient resources are available to process a message over time leads to dynamic results in different contexts. This study focuses on how the findings of the LC4MP can predict persuasiveness of the Radio PSAs.
Predictions in this study are also guided by two other theoretical approaches, the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Caccippo, 1986) and an adapted model to advertisements (Yoon et al., 1995). Whereas the LC4MP focuses on cognitive subprocesses such as encoding, storage, and retrieval, the ELM manifests the different routes (central and/or peripheral) to form an evaluation of an issue object. From this, the present study seeks to examine how structural complexity and information density impact central/peripheral processing in evaluating of Radio PSAs and how involvement moderates the impacts."
2006-1409,The Impact of the Socioeconomic and Political Environments on Public Relations in Mexico,Public Relations Top Papers,Public Relations,,,Paper,The Impact of the Socioeconomic and Political Environments on Public Relations in Mexico,Public Relations Top Papers,"The evolution of public relations in Mexico has accelerated since the establishment of the North America Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada. This advancement is attributed to the practices of transnational corporations and the democratization process that motivates openness, greater professionalism and the expansion of public relations across diverse organizations. Nonetheless, the profession faces some challenges: the unequal wealth distribution creating large and growing pockets of poverty and social exclusion, and media reports of political and business scandals have diminished the trust in institutions. Mexican citizens and the professional community are rejecting corrupt and anti-democratic practices because of the perceived need to re-legitimize organizations immersed in a process of democratic change. Public relations professionals invest efforts to adopt a relevant role for the advancement of democracy. Embracing ethical practices is a priority to carry out government and media relations.

This qualitative research on the socioeconomic and political environments of public relations in Mexico documents how a national context influences the practice and the professional. Twenty in-depth, semi-structured interviews each 90 minutes on averagenine women and 11 menwere conducted in Mexico City and Cancun in July 2004. Participants were university-educated, ranging in age from 27 to 74, with top managerial responsibilities and representing government, private and nonprofit organizations. Both global and local socioeconomic and political forces should be considered for comparative and longitudinal studies because nation states and the public relations sector face greater regional and cross-national interdependence."
2006-1410,The Impact of Video Source Labeling on the Perceived Credibility of the News,Credibility: Advances in Research,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Impact of Video Source Labeling on the Perceived Credibility of the News,Credibility: Advances in Research,"The use of government-supplied video news releases (VNRs) in the production of television news has been making headlines over the past year. Most of the concern over the practice centers on the frequent failure of VNR producers and users to notify news viewers that portions of a storyor even the entire storyhas been provided by an outside organization. This paper reports the results of an experiment designed to determine whether news audiences would become aware of the VNR content were it labeled and whether it would affect their perceptions of the credibility of the news and the VNR provider. The results suggest that news audiences did not use the fact that VNR content was present as they evaluated the news and the news program. However, there is evidence that news audiences are concerned about the use of VNR content and support the use of labels in certain circumstances."

Among them, media plays the role of communication and cultivation that shouldnt be disregarded. Discussions on family education and management however focus mainly on the individual members personal interaction during socialization. (Primitive family, school, peers etc) The field of media delivering family concepts and value formation, especially the influence of internet on Chinese immigrant family communication or interpersonal relationship has been left out.
As families with internet access rapidly become universal, internet has changed many families life styles including purchase habits, parent-son relationships and the balance between family and work. Considering this, this research uses the depth interview, interviewing 51 Chinese immigrants from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China to Vancouver, Surrey and Richmond and probe into these questions:
1. What are the family communication networks of the Chinese immigrant family?
2. What is the Chinese immigrant familys relationship between parents and children?
3. What are the effects of the internet to the communication networks of Chinese immigrant family?
4. What are the effects of the internet to Chinese immigrant familys relationships between parents and children?

According to the results, the Chinese immigrant families family communication networks include the Chain network, the Y-network, the wheel network, the all channel network wineglass network, the button network and the bow tie network."

The results (through combined quantitative and qualitative data analyses) showed that (1) there was a significant, positive relationship between the experience of bungae participation and the perception of interpersonal relationship, (2) there was a statistically significant difference in the perception of sense of presence in their interpersonal relationships between online and cyber groups. Moreover, qualitative data analyses (through the interviews) suggests that providing nonverbal interaction in physical contact, the interconnectedness played an essential role in facilitating emotional attachment and commitment for developing and maintaining interpersonal relationships in online groups.
The implications of bungae as a symbol of interconnectedness within the Korean cultural variances were disscused"
2006-1413,The Importance of Ritual in Crisis Journalism,"Crisis Journalism, Terrorism, and Natural Disasters",Journalism Studies,,,Paper,The Importance of Ritual in Crisis Journalism,"Crisis Journalism, Terrorism, and Natural Disasters","The mass media are expected to play a key role in providing relevant and accurate information during a crisis. While numerous studies of crisis communication have explored how well the media perform in providing information during crises, less attention has been given to journalisms ritual aspects, such as those related to remembering, celebrating, mourning and sharing among members of a community. According to the culturalist tradition, journalism is as much about ritual and meaning-making as it is about providing information. One of the most important ways of performing this ritual function is through live, on-the-spot journalism - a form of journalism that has becoming increasingly common due to technological advances, and at the very least, it is connected with crisis news coverage. Based on interviews with broadcast media journalists about their decision-making strategies and motives during two crises, (11 September 2001 and the Anna Lindh murder in 2003), we link crisis communication with journalisms ritual and symbolic functions and the increasing emphasis on live, 24-hour news culture. We argue that key journalistic strategies such as immediacy and competition are motivated just as much by rituals related to affirming community and journalistic organisational needs as by informational motivations."

A descriptive study design is used to explore the experiences of gay college students in Taiwan, who participated in gay sex websites as a way to develop their sexual identity. It seems reasonable to conclude that gay sex websites influence on the sexual identity development of gay college students in Taiwan, and the gay sex websites are places where they learned and were taught to be gay when using the Net. In this study, the gay college students were using gay sex websites to socialize, realize themselves, develop friendship networks, and even find long-term romance. Furthermore, gay sex websites served an anonymity way for gay college students to come out and transfer into a gay lifestyle. It may be worth pointing out that the researchers who work with Taiwanese gay college students can expand their concept of the online and offline gay community, or social context. Due to the gay community continued to be as a minority in Taiwan, the impact of social conventions and constructs around gender and sexuality can be viewed as paramount in our understanding of identity and how it is formed in the Confucian society."
2006-1415,The Influence of Geopolitics and Foreign Policy on the U.S. and Canadian Media,Foreign Policy and Media Communications,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,The Influence of Geopolitics and Foreign Policy on the U.S. and Canadian Media,Foreign Policy and Media Communications,"The United States and its media have exerted strong influence on Canada and its media. However, the salient difference of foreign policy (multilateralism  Canada, unilateralism  the U.S.) raises the question of whether major medias coverage of each nations foreign policy is similar or not. If geopolitical proximity is a stronger factor than the policy difference, then media coverage of the two would be similar to each other. If this is not the case, then the difference of the two media would be evident.
With content analysis and semantic network analysis of New York Times (U.S.) and Globe and Mail (Canada) on the issue of Sudans domestic conflict, the authors found that 1) both newspapers focus on the conflict itself and Sudans need of international aid, but 2) Canadian newspapers coverage focused more on multilateral/international help and peoples suffering from the conflict than the U.S. medium. Therefore, it may be concluded that geographical proximity exerts a limited effect on the coverage of Canadian foreign policy. Suggestions for future research are addressed."

The findings reveal that in covering the women Cabinet members in South Korea, female reporters use a more positive tone, emphasize conflict news value less, use less stereotypical references to women and employ more gender sensitive perspectives than do male reporters. This study also found that organizational characteristics of newspapers might be related to their news content. The stories from the newspapers with a relatively high percentage of female members use a more positive tone about women Cabinet members than do those with a low percentage of female members."

The study focused on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of pre-teems and teens aged 11-15. A unique feature of the study was the paired sample of adolescents and their parents or guardians. The results showed that adolescent respondents attention to smoking information in the media was positively associated with the level of discussion about tobacco use in their family. Meanwhile, attention to information in the media was found to serve as a stronger predictor of adolescents perceptions, attitudes and behaviors about smoking and tobacco use than communication with their parents or guardians. In particular, the results suggested that television was a powerful channel for delivering antismoking messages to youth."

In two separate waves, pre- and post-message measures, assessing quitting intention and perceived behavioral control, were taken from current cigarette smokers (N = 151), with varying levels of nicotine dependence. The messages emphasized either benefits of quitting (positive frame), or cost of not quitting (negative frame). Results show that smokers intentions to quit smoking and nicotine dependence jointly influence the persuasiveness of positive and negative message frames. When nicotine dependence and quitting intention are both high, a negative frame works best. Conversely, when nicotine dependence or quitting intention is low, a positive frame is preferable. Smokers level of processing is proposed as the underlying mechanism explaining this differential effect of message frames."

In particular, a positive relationship between the influence of parents communication and their adult childrens values, feeling of connection to the ethnic group, as well as their knowledge of and practice of Chinese traditions is hypothesized. Two hundred and twenty-eight respondents (mean age = 30.4) filled out measures for above concepts as well as measures to control for other influences such as the ethnic background of the living area, class mates, and friends. All hypotheses in regards to the influence of parental communication on their childrens ethnic identity were supported."

Our argument rests upon recent advances in communication theory, stressing the influence on presumed media influence (Gunther & Storey, 2003) and contributes to our understanding of the mediatization of politics. Combined data from a survey of Israeli members of Knesset (MKs; n = 56), Knesset records of MKs political activity, and data on the frequency of MKs news appearances, were used to test this argument. Structural Equation Modeling revealed that politicians' belief in the power of media increases their motivation to appear in media coverage, which in turn is related both to greater media prominence and to more parliamentary activity. These results are discussed in light of their implications for both our understanding of political actors and for the role of journalists."

Results revealed unique patters of association for males versus females and for long distance versus proximal romantic partners."
2006-1422,The Integrative Framework for Effective Communication,Processes and Effects Studies,Information Systems,,,Paper,The Integrative Framework for Effective Communication,Processes and Effects Studies,"The integrative framework for effective communication (IFEC) describes nine communication strategies that are known from studies on advertising and integrates these with social-psychological theories to predict the most effective strategy to advertise a brand. The awareness strategy can be used to increase campaign awareness and brand awareness. The likeability strategy can be used to increase campaign likeability and brand likeability. The IFEC describes seven consumer need strategies, each addressing a different consumer need. These consumer need strategies can be used to increase purchase intention and purchase behavior. Findings from behavioral determinant models, attitude function theory, attitude base theory, and self-monitoring theory are discussed in view of the controversy of matching versus mismatching strategies. Based on these results, a method is outlined that can be used to define to chose the behavioral determinant strategy that most likely increases purchase intention and purchase behavior."
2006-1423,The Interactive Functions of Political Campaigning Websites in Networked Society,Advances in Internet Research,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Interactive Functions of Political Campaigning Websites in Networked Society,Advances in Internet Research,"This study compares interactive functions of multiple genres of political websites during Taiwans 2004 legislative election. Findings suggest that, in terms of human-to-content interaction, party websites appear to function as more effective channels for boosting voter support than candidate websites. Citizen and non-governmental websites appear to provide more human-to-human interactions with less resource base. The human-to-interface interaction generally appears to be downplayed in the 2004 legislative election. However, media websites appeared not to be interested in providing human-to-human interaction, either. Only citizenship websites seemed likely to fulfill the promises of the Internet for human-to-human interaction; but interaction of this kind lacks participation from candidates. Conclusions discuss implications for different interactive functions performed by various types of political websites for online political communication."
2006-1424,The Internationalization of Secrecy: A Look at Transparency Within the World Trade Organization,A Human Rights Approach to Access to Information,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,The Internationalization of Secrecy: A Look at Transparency Within the World Trade Organization,A Human Rights Approach to Access to Information,"Shifts from national and often democratic governance to governance by inter-governmental institutions raises issues regarding accountability and transparency. This study assesses the level of transparency within the WTO dispute settlement system and finds three categories of disclosure. First, there is official disclosure in which there is a formal process requiring disclosure. Second, there is information generated in the dispute process which requires no disclosure. Finally, there is unofficial disclosure, usually occurring through leaks to the media. Although various levels of disclosure exist, often disclosure occurs through unofficial and voluntary channels. This paper argues that this type of backdoor disclosure does not constitute an adequate level of transparency and that a comprehensive system of formalized, timely, and predictable disclosure needs to be created. As inter-governmental institutions proliferate and national governments give up more of their sovereignty to facilitate international cooperation, the need for greater transparency will only continue to grow."
2006-1425,The Internet and Rural Development: The UNDP Project in Western China,Global and Regional Internet Diffusion,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,The Internet and Rural Development: The UNDP Project in Western China,Global and Regional Internet Diffusion,"This study examines the UNDP-supported ICT Project for rural development at Tongnan County in western China. It aims to explore various factors that affect the Internet diffusion among the rural people and the implications that the Internet diffusion may have on the rural social and economic development. This study also addresses the issue of sustainability of ICT development in the rural context. Its ethnographic research design allowed the researchers to interact with the rural people under study and obtain first-hand data on their experiences in the Internet diffusion.

Tongnans experiences with the Internet show that the top-down project structure, the bureaucratic interventions, the prevailing mode of small-peasant economy as well as the disempowered administrations all contribute to the failure of this short-lived project. As the Internet does not come to the rural people as a natural stage of the economic and infrastructural development in the rural areas, its diffusion and usage are strongly influenced by the change agency, whose purposes to introduce the new technology shape the diffusion patterns of the Internet, which in turn mold the rural usage of the Internet and its implications for development."
2006-1426,The Internet as a Service Channel in the Public Sector,Determinants of Online Search Behavior,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,The Internet as a Service Channel in the Public Sector,Determinants of Online Search Behavior,"The Internet has been in use as a channel for public service delivery since the mid 1990s. During the first years of its existence it was believed to be the service channel of the future, making all other channels obsolete. But until now, the telephone and face-to-face contact remain being used more frequently and rated higher. By comparing various studies that have recently been conducted in a number of countries, this paper suggests that the characteristics of the channel make it a suitable channel for basic transactions and simple information provision, but that the telephone and face-to-face contact remain prevalent for at least ambiguous and complex tasks. Therefore the Internet might be a complementary channel rather than a substitute of traditional channels. Research findings are interpreted by means of Media Richness Theory, the Social Influence model and Channel Expansion Theory."

The researchers content-analyzed 484 op-eds written in 18 American publications. They detected 67 individual argumentative assertions - 25 in favor of war, 38 against, and four neutral. It was found that, contrary to much liberal opinion, the elite press was predominantly critical of the war. Simultaneously, the findings count against conservative complaints of a liberal bias in the elite media - the elite press most closely resem-bled the right-wing press in its argumentative patterns. In general, criticism was found to be muted, largely revolving around procedural concerns. The elite press de-emphasized considera-tions of a moral/humanitarian nature. We thus see hints of a troubling way in which the Ameri-can public sphere avoids what may be called ""macro-morality."""

This study explores the mechanisms that better explain the relationship between mass media and sources of social capital than what has been accomplished in previous research. We examine the effects of local news media, informational use of the Internet, and entertainment media use on sources of social capital, along with interest in neighborhood and community issues and interpersonal communication. Hierarchical regression analyses of a telephone survey data (n=546) show that the influence of local news media on sources of social capital was best reflected in their links to interest and interpersonal communication. In other words, the effects of local newspaper and television news on sources of social capital were mediated by interest in neighborhood and community issues and interpersonal communication. Searching information via the Internet was positively related to associational membership, even after controls of demographic and structural variables, interest, and interpersonal communication, whereas entertainment media use was not a predictor at all. The findings then suggest that use of local news media works through the values of self-interest in neighborhood and community issues and interpersonal communication to influence sources of social capital at the individual level."
2006-1429,The Korean Wave in Japan: Winter Sonata and Its Implications Through Audience Perception,Film and Television: Genres and Audiences,Mass Communication,,,Paper,The Korean Wave in Japan: Winter Sonata and Its Implications Through Audience Perception,Film and Television: Genres and Audiences,"This study explores why Korean television dramas strongly appeal to Japanese audiences through audience study. The purpose of this study is to articulate how cultural factors influence audience perceptions, and how social demographic factors dictate audience reception of certain media content. Ultimately, this research will empirically determine the validity of cultural proximity theory in Asia. Through 12 in-depth interviews in Japan, I have determined that Korean dramas appeal to Japanese middle-aged women is due to a fascination with the theme of pure love, rather than shared cultural values among Asians. However, the similarity of the Korean actors appearance, and the familiarity of traditional gender roles make Japanese audiences easily identify with the heroines in Korean dramas. In addition, nostalgia, cultural odour and the media industry also affected the Korean Wave in Japan. Thus, cultural proximity theory in Japan was validated in a way through this research; however, this research shows that cultural proximity theory was applied, based on gender, age, and cultural experiences. In order to elaborate cultural proximity theory, a variety of empirical studies should be done in different cultural settings with a wide range of subjects."

With the advent of digital technology, the focus of the privacy concept has changed to individuals right to control their information. In this essay, I explore why the individual right to control personal information is not enough to protect privacy in a meaningful way in a networked environment, given the interactive nature of the Internet and the voluntary nature of information activities of individual users. The greatest difficulty for individuals who become the object of surveillance in the current technological environment lies is that individual users' identities become more and more exposed, while subjects of surveillance and their activities become less and less identifiable. Given the power disparity regarding identifiability that always has existed between individuals and institutions and among different individuals, I argue that privacy should not only be an individual's right but also a social good with concerns for the public interest."

Specifically, it will compare and contrast how admen and adwomen, both working in China-based transnational firms and in local firms, negotiate the relationship between the local and the global, tradition and modernity, the West and China in their daily practices, and how they conceptualize their own opportunities, challenges and their roles in the current transformation of the Chinese society. Their consumption behaviors of material and nonmaterial goods will be further examined to see how consumption has shaped and constructed their imaginations and identities.
This study is significant in that it can contribute to an understanding of the movement of China toward a different kind of society, economically, politically and culturally. It will give us insight into the role advertising has played and is playing in Chinas gradual transformation into a consumer society, in addition to the social and political implications of such transformation. It will further facilitate our understanding of how local and global forces are playing off in the contemporary Chinese market."
2006-1432,The Local Media and International Conflict,"Media, Civil Society, and Conflict",Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,The Local Media and International Conflict,"Media, Civil Society, and Conflict","Although the local media are much more relevant to domestic and international conflicts, most studies have investigated the roles and coverage of the Western media. Moreover, international conflicts evolve through four distinctive phases: onset-prevention, escalation-violence, de-escalation-conflict resolution and termination-reconciliation. Most studies have investigated the medias roles in the violent and conflict resolution phases. Very few studies have examined these roles in the other two highly significant phases of prevention and reconciliation. This paper suggests a first step to fill the gap. It deals with functions of the local media in the two highly neglected phases of international conflict. It examines existing concepts and approaches and suggests a new approach based on the integration and application of theories from both communication and international relations."

I explicate when the terms evil and evil empire originated, and when - or rather whether - they ceased to function in Reagans rhetoric specifically and in the American political rhetoric generally. I employ a cultural-historical approach to rhetorical analysis, similar to Harts cultural forces lens (2002), and demonstrate that the concepts evil and evil empire begin in the origins of the American nation, as certain values, ideas, and ideals normatively associated with them were a defining part of the American history and culture. As such, these concepts are not limited to certain presidencies and their end cannot be defined. I evidence this by tracing the use of the term evil after 1983."

While much attention has been given to an examination of the conditions that are necessary for acquisition and the factors that can facilitate opportunities for negotiation (one particular form of social interaction), limited attention has been given to a longitudinal study of the relationship between negotiation and language learning. This paper reports on a study which investigated the extent to which successfully negotiated linguistic features were retained over a period of twelve weeks. The thirty pre-intermediate ESL learners who participated in the study were asked to repeat two different communication tasks (information gap and decision-making) one week and twelve weeks after their first performance. The study found that vocabulary items, particularly concrete nouns in the information gap task, were negotiated more often than pronunciation and grammar items. Noticing the gap between their problematic utterances and the feedback they received from their conversational partners, the participants immediately modified close to two thirds of these utterances, indicating that learning may have occurred. There was a high retention rate both one week and twelve weeks later for these negotiated items."

The paper asks whether, in the case of Y2K peoples perceptions of the risk, their trust in the media and other sources, and their readiness to take steps to avoid potential damages, were universal human-psychological reactions, or were depended on the persons socio-cultural community affiliation?

The findings of a national survey and several focus groups conducted in Israel prior to Y2K showed that despite exposure to the same media information, people from different cultural backgrounds (veteran secular Israelis, new immigrants from the former Soviet Union (henceforth FSU), and religious Jewish Israelis) perceived the risk differently and differed in their willingness to take steps to prevent damage."

Employing a 2 x 2 factorial design, findings reveal that use of humor can cause a disorganized speech to be evaluated as better organized than a serious disorganized speech and as comparable to a serious organized speech. By dividing attention, listeners seem likely to focus on the more attractive alternative. Also ratings of speech humorousness and audience members levels of sense of humor influence assessments of speech disorganization."

It was guided by the following question: what meaning do teenagers attribute to a popular television serial, and what is the role of identification, empathy en parasocial interaction in this process? We deliberately combined elements of two different scientific traditions: Cultural studies theorizing about the active audience and media psychological theories about the ways in which audiences use media content. The analysis of the transcripts of our focusgroup sessions showed that the perceived realism of the serial was crucial in the construction of meaning. It also became clear that viewers indeed empathized with the characters, but identified with them in a limited sense. Parasocial interaction resulted in relationships with characters in the series, but this did not lead to feelings of friendship for the characters."
2006-1451,The Micro Processes of Citizen Jury Deliberation: Implications for Deliberative Democracy,Local and Community-Level Perspectives on Citizen Engagement,Political Communication,,,Paper,The Micro Processes of Citizen Jury Deliberation: Implications for Deliberative Democracy,Local and Community-Level Perspectives on Citizen Engagement,"Despite the growing popularity of the citizen jury and other deliberative democratic approaches to public participation, there is no agreement on the method for evaluating them, nor even agreement on where evaluation should be applied, inputs, outputs or process. To evaluate its efficacy, this study convened a citizen jury to deliberate on waste management issues in a provincial Australian city.
After considering the theory of deliberative democracy, the paper identifies six criteria and applies relevant anlytical methods. The primary form of analysis is a sample of transcripts of jury deliberations used to examine the micro processes of the deliberative processes. This was supplemented by pre- and post-jury surveys as well participant observation.
The outcomes reveal that the micro-processes of jury deliberation were often characterised by unequal forms of interaction, poor focus on outcomes, and limited use fo available knowledge. Nonetheless, the paper argues that deliberative processes do have a role to play in contemporary democracies."
2006-1452,The Multiple Influence Model of Photographic Meaning,Theory Development for Visual Analysis,Visual Studies,,,Paper,The Multiple Influence Model of Photographic Meaning,Theory Development for Visual Analysis,"People learn much about the world through photographs. The sheer ubiquity of photographs conceals their constructed nature. People seldom stop to puzzle over them, to think about how and what they say. The seeming effortlessness and transparency of photographs masks a much more involved process, much of which occurs before the photograph appears in front of viewers. Some of this process lies within the head of the viewer, existing independently of any individual image. The photograph, thus, has many potential meanings depending on the production, viewing context and the viewer. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize a growing body of research on photographs and their meaning into a single model of how meaning is created from images  what I will call the multiple influence model of photographic meaning. As a tool, this model will provide the educator and researcher ways of relating seemingly disparate studies of photographic meaning."

Then it describes visual persuasion in particular, describing iconicity, indexicality, and syntactic indeterminacy as general means. It argues that architecture is a type of visual persuasion, with museums as a particularly useful example in understanding the culture and location in which they are located. The paper proposes a typology of museums, including museums as cultural icons, polemic, collective memory, partisan advocate, and pure visual persuasion. Finally, it illustrates the theory and the typology with an extended assessment of sever principal European museums, such as the Louvre, British Museum, Rijksmuseum, Dachau, Anne Frank House, and the like."
2006-1454,The Myth of Robert Johnson,"Myths, Branding, and Nationalism in Popular Music",Popular Communication,,,Paper,The Myth of Robert Johnson,"Myths, Branding, and Nationalism in Popular Music","The blues musician Robert Johnson (1911-1938) is the subject of an extensive literature, both popular and academic. Previous work has examined his biography, his musical style, and the historical dynamics of his posthumous reputation, including the personal, cultural, and financial interests of its promoters. This paper focuses on the myth itself as embodied in the stories told about how he learned to play guitar, lived, and died. The myth provides a case study in the popularity of magical thinking in regard to celebrity, artistry, and entertainment culture. Lessons are drawn from the case study for the literatures on myth and media, celebrity and reputation, and collective memory."

Scholarly literature and the popular press invoke metaphors like the glass ceiling and myths like superwoman. This essay expands Buzzanells (1995) earlier work by examining ethnicity dimensions of language frequently used to make meaning easily transferable about women and work outside the home in terms of effects; how certain speech acts incorporated in websites and major newspaper stories serve a discrediting function, dilute broader issues, and further entrench socialized norms and roles."

Central questions of the research projects presented are questions about the role of news media in referendum campaigns, and how news media cover the referendum process and the consequences of its intervention in this process. Although considerable research has tended to focus on influencing factors for voting behaviour and so the outcome of referenda, very little attention has been paid to the influences through media coverage. Furthermore, apart from very high normative demands on the information function of mass media in democratic societies, little is, however, known about the effective information performance of media coverage in referendum processes. So, both of the presented projects focus on one of the most important preconditions of direct democracy institutions: information performance of mass media in processes of direct legislation."

Spivak's 1932 Photographs, Undercover Reporting, and Fiction in Georgia Nigger","Photographs as Narrative, Myth, and History","John L. Spivak (1897-1981), whom Lincoln Steffens called the best of us among the many progressive and muckraking writers of Americas early 20th century is almost unknown today. Neglect may be due to his ideology. He was a thinly disguised communist and was blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Spivak was imprisoned for his alleged libelous writings. Perhaps neglect is due to his many violations of ethical standards in methods of investigation and reporting. Maybe he is not remembered because his investigative passions were spent on independent inquiries that led to sensational books and exposes in leftist media. He was at the center of many landmark cases, issues, and wars in American and international history. Spivak's documentary photography was carried on inside Georgia chain gang camps during the early 1930s. He published several images in Georgia Nigger, a fictional book based on his underground investigations. Spivak claimed that those on the chain gang, primarily African-Americans, were sometimes beaten or worked to death as a result of medieval-like methods of diabolical pain and punishment. Georgia Nigger had great public impact. Spivaks analysis occasionally is eerily relevant to issues raised by Abu Ghraib prisoner/detainee abuses by military guards in Iraq and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Spivaks photography is analyzed within the frameworks of aesthetics theory, visual rhetoric, reception theory, and the historical tradition of documentary photography analysis."

Due to the integration of key geospatial technologies (remote sensing - RS, geographic information systems - GIS, global positioning systems - GPS and the Internet) on-line disaster communities have grown. They include the traditional aspects of disaster recovery, mitigation, policy, and response as facilitated by governmental agencies and relief response organizations. However, the contribution from the public via the Internet has changed significantly. The on-line disaster response community includes several key characteristics: the ability to donate money quickly and efficiently due to improved Internet security and reliable donation sites; a computer-savvy segment of the public that creates blogs, uploads pictures, and disseminates information  oftentimes faster than government agencies, and message boards to create interactive information exchange in seeking family members and identifying shelters. A critical and novel occurrence is the development of networks of government, NGOs, private companies, and the public to build rapid response databases of the disaster area for various aspects of disaster relief and response using geospatial technologies. This paper examines these networks, their products, and their future potential."

First, the author introduces social semiotics as a discipline, by outlining its theoretical foundations, methodological principles and scholarly agenda. Second, the author discusses how more established paradigms (namely, semiotics, iconography and cultural studies) have approached the concept of ideology in visual signification. In doing this, the author also discusses how each of these paradigms has conceived of the process of signification in visual discourse. Thirdly, the author discusses the distinctive nature of the social semiotic approach to ideology in visual analysis, as this relates (in terms of differences and similarities) to each of the paradigms previously discussed. The author finally argues that the critical ends of social semiotics can benefit greatly from a closer  i.e. political  reading of Barthes ""Mythologies"" (1970/1990) as well as an increased concern with the role of perception in visual signification.

The paper poses questions that lead to critiques of mainstream development narratives and notions of innovation through diffusion of new technologies. Arguing that unless we examine processes of knowledge building in relation to epistemological processes that have embedded assumptions leading to inequalities in access to global and local markets, the authors ask for a careful reconsideration of how development work needs to be undertaken. We further suggest that the field of development communication must engage these intersections seriously in order to make a difference in the work of development praxis.
Two of the co-authors of this essay are NGO workers who have been working to develop alternate market paradigms for handloom weavers locally in India and are now in dialogue with the third author (and presenter of the paper) in trying to work out possible strategies for negotiating global markets. Their dilemma has been to try to negotiate the existing (contradictory) strategies for marketing handloom that suggests that handlooms must be marketed globally as exotic products associated clearly with a nostalgia for Gandhian Nationalism at the same time as the discourse of such a nationalism would suggest that even trying to reach global markets is undesirable. Framing handloom as exotic, however, does not feed the weaver and his/her family."
2006-1462,The Organization That Never Sleeps: A Metaphorical Pathology of Organizational Insomnia,Reframing Organizational Metaphors,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,The Organization That Never Sleeps: A Metaphorical Pathology of Organizational Insomnia,Reframing Organizational Metaphors,"The application of metaphors as a means to advance our understanding of organizations has a long-standing tradition in organization studies and organizational communication research, in particular. Generally speaking, metaphors allow for a description of organizational characteristics and functions in the terminology of another domain of interest. Anthropomorphic metaphors most commonly draw comparisons to the physiology of the human brain and the psychology of the human mind. At this, metaphorical understanding is creative rather than retentive, but it must follow a systematic approach in order to explore its theoretical value. Organizational learning and organizational memory are two prominent examples of anthropomorphic metaphors in organization studies. However, in the light of recent advancements in biology, neurology, and psychology, they lack the complementing metaphor of organizational sleep, given that sleep plays a particularly important role for the human minds processes of learning and memory. Based on the communication as constitutive of organizations (CCO) perspective (Castor, 2005; Cooren & Fairhurst, 2005) as well as the theory of social systems (Luhmann, 1995, 2000), this study re-contextualizes the metaphors of organizational learning and memory by illustrating sleep-wake cycles of organizational communication. In particular, the contrast between an ideal-typical 'healthy sleep organization' and an 'insomniac organization' leads to a reconsideration of existing theories of organizational learning and memory, on the one hand, and brings about new implications for the management of organizational communication, on the other hand."

Using live television as a critical case, the article suggests that the visual technology constructs a sense of artifactuality, which demands that we examine its material implication. Distinguishing itself from the hermeneutic approach that emphasizes the meaningful aspect of communication, the materiality of communication foregrounds the habitus of communication by focusing on technology as a social performance that objectifies a network of space, time, and the subject/object actants. The significance of technology in communication does not lie in its functionality, but should be recast in ways that manifest how technology affords socio-cultural practices."

An Essay,Technologies and Network Cultures,"The own in the foreignthis is how German philosopher Hegel explains our fascination with antiquity and exotic cultures. Their foreign nature surprises us, but because we discover ourselves in them as well, the surprise is bearable. This essay suggests that reliable surprises are also a major function of media use. Display, or push, media such as newspapers, television, movies, radio and magazines remain attractive because they offer professionally pre-sorted and contextualized surprises. Whereas research, or pull media such as the Internet leave it to us to cope with a principally unlimited and chaotic wealth of information and entertainment elements."

Yet, young people do not want news to be made deliberately more entertaining because it implies that news is no longer (important) news. Still many of them mainly watch news-like programs that they find entertaining. The double viewing paradox is that their satisfaction about and even interest in serious news does not automatically cause them to watch it, while, vice versa, their contempt for light news programs (stupid, junk) does not keep them from watching and enjoying them.
In a world of information excess the nature and experience of information is bound to change. This becomes evident first among members of the new generation. They are not so much looking for news and information as ends in themselves, but rather for inspiration, a sense of belonging and meaning to their life. Some critics have argued that we are moving towards an experience economy. How can or should todays news organizations, which have long relied on a straightforward facts-and-opinions approach, respond to an increasingly experience-oriented society? This article engages in a critical fashion with these new options and various changes by zooming in on the concerns of younger people in particular. This paper is based on 239 in-depth interviews, 148 news biographies and 65 online questionnaires and covers the media-experiences of 450 young people (between age 15 and 25, of different cultural and educational backgrounds) in the Netherlands."

Latin- American telenovelas have had phenomenal success in the post-communist countries in Eastern Europe. There has been an effort to localize the genre of telenovelas in some of these countries. The Croatian case emerges as a specific example because of the recent trend in domestic production of telenovelas. Looking at the political  economic aspect of this imported genre as being translated into the domestically produced Villa Maria could help us understand some of the logic of the global media flow, and expand on the still ongoing debate of cultural imperialism and contra-flow arguments.
Given the commercial development of the broadcasting scene and the subsequent rise of US- and Latin American-produced fiction, this paper asks, what is the impact of these phenomena on current Croatian productions? How much is domestically produced fiction even possible in given situation?"

These shows claim to be live, non-scripted and therefore real and rely on audience participation in the form of voting for favorite contestants. Some have hailed reality television as a harbinger of democracy in the Arab world. This paper explores the complex ways in which Arab reality television can be described as political and poses questions about the role of reality programs in the pan-Arab public sphere? Based on fieldwork, textual analysis, and interviews with television producers and market researchers, this paper concludes with preliminary observations on the political implications of Arab reality television."

Specifically, we address: (1) What are some of the manifestations of consumer nationalism in the Chinese market? (2) Why are such sentiments and expressions significant to corporate image and reputation of multinational businesses? and (3) How do multinational corporations deal with crisis situations like these? We demonstrate that, for Chinese citizen-consumers, the emotional power of nationalism is a critical component of the political marketplace in contemporary China, and continues to reflect Chinese peoples deep ambivalence about their encounter with foreign investment and goods. We discuss lessons learned through the cases and make recommendations on strategies for managing consumer nationalism in the Chinese market."

The Baghdad Blogger wrote about life in Baghdad as war loomed. The authentication of Salam Pax, his pseudonym, during the preparation for the invasion of Iraq first occurred in the blogosphere. Fellow bloggers debated whether he was real or a hoax. Supporters made their case. Later, those bloggers vouched for him when journalists investigated his credibility as a source during the invasion. For communications scholars, a case study of Salams authentication reveals the importance of the blog as a venue for mediated and interpersonal social interaction, as well as parasocial interaction. This paper explores through a qualitative analysis the creation of social affiliation through these relationships as Salams text was recontextualized from a blog to other media. Moreover, the popularization of Salam Pax illustrates how relationships between populations have been altered by the internet in wartime."

Following previous work on framing in campaign news, we posited that journalists frame the press in three ways, called conduit, strategy, and accountability. Participants in a between-subjects experiment were exposed to a campaign story about an exemplar character issue from the 1992 primary elections containing these frames. Regarding applicability effects, each frame activated frame-related thoughts. In addition, subjects exposed to the strategy press frame interpreted the press as being significantly more negative than individuals exposed to the conduit or accountability frame; subjects exposed to the accountability press frame interpreted the press as having higher quality than individuals exposed to the conduit or strategy frame. Regarding accessibility effects, only the accountability press frame prompted individuals to access attitudes about news performance to form opinions about negativity and quality."

It seems that a greater use of e-commerce is related to the availability at home of a large amount of computer equipment and equipment related to leisure which, at the same time, is compatible with the former. The best combination of predictors of Internet shopping are, in order of importance, use of e-mail, time spent watching television at weekends, use of the Internet and the use of a greater number of channels of the digital television service (repertory). The results of our research work are based on a survey involving personal interviews with members of 560 households in five Spanish cities who subscribe to a TV digital packet, by cable or satellite."

Given the WWW's reduced capacity to convey social cues, consumers interacting with other consumers in WWW-mediated networks need to manage audience impressions to appear trustworthy providers of information. This study investigates a corpus of product reviews published on a product-review Web site to uncover how writers of product reviews exploit impression management techniques to accomplish their communicative goals of influencing readers. Strategies employed by writers of product reviews include self-disclosure, credibility enhancement and the use of linguistic resources for self-promotion. The findings suggest that product-review Web sites need to provide participants with the technological means for self-presentation in order to build stronger social structures between actors."

While we have strong documentation regarding the stereotypes of Arab communities in US media, an empirical connection needs to be established between media experience and attitudes that might contribute to prejudice. This study focuses on the consequences of exposure to action-adventure film, in terms of prejudicial attitudes and knowledge of the Middle East. This genre of film is selected given its focus on acts of terrorism, falling within the confines of the stereotyped Arab, Muslim villain."

Most of the research on campaign web sites has focused on the first question. In this study, we apply the concept and measure of usability and employ laboratory user testing to assess the quality of user interface of the 2004 presidential campaign web sites. The purpose of the study is to advance our current knowledge and understanding of the usability dimensions relating to presidential campaign web sites through comparing the web sites of Bush/Cheney and Kerry/Edwards. Our analysis shows that, while the sites were professionally designed and equipped with standard functionality, they neglected certain user-centered features that could help strengthen user power, user convenience, and perception of information currency. The study derives both conceptual and managerial implications for the analysis and practice of political campaigning on the web."

In the process, many of the proactive measures taken by countries to manage DBS are elided from explanatory schemas. By exploring the international reaction to DBS, this paper aims to develop a framework for understanding attempts to corral this technology.
The first part of this paper evaluates the political, economic, and social concerns that motivate international angst about DBS. In exploring the stakes we can gain some insight into the motivation and actions of the actors involved in various DBS initiatives. This section is followed by a brief synopsis of Chan (1994) and Thomass (1999) classifications of Southeast Asian DBS policies, providing a structure from which to proceed. In order to explore the depth and diversity of DBS policy, brief profiles of the satellite-related actions of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Britain are then introduced. These case studies depict a range of action that, while constricted in some ways, is more complex than is conveyed by the previous schemes offered. In the process, the impetus emerges to create a new schema of national DBS responseswhich is delineated at the close of this paper."

A qualitative analysis of messages posted on a community blog (LANL: The Real Story) identified ways in which the blog was used both to express opinions related to past events (remedial voice) and give input on future actions (preventive voice). In addition, the study identified four values communicated in the blog (justice, honesty, courage, and science), as well as the ways that these values were used to challenge the legitimacy of the organizational authorities and contest distanciation."

The data generated several unexpected findings. (1) The Indians were most interdependent, followed by the Canadians and the Chinese. This result seems to contradict theories of I-C and Independent-interdependent self-construal that the Chinese culture is collectivistic and Canadian culture individualistic, and that the Chinese perceive the relational self more interdependently than Canadians (2) Females were more interdependent than males in the Indian and Canadian groups but not in the Chinese group. (3) In the Indian and Chinese groups, participants age was negatively correlated with closeness with friends, indicating that a persons attachment style changes over the life span. Results of past research using student samples need to be interpreted with caution. Findings of this study corroborate that culture is ever changing. To portray its intricate dynamics, new measures, developed from open-ended questions, in samples drawn from all age groups, are needed. To unpack the Chinese culture, data from rural areas and large cities within China would make meaningful comparisons"

Media channel credibility was defined as audiences perceptions of a news channel's believability, as distinct from the believability of the individual journalists and sources, media organizations, or the content of the news itself (Bucy, 2003). The constructs of brand equity (perceived quality, brand awareness, brand association, and brand loyalty) identified by Aaker (1991) were used to create a composite index of brand equity. A survey was self-administered by 225 respondents. The results show statistically significant bivariate correlations between media channel credibility and (a) brand equity, (b) perceived quality, (c) brand association, and (d) brand loyalty. The relationship between media channel credibility and brand awareness was not statistically significant."

Print Media Coverage of the Aileen Wuornos Case and Contemporary Discourses of Sex (Top Student Paper),Fighting Words: GLBT Representations in Mainstream and Minority Media,"While the case of Aileen Wuornos is ostensibly about murder it is undeniably also the case of a woman who made her living as a prostitute, was convicted of killing her johns, had a lesbian lover, and claimed a long history of sexual abuse. Because these aspects of Aileens life were discussed and debated during her trial, incarceration and even after her execution this case study is ripe for examining how knowledge about sexualities are produced. The constant reminders of Aileens status as a sex worker and the questions of how she ended up doing what she did, which dominate the coverage of her case reflect Michel Foucaults argument that repression does not function to silence us, but rather to incite us to speak voluminously and in particular ways and settings. Rather than displaying the undeniably and not unproblematically utopian quality about contemporary discussion of sex and sexuality that Foucault claims is characteristic of modern discourses of sex, in this case a central tenet of contemporary discourse of sex is actually the assertion that sex is a sin. Moreover, the print media coverage of Wuornos functions to produce a discourse of sex in which sex is not actually spoken about. What is talked about instead is evil."

After an overview of relevant literature, first a surveying research is presented about the occurrence of numbers in news articles. A starting point for further research is the idea that numbers  on a meta-rhetorical level  probably function as a device to increase the credibility or reliability of the news article and therefore of the medium.
In two experimental researches, we explored the persuasion force of numbers and statistics and we looked if there is any support for the hypothesis that numbers make a news article more reliable. The experiments showed that indeed readers tend to judge news articles with numbers as more reliable than articles without numbers. But only if they are instructed about the meaning of reliable and if they can make their choice on a two point scale."

The period covered was the week following a suicide bombing on Feb. 25, 2005, outside a nightclub in Tel Aviv. Words were coded as inflammatory or conciliatory. The 11 publications used 52,191 words in 102 articles to cover the bombing during that week. Inflammatory words exceeded conciliatory words by a margin of 2:1. Israeli newspapers used significantly more inflammatory words as a percentage of all coded words than the Palestinian newspaper and about the same as the other Arabic newspapers. The study is unusual for focusing only on regional newspapers, for emphasizing conciliatory as well as inflammatory rhetoric and for breaking out self-criticism as a separate category."

The Case Study of the Ruling by the Israel Press Council

The right to reply is one of the basic rights recognized by the media, and is viewed as a proper form of ethical behavior.

Press Councils usually have mechanisms for judging violators of ethics. The ruling can teach us how, in fact, the right to reply is interpreted de facto.

The paper analyses the ruling by the Israel Press Council since 1963. The analysis produced a taxonomy of practical aspects of this right and examines how the medias accountability mechanisms deal with them. The results can serve as a case study for journalistic ethics and its enforcement throughout the world."

Journalism authority and memory

This paper explores the question of journalistic authority in shaping collective memory through the analysis of Israeli daily newspapers that were published on the Holocaust Memorial Day in the years 1948-2000. The paper seeks to find to whom is society entrusting the authority to tell its most important stories and contextualizes this question within the specific case study of Israeli journalism and Israeli collective memory of the Holocaust.
The unique intersection between the sacred time (Holocaust Memorial Day) and the routine space (daily newspapers) creates Realms of Memory, which enable the exploration of the relative autonomy of journalism, as a field, and, at the same time, to explore its interrelations with the socio-cultural network within which it operates.
The paper suggests five main sources for gaining authority to tell the Holocaust story in Israeli daily newspapers: biographic, official, academic, cultural and journalistic. The findings indicate that only a combination of several sources could bestow the status of a dominant writer. Furthermore, over the 50 years studied, there were changes in the inner-hierarchy between the different sources.
The newspapers tended to give authority to external factors: survivors, politicians, intellectuals and others. The paper exposes the relatively weak autonomy of journalists in shaping collective memory and claims that the consecrated subject and the ""holy"" commemorative ritual delayed journalists from following the general trends of professionalism in Israeli journalism and from claiming sovereignty over their own field."

The primary methods of data collection were narrative interviews, participant-observation, and journaling. This study offers a detailed description of the process and patterns of communication students used to help them adjust and interpret life abroad. Specifically, students used 9 types of talk across the sojourn: Advice, superficial/introductory talk, information sharing, comparison, humor, story telling, gossip, complaint, and supportive talk. The results of this investigation indicate that everyday talk is essential in helping students adjust overseas."

The breakdown of effects for the independent and dependent variables confirms that issue involvement is an important intermediary in the persuasion process. Issue involvement is also a common causal antecedent of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Compared to non-viewers, viewers exhibited a significantly higher degree of involvement, attitude toward cornea donation, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention to pledge cornea donation. The findings of this study suggest that adding issue involvement in the Theory of Planned Behavior enhances the explanatory power of the theory in predicting intentions, which indicate the possibility of combining the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior in the prediction of human behaviors. This study also emphasizes the importance of issue involvement in identifying the why and how issue of the Entertainment-Education investigations."

It supports the general argument: involvement mediates the relationship between motivation and outcomes of Internet use.
The results of this study suggest that the most important predictors of Internet dependency are not demographics. Rather, motivation and involvement were the most significant predictors of Internet dependency. Such a finding corresponds with the proposition presented earlier: motivation and involvement have not received enough attention in previous media dependency research. So, rather than focusing on the impact of demographics on Internet dependency, researchers should pay more attention to peoples motivation for using the Internet, and their involvement with the Internet."

This article supplies a multi-level framework for the analysis of societal integration. I define societal integration as a multi-level phenomenon resulting from both social and system integration processes. Drawing on the arena/gallery model of public sphere, I theoretically elaborate the crucial role of national public spheres for European integration. I will argue that that the adoption of audience roles in the galleries of the national public spheres by EU citizens is one central precondition for European integration. By employing a comparative research perspective and by using multivariate regression analyses, I will analyze the impact of domestic media use of EU citizens on their feelings of participation in the political debate on enlargement."

Data from African American, European American, Hispanic, and other female ethnic/racial groups over the age of 40 were analyzed (N=2515). Results indicated differences across race for perceptions of patient-centeredness. Results also revealed that patient-centeredness is not predictive of compliance with mammogram recommendations. However, an explicit recommendation from health care providers to obtain a mammogram was a significant predictor of mammogram behavior. Implications of these results are discussed along with recommendations for future research."

In this paper, we focus on how a legitimacy crisis precipitated organisational identity reframing, in this instance, not just for one organization but for an entire industry sector. I
We critique the discursive strategies deployed by the New Zealand Government to legitimate biotechnology organisations, focusing on the way policy creating processes were deployed as a strategic resource (Hardy, Palmer and Phillips, 2000) to lend legitimacy to the identity transformation. Furthermore, we examine the connection between the government desire to prioritise the biotechnology sector and to transform the New Zealand economic discourse from commodity to knowledge and discuss the implications of government policy for identity studies. Our analysis concentrates on mapping and critiquing the discursive processes of policy production, policy consultation and negotiation, and the resultant strategy that may be deployed as resources for organizational identity. We thus theorise the way in which identity has to be legitimated during a societal controversy or crisis and propose a broader perspective of organizational identity that integrates an understanding of the intersection between government, society and identity work in the management domain."

Four segments from one standard episode of the weeknight cable news show The Situation with Tucker Carlson are transcribed and analyzed using theoretical elements from action-implicative discourse analysis, argumentation theory, and narrative positioning. The host has to balance competing demands from the guest, structure of the segment in which the guest appears, and the audience. These demands overlap in a way that the impact of the segment structure cannot be clearly identified. Avenues for further research are identified and discussed."

The soap opera is analyzed in terms of the genre attributes of plot, character, and consumption that coalesce in images of damaged women, who, nonetheless, have appealed to women audiences for half a century. Qualitative data collected from long-time viewers of four soap operas show that exposure to negative role models is detrimental to viewers personal life satisfaction, realistic assessment of life situations, and achievement of rational goals."

Multiple readings of the first five seasons of the series revealed various narrative, thematic, and visual elements that comprise the programs challenges to dominant ideologies concerning gender roles and race. Specifically, the study explores the use of historic context in the program to challenge ideologies concerning professional women and Native Americans. It was found that the representations of gender and race in Dr. Quinn generally acted to counter social stereotypes. Potential impacts of these representations and the narrative format on reality construction and meaning making in society are discussed."

The authors propose two views of the audience of the event. On the one hand, they explore a quantitative view in which data from television audience measurement are presented. The size and profile of the audience are analyzed, and the issue of solitary versus group viewing is addressed. On the other hand, the authors offer a qualitative view of the audience obtained through observation in ten homes. In this qualitative view of the audience issues such as the omniscopic impulse of the audience, the management of the celebration space at home, and the de-centering of the electronic ceremony are examined."

The study reviews: whether public relations practitioners in Latvia practice J. Grunig and Hunts (1984) press agentry, public information, two-way asymmetrical, and two-way symmetrical models of public relations; how former communist propaganda has affected contemporary public relations; and how public relations has contributed to political and economic transformation.

Long-interviews were conducted with ten Latvian public relations practitioners. The findings revealed that the four models of public relations were practiced in Latvia. Communist propaganda affected contemporary public relations. The field of public relations contributed to the political and economic transformation.

This study adds a Latvian perspective to the global theory of public relations. The study also provides practical implications for public relations practitioners by describing the ways political and economic contexts influence the practice of public relations in Latvia."

Twenty-seven qualitative interviews were conducted. Results show that 16 of the 25 MNC include their government affairs managers in strategic management. Government affairs contributes to the process by aligning their business goals with the development of policies and regulations. Government affairs managers play four roles in the process according to the level of regulation and the frequency of external environmental changes of the MNCs: the business developer, expert prescriber, senior advisor, and internal consultant. Government affairs specialists use direct and indirect sources to gather information relevant to environmental scanning. Results also suggest a positive relationship between the participation of government affairs in strategic management and excellence in government affairs. However, in addition to excellence in government affairs, organizational mechanisms of management, organizational expectation and culture, and the nature of the MNCs industry also affect the integration of government affairs with the overall strategic management. In short, in order to assist multinational corporations navigating in Chinas ever-changing environment, government affairs is more professional and strategic than a business of guanxi (personal relationships)."
2006-1517,The Structural Configuration of International Flow of Films: A Multilevel Network Analysis,Global Movie Flows,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,The Structural Configuration of International Flow of Films: A Multilevel Network Analysis,Global Movie Flows,"There are two opposing perspectives on the international flow of media products. One is that only a few advanced countries with overwhelming capability of producing and distributing media products have monopolized the global market of media and therefore the ideology of capitalism would spread out: it is called the Media Imperialism. The opposing perspective is that both the activeness of media consumers and the autonomy of individual countries not only decentralizes the monopolized international media market but also enable them to build their own regional blocks. These contradictory perspectives, based on their own empirical data and logical explanations, thus controvert to each other and consequently, fail to illustrate which view is more substantial. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to clearly identify the structural configuration of the international flow of media products, focusing on cinematographic film, one of the most representative media products, by using network analysis.
The results revealed several regional blocks based on geo-cultural proximity and reverse flow from developing and undeveloped countries to the advanced countries. However, those flows were insignificant and the North America-Western Europe block, including a few advanced countries, was seen to still dominate the whole network of film flow. These results reconfirmed that the media imperialism discourse is still valid to explain the contemporary structure of international flow of films."
2006-1518,The Structure of International Aid Flows and Global News Media,Foreign Policy and Media Communications,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,The Structure of International Aid Flows and Global News Media,Foreign Policy and Media Communications,"This study examines the structure of international aid flows in the global system and the relationship between news coverage and international aid allocations from a communication perspective. Generally, traditional perspectives on international aid have focused on the nation-state system, limiting explanation of international aid flows in the global system. World systems theory is proposed to explain the phenomenon. The results of a network analysis found: 1) international aid flows follow a core-periphery structure; 2) the relationships between donors and recipients reflect the structural characteristics of international interaction described by Galtung (1971). This study also suggests the bystander intervention model to explain the mechanism of international aid. The model emphasizes the importance of communication among members in a social system. It represents the processes of decision-making on a nations policy to help other countries and provides the mechanism of international communication that encourages aid. The global news media plays an important role as an agenda-setting agent. The results of multiple regression analysis reveal that global news media coverage is a significant determinant of international aid."

It has been hypothesized that Taiwans newspapers become more tabloidized when they face the severe competition from a well printed, more colorful, and celebrity-oriented newspaper.

This study content analyzed major newspapers in Taiwan to examine the size of the story, news categories (news, figure writing, special report), subjects, major actors, news source, public interest (high or low), and tabloid journalism (yes or no). The result showed that therere almost no significant differences between the contents of news in terms of major actors, subjects and news source for the three local newspapers in 2001 and 2004. The only significant differences between the news presented by these three newspapers were the public interest element of the news and tabloid journalism. The differences in news categories and contents between local newspapers and that of Apple Daily were significant."

We also obtained scores of media consumption and the degree of knowledge and interest in the Terri Schiavo case. Results show a positive effect of media consumption. Higher media consumers were significantly more likely to have engaged in an EOL decision-making conversation. Consumers of radio news were especially affected. Interest in the Terri Schiavo case was also significantly correlated with participation in an EOL conversation. While media effects literature has routinely focused on the negative aspects of media consumption (e.g., negative body image, violence), this project brings forth a positive effect by showing that heavier media consumption can lead to important and necessary conversations about sensitive topics like EOL decisions. The behavioral impact of agenda setting and the role of exemplars are discussed."

First of all, the perceptual component of the third-person effect is tested in the context of Internet pornography with U.S. college students. Second, it investigates how sexual affect influences estimates of harmful effects of Internet pornography on self and on others. Finally, two theoretical frameworks  the third-person effect approach and the affective judgmental process approach  are critically compared to find out why people support Internet pornography regulation. This study supports the perceptual component of the third-person effect. In addition, the perceptual bias does not disappear based on ones positive and negative sexual affect. However, our findings do not support the behavioral component of the third-person effect in predicting support for Internet pornography regulation. Instead, findings strongly indicate that public support for Internet pornography regulation results from peoples predisposed sexual affect."

International students from collectivistic cultures especially experience higher levels of obstacles developing friendships with U.S. American students and lower probability of smooth adjustments compared with those from individualistic cultures similar to the host culture (Olaniran, 1996). Furthermore, in the development of close relationships such as intercultural friendships, self-disclosure is the third major factor in intercultural friendship formation (Kudo & Simkin, 2003) and also a crucial and defining indicator (Matsushima & Shiomi, 2002). Hence, this study focuses on international students from China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, where cultures are predominantly high-context collectivist cultures heavily influenced by both Confucian doctrines and Buddhism (Yum, 1988; Irwin, 1996). Specifically, this paper aspires to examine and analyze self-disclosure in three levels of intercultural friendships between U.S. Americans and international students from the four Asian countries entirely from the perspectives of the international students and to discuss the results in relation to the anxiety/uncertainty management theory (Gudykunst, 1995 & 1996), and the social penetration theory (Altman & Taylor, 1973). To answer the proposed three research questions and one hypothesis, a four-page survey questionnaire was developed to assess the relationship between 11 dependent variables of self-disclosure and three levels of intercultural friendship development. In general, the findings of the present study are consistent with research on relationship development and self-disclosure."

Three hundred individuals rated equivocal and non-equivocal spokesperson responses to hypothetical scenarios describing a corporate crisis that contained either an avoidance-avoidance goal conflict or an approach-avoidance conflict. As predicted, equivocally worded spokesperson responses, rather than direct responses, were viewed as more appropriate messages to use in avoidance-avoidance goal conflict scenarios. Equivocal responses were also associated with higher levels of corporate credibility and management commitment in avoidance-avoidance goal conflict situations. At the same time, non-equivocal responses were viewed as more appropriate and associated with higher levels of corporate credibility and management commitment in approach-avoidance goal conflicts than equivocal responses."

At the micro level the researchers examined the Websites for the presence or absence of five devices identified by Gamson and Modigliani (1989) as commonly used when framing issues.
The findings suggest that activist groups are largely failing to make use of most of the suggested framing devices on their Websites. Given that this is the one mass medium that allows activist groups to inexpensively disseminate their messages to a potentially unlimited audience at the same time bypassing the filter of more traditional media, the failure to employ the full range of message framing devices is all the more troubling."

To conduct this research, two theories (theory of social construction of reality and media framing theory) and one research method (framing analysis) are used for analyzing media texts. According to findings, The New York Times and Washington Post showed a similar trend to portray North Korea. An anti-North Korea frame dominated the news coverage of North Korea in both newspapers. Furthermore, this study reveals that most news articles related to North Korea were classified into negative images instead of positive images. The U.S. newspapers framed the national image of North Korea through evil, enemy, blackmailer, and poor country images, whereas the newspapers did not used positive images such as friend when the newspapers portrayed North Korea."

Learning organization concepts, embraced by businesses throughout the 1990s are strategies for competing in dynamic, global economic environments. Worldwide, leaders across varying industries continue to strive to build learning organizations to improve effectiveness, and the ability to continuously evolve. Learning organizations depend on effective communication; a chief component of leadership influence. They also require thinking, and as many perspectives as possible in order to evolve and grow in response to external pressures. These perspectives emerge from a diversity of experiences. Thus, leaders must recognize the value of a diverse organization as an important resource in organizations ability to learn and manage change. The present analysis explores learning organization variables showing that diversity and leadership communication are important co-factors in successfully implementing learning organization principles."

This study examines how newspapers in the United States Great Britain, and India framed the disasters and their aftermath by analyzing the content of all photographs they published during the first week after the calamities hit. The most salient frames used by the three papers are lives lost, lives saved, physical, emotional and political. Results show that the American newspapers visual coverage of hurricane Katrina was more restrained compared to the way they depicted the tsunami that occurred in Asia. The British and Indian newspapers, however, covered the two disasters almost in a similar fashion, relying heavily on the physical damages and emotional frames. Examining the salient frames showed that perhaps local flavor and audience expectations influenced the selection of frames besides journalistic routines and ideology."

This study focuses on reporting by three cable news journalists, exploring their performances in comparison with established norms of detachment and objectivity, as well as routines of sourcing and newsgathering. It suggests that although the reporters were passionate and engaged, and their efforts generally well-received by news audiences, their participatory approach to on-air coverage ultimately may have been more effective as an expression of their own frustration than as a way of alleviating the suffering of others."

Employing digital duplication and production tools, global communities of network users now create and exchange media artifacts of ambiguous provenance. Their activities are blurring the boundaries between author and audience, and transforming the nature of media adaptations.
This paper examines the constellation of texts and activities that comprise Cowboy Bebop, a Japanese television program adapted to feature film, and subsequently repurposed in numerous forms. The paper asserts that three principals emerging from new media and related new audience activities are changing the constitution of media, story and genre. First, all texts are now potentially multimedia, and both commercial and communal players will increasingly exploit these properties. Second, all texts should be understood as networks of form and meaning, with a variety of constituencies contributing to both their shape and content. Third, industrial marketing strategies are supplemented, contested and extended in these new networks and activities. The role of non-commercial, textual communities in quasi-marketing activities is an important consideration in understanding contemporary media adaptation processes."

While the wounded community provides an efficient narrative device, enabling journalists to tell the story simply and quickly, it masks the complex social factors that contribute to infanticide, such as lack of adequate care for women who suffer from postpartum psychosis, gender inequalities that contribute to womens feelings of powerlessness in their homes and their workplaces, and lack of community support for mothers work as caretakers. The wounded community narrative ignores the presence of maternal ambivalence, reflects the common practice of mother-blaming, and makes women a scapegoat, creating an incomplete and often inaccurate story of the causes of maternal violence."
2006-1552,The Young and Techless? Investigating Internet Use and Problem-solving Behaviors of Youths in Singapore,Techless and Incompetent New Media Users?,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,The Young and Techless? Investigating Internet Use and Problem-solving Behaviors of Youths in Singapore,Techless and Incompetent New Media Users?,"As children of the information age, youths are often regarded and portrayed as technological experts. The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the technologically savvy image of youths by investigating the digital divide issues underlying youth Internet use, including their computer and Internet problem solving behaviors in their everyday lives. The study draws on data from a web-based questionnaire (N= 767) and face-to-face interviews (N= 38) with youths in Singapore, a country where Internet adoption is pervasive. Contrary to popular conceptualizations of youths as being a cohort of technically savvy experts, findings showed considerable variance in youths Internet expertise and problem solving behaviors. Analyses showed that socio-demographic status did not significantly affect Internet use. Instead, results showed that Internet expertise, and Internet related problem solving expertise and social support problem solving behaviors significantly influenced the online behaviors of young Internet users. Findings suggest that in wired contexts where many have already adopted the Internet, it is the variations in post-adoption patterns that may more accurately reflect the extent and presence of social stratification, extending the digital divide in the age of information."

The practice of song-sharing among romantic couples represents perhaps the most pervasive use of a popular cultural object to celebrate memories forged together. The presence of our song is widely recognized as an aspect of romantic relationships, yet the process by which a song becomes our song has not been systematically investigated. In this paper, I examine the our song phenomenon through an analysis of stories shared by informants. Among the elements examined are the relevance of content versus context in the selection of a song, whether it was sought deliberately, and the perceived functionality of song-sharing."

The third-person effects hypothesis suggests that these perceptions will be the most favorable for the self, followed by those for one's friends, and finally by those for other ""anonymous"" online social network users. Results of a pilot survey come to suppport expectations fostered by the third-person hypothesis."

This study focused on the political discussion caused by these articles in various European newspapers. It explored whether the seven Intellectuals were able to stir a political debate with pan-European perspectives, European political communication.
To obtain the empirical material, a search via Nexus-Lexus was carried out on the Internet, and follow-up calls were made to the newspapers. Results indicated a debate that was locked in regionally, presumably by cultural differences. Instead of a political dialogue across borders there were thus several regional debates, above all within the German language media.
The conclusion of the case study is that, culturally, Europe is divided into cultural and historical regions, where the three European regions suggested by Hallin and Mancini may approximate a useful division."
2006-1556,"Through a Glass Darkly: Information Monopolies, Copyright, and Academic Freedom on Campus",Copyright from the 6th Century to the 21st Century,Communication Law & Policy,,,Paper,"Through a Glass Darkly: Information Monopolies, Copyright, and Academic Freedom on Campus",Copyright from the 6th Century to the 21st Century,"ICTs are fundamentally transforming the ways in which intellectual property rights will be observed and enforced. This paper examines how legally-stipulated institutional roles to ensure individuals data privacy are increasingly in conflict with institutional obligations to pursue copyright enforcement. This raises the larger societal debate over appropriate levels of state regulation required to balance the data privacy rights of users to freely access information against the rights of owners of information and media services to realize rents. This paper predicts that a growing public awareness of threats to their individual data privacy, increasingly understood as identity theft, will compel the state to a more activist role, but at the cost of the copyright advocates who increasingly depend on technological data profiling and tracking for enforcement. Examples of how the state may in the future attempt to strike the balance between data privacy and copyright enforcement are observable today on university campuses. University students and faculty (at least some faculty!) are leading the way in shaping the digitally convergent Gigabit Society, revealing in the campus microcosm the strengths and weaknesses of existing copyright and privacy regimes. The paper uses several examples of university data policies drawn from existing law and practices to illustrate requirements for an eventual copyright regime legitimacy and implications for an emerging data social contract between owners and users of ICTs."
2006-1557,To Identify or Not to Identify: A Theoretical Model of Receiver Responses to Anonymous Communication,dentification and Anonymity on the Internet,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,To Identify or Not to Identify: A Theoretical Model of Receiver Responses to Anonymous Communication,Identification and Anonymity on the Internet,"From the founding of the U.S. Constitution to recent scandals and terrorist attacks, anonymous communication has been an issue of longstanding social import. Although anonymity has been studied for well over a century, scholarship on anonymous communication has been fragmented and the role of message receivers has been largely overlooked. A theoretical model is developed in this manuscript explaining receiver responses to anonymous communication. The context of the communication, the degree to which the source is perceived anonymous, the receivers desire to identify the source and potential ability to determine the sources identify are posited to impact attempts at identifying (or further anonymizing) the source as well as perceptions of the source, message and medium. The manuscript concludes by identifying instances where anonymity may be particularly beneficial or problematic for message receivers and offering directions for future research."
2006-1558,Too Much Good News?: News Framing of the Internet in Asian Newspapers,Old to New Media,Intercultural & Development Communication,,International & Development Communication,Paper,Too Much Good News?: News Framing of the Internet in Asian Newspapers,Old to New Media,"One of the most rapidly growing forms of innovations is the Internet, which has come to be regarded as an essential information and communication technology tool for development. But as in all types of ICT, the Internet evokes both hope and concern. Scholars have referred to these dichotomous perspectives on the Internet as utopian and dystopian. In considering the many reasons behind Asias rapid pursuit of ICT development despite existing dystopian concerns, we have to also examine the medias role in facilitating the growth and adoption of such technologies. This study investigates articles on the Asia News Network, a consortium of 13 major Asian newspapers, to determine the types of utopian and dystopian frames Asian newspapers use to report the Internet. This study also seeks to determine whether news framing of the Internet has a significant relationship with the practice of development-style journalism, a technique of reporting Asian news agencies developed to facilitate their nations development efforts. The results strongly indicate that major newspapers in Asia are more utopian than dystopian in their reporting of the Internet. Overall, articles were more utopian than dystopian about the Internet, and there were more utopian than dystopian articles. This study also finds that the quality of development news coverage of the Internet in Asian newspapers is merely moderate."

The objective was to develop a model of collaborative cognitive behavior that could be employed in the design of collaborative communication technology like the World Wide Web. The interviews were conducted with a modified TimeLine method (Dervin, 1983; Nilan, 1992) in March, 2004 and the data was content analyzed employing standard content analytic procedures. The final model developed from the data was an eight-step model of the steps perceived and expected by respondents regardless of whether they were describing a helping situation or a being helped situation. The implications of the empirical model for the design of collaborative communication technology is discussed."
2006-1560,Towards a Coevolutionary Theory of Globalization,Globalization and Communication,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Towards a Coevolutionary Theory of Globalization,Globalization and Communication,"Globalization seems to be omnipresent. Volumes have been written about it over the past few years, as scholars from many disciplines have attempted to define and account for the phenomena and processes the term describes. Most research on globalization, however, is largely a-theoretical; and even when there is an attempt to part with pure empiricism, the result is a theory on globalization, not a theory of globalization. In this paper, I argue for an evolutionary theoretical framework, which would allow for much needed theory-driven empirical analysis of global transformations. Aspects of the European Union project are used to illustrate how evolutionary theory captures change in the making. The paper concludes with a critique of this approach and outlines a research agenda that would lead to further development and resolution of current limitations."
2006-1561,Towards a Globally Interconnected Pedagogy Approach to Film Studies: Contemporary Hong Kong and Hollywood Connections,Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,Popular Communication,,,Paper,Towards a Globally Interconnected Pedagogy Approach to Film Studies: Contemporary Hong Kong and Hollywood Connections,Popular Communication Interactive Paper Session,"Though not the world's largest film producer, Hollywood has the world's biggest single marketexhibition-wise and distribution-wise. Hongkong, a major filmmaking centre no less, has had a long history of playing (to) Hollywood films, among othersa sharp contrast to the United States film market which has only until recently shown a growing willingness to program non-Hollywood films. Hongkong films have long shown a keenness to tap on literary, theatrical, filmic and other creative traditions, both within and outside; in this, Hollywood could be said to have had offered valuable lessons, in perhaps much the same way as some Hollywood filmmakers are presently learning from Hongkong. While mutual borrowing and appropriation seem to be the order of the day now, this is not without precedence. As in Hongkong, the origins of Hollywood have never been immune to external influences. Yet the notion that Hollywood has remained the main source of reference for filmmakers anywhere persists (Kolker, 1978; Aufderheide, 1998; Bordwell 2004), while non-Hollywood films, especially Asian ones, are thought or disparaged as derivatives. Through a close study of Tsui Harks Shanghai Blues (1984) with particular focus on the films intertextualities, my paper dispels that notion by showing that citations are not equivalent to imitations (in the sense of plagiarism). It relatedly suggests that the business of borrowing, appropriation and cooptation has long been integral to the filmmaking process anywherea process which would account for the diverse filmmaking traditions we see today. This is key to a globally interconnected pedagogy."
2006-1562,Towards a Phenomenological Critique of Mediated Cosmopolitanism,Global Public Discourse,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Towards a Phenomenological Critique of Mediated Cosmopolitanism,Global Public Discourse,"This paper argues that approaches to the problem of mediated cosmopolitanism, have largely not addressed many of the fundamental philosophical issues concerning the phenomenological nature of the world presented through the global media and the dialectical process of interiorization through which the global media present this world. This paper will attempt to address some of these issues, using the recent work of the German philosopher and cultural theorist Peter Sloterdijk, in particular his sphereology of globalization. Sloterdijks work, itself based on an engagement with earlier work by Benjamin, Heidegger and Bachelard, suggests that, in the formation of a world interior space, in which the global media plays an important part, far from this leading to an unambiguous expansion of horizons of the individual, as the claims of mediated cosmopolitanism would lead us to expect, an opposite process is observable, in which the formation of the world interior leads to the disappearance of the exterior and to a process of immunization of the media consumer against this exterior, a process which, in its phenomenological nature, is often opposite in its import to the expansion of horizons implicit in cosmopolitanism."
2006-1563,Towards a Theory of Visual Narrative Analysis: What We See on HGTV,Theory Development for Visual Analysis,Visual Studies,,,Paper,Towards a Theory of Visual Narrative Analysis: What We See on HGTV,Theory Development for Visual Analysis,"A rhetorical analysis of the reality-genre network Home and Garden Television (HGTV) attempts to determine whether Fisher's Narrative Paradigm Theory (NPT) can be applied to visual representations to reveal implicit stories and values. HGTV's controlled production, niche focus, and seemingly formulaic plots raise important issues concerning the conceptualization of narrative in lifestyle TV. This study asks what stories are told and how these stories perform persuasively. Findings indicate the shows can be interpreted by associating NPT's concept of narrative probability to the literal content of images, and its concept of narrative fidelity to the descriptive form of images. Results conclude that both moralistic and materialistic myths of the American Dream are present in the pictorial syntax of the programs; that pictorial syntax helps to construct metaphoric propositions through descriptive spatial and temporal form within and between frames; and that form suggests and reinforces figurative imagery. These findings have implications for the use of NPT in televisual analysis to reveal latent values as subtext in our culture's dominant communication medium."
2006-1564,Towards the Measurement of Psychological Health Empowerment in the General Public,Advances in Health Communication Theory and Conceptualization,Health Communication,,,Paper,Towards the Measurement of Psychological Health Empowerment in the General Public,Advances in Health Communication Theory and Conceptualization,"Background: health empowerment is considered to be one of the key elements in the current transformation towards a health care consumer model and the emergence of the post modern expert patient. Hypothesis testing in quantitative health empowerment research, however, has been hindered by the lack of a standardized measurement instrument for the empirical assessment of the empowerment construct.
Method: In this paper, two theoretical models on psychological empowerment are translated into a likert-type measurement instrument. Five focus group interviews (n=31) were administered for item construction and self administered questionnaires in two different samples were used for items analysis and scale construction (sample1: n=330; sample2: n=213).
Results: two 15-item likert-type scales for psychological health empowerment were constructed using exploratory factor analysis. The results supported for the three faceted (G-HES3) as well as the four faceted theoretical model (G-HES4). Second order confirmatory factor analysis, however, suggested that the model reflecting the G-HES3 was more parsimonious than the G-HES4 model. Additionally, initial support for the criterion validity of the G-HES3 was provided.
Conclusion: Both the three facetted and the four facetted theoretical model on psychological health empowerment can be translated into a likert-type measurement instrument. It is, however, suggested that the costs associated with the addition of a fourth factor to the construct of psychological health empowerment are not sufficiently compensated by an increase in model fit. The G-HES3 three is therefore suggested as the better alternative for the measurement of psychological health empowerment in quantitative research."

In particular, this paper examines an event which took place in April, 2005, where three citizens were excluded from a Social Security town-hall meeting because the vehicle they arrived in exhibited a bumper sticker critical of Bush administration policies. The key question examined is whether private individuals who volunteered at the event can be considered state actors thereby implicating the citizens First Amendment rights. The issue is highly relevant, especially in America, given the increasing importance and power in our society of private institutions and individuals and given that such private persons are generally not constrained by the Constitution. The paper also provides a good launching pad through which to discuss other countries treatment of freedom of expression and the differences between the First Amendment and its counterparts or lack thereof in other societies."

German participants (n = 206) read a short mystery story, divided into four segments, and indicated suspicions and text liking during exposure. The story varied in a 2 x 2 x 2 design, as each of the first three segments contained clues hinting toward either suspect A or B. Thus mystery complexity was varied through timing and congruity of presented clues. After reading the mystery resolution with suspect A as culprit, respondents reported emotional responses and overall enjoyment before completing the need-for-cognition scale. Findings show that participants with low need-for-cognition tended to like the mystery with very low or moderately low complexity more, while participants with high need-for-cognition liked the moderately high complexity best. Very high complexity was generally disliked. High certainty about the culprit, curiosity, and surprise were significant predictors of mystery enjoyment."

First, we must historicize WSIS in relation to an earlier UN-sponsored summit, the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO), which was similarly focused on global communications policy. Second, we must theorize WSIS in terms related to the dominant political economic system defining global relations today: neoliberalism. Neoliberalisms ascendance coinciding with NWICOs demise is not random coincidence. Tackling these two projects will help bring into focus both continuities and changes over the previous three decades. This time period is a crucial chapter in the development of our current global communication system."

A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on data from college students (N=1,528) in three societies of the Greater China area, who responded to the 40-item Chinese value survey (CVS). The proposed final measurement model contains five factors and obtains adequate model fit on several estimation measures. The resulting oblique dimensions are labeled Work ethics, Moral virtues, Temperament, Human Relations, and Social Prestige. The first fours factors are conceptually associated with four of Kluckhohn & Strobecks universal human problems of Relation with Nature, Human nature, Personality/activity, and Human relations and appear to represent traditional Chinese solutions to these problems, i.e., traditional Chinese value orientations. The last factor Social prestige represents a value orientation probably unique to this culture."

The first is a simply a close and comparative reading of four key cybernetic texts on both sides of the Atlantic from 1948 to 1955: two American (Norbert Wieners Cybernetics (1948) and The Human Use of Human Beings (1950)) as well as two Soviet (Sergei Sobolev, Anatolii Kitov, and Aleksei Liapunovs The Main Features of Cybernetics and Ernest Kolmans What is Cybernetics? (1955)). The close reading of texts in two languages offers at once an introduction and a reexamination of the foundations of first-order cybernetics as an interdisciplinary and international science.

The second contribution made is an attempt to develop and revisit a historical irony: cybernetics emerged as a subtle and often sublimated cry for peace-oriented collaboration across, and largely thanks to, the academic internecine aggression across the Atlantic. Cybernetics, as initially envisioned by Wiener, remains an irreducibly cross-cultural artifactone whose call for international translation, cooperation, and an ultimate peace may stand worthwhile revisitation in Wieners time as well as in our own.

Especially appropriate to note for conference-goers in Dresden, this paper loosely details in its footnotes some of the explicitly European social, cultural, and literary projects that preceded cybernetic thought."

Norwegian media in particular followed the election with great interest. In the eyes of Norwegian media, the election held significant ramifications for world issues such as the war in Iraq and the war on terror. Further, the strong social and familial bonds between Norwegians and Americans was a foundation for an interest in the role that social issues such as abortion, gay marriage, and religion played in the campaign. This paper is a case study based on data from 2004 U.S. Presidential election coverage in Norwegian newspapers. The paper examines the way in which Norwegian newspapers framed the U.S. Presidential election. Framing theory was utilized as the tool for conducting a content analysis of newspaper coverage. Results are presented and implications for the role of framing theory in international contexts are discussed."

Japanese organizations traditionally have a strong relationship with their employees, and this psychological or mental connection between an organization and employees are recognized as organizational identity. In this paper, transformation of corporate identity is discussed in terms of critical perspective. A Japanese case of the cover-up scandal by Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (MMC) is analyzed, and three aspects of organizational deception are confirmed: offensive, defensive, and collaborative deceptions. There are a couple of important findings. (1) Strong identification with an organization is reified into a corporate brand through ingroup communication. (2) Symbolic process of discourse and knowledge creation discipline MMC workers in concertive control. (3) In corporate hegemony, top management does not directly commit the crime, but collective will made the organizational members to naturally commit misdeeds. (4) Organizational identity is transformed into idolatry, and their organizational communication becomes fetish in corporate hegemony. I conclude that corporate misconduct is neither errors nor mistakes in management but it is a natural consequence of the current management systems, and a center of a corporate misconduct must be considered as transformation of organizational identification and reification of communication"
2006-1573,Translocal Media Cultures: Networks of the Media and Globalisation,Technologies and Network Cultures,Philosophy of Communication,,,Paper,Translocal Media Cultures: Networks of the Media and Globalisation,Technologies and Network Cultures,"Focusing on media theory and globalisation steers us to a tricky situation: on the one hand theory is the thing in academy which travels best globally. But when discussing media theory in the time of globalisation we have to realise  on the other hand  that theory is not something universal. In this situation one should be careful when arguing that connectivity, network and flow are appropriate concepts for media and cultural studies in the time of globalisation in general. If we accept the general critique of post-structuralism and deconstructionism, it is impossible to develop that universal theory of media and cultural globalisation. Nevertheless I would like to pick up the argument that connectivity, network and flow are theoretical concepts which help us to develop a way of theoretical thinking, which is especially appropriate for media and cultural studies focusing on questions of globalisation. With these concepts it becomes possible to theorise media cultures in the time of globalisation, not because they are universal but because they allow a self-reflexive way of thinking which is highly productive in questioning a western-centric point of view. To clarify this approach, I want to propose a two step argument: first I want to give based on own empirical research some comments on the concepts of (global) connectivity, networks and flows. Secondly, taking these reflections as a starting point I want to develop a theorisation of translocal media cultures."

The paper applied an integrated management perspective to organizational crisis research. Three representative PR crisis cases involving KFC, Haagen-Dazs and Nestle were reported and accessed specifically. Following Pearson and Clairs crisis management model and looking at the degree to which the perspectives used to study crisis communication in Western cultures are predicative of audience perceptions in a non-Western culture, a tentative conclusion was drawn that the Western frameworks are generalizable. This study reported several findings that suggest cross-cultural variation in crisis communication. We found three Chinese distinctive cultural factors influential to the success of crisis communication in China consisting the importance of Ren Qing revealed by appropriate attitudes, position and wording, preference to no comment and practical compensation rather than minimization and apology, which is different from the Western society. Also, the other factor relevant to the rapid social change was draw such as the media has high level of public credibility particularly in the context of negative information although it may sometimes arouse mass compliance. Also, the concept of Guanxi was clarified for the sake of the applicability of personal influence model. The practical and theoretical implications for international crisis communication were suggested."

The indications that trust is breaking down, as noted by a number of researchers, is a matter of grave concern. An environment in which others words are constantly questioned and judged diminishes the role of agency and has an impact on interpersonal relationships. Research presented here compares high-trust and low-trust organizational contexts with an aim to elucidate the role of trust in developing and maintaining interpersonal relationships in organizations. In the introductory section of the paper, I address the role of trust in human relationships and organizations in general. In the following section, I explain the purpose of the study and the method applied. In the third section, I present the findings from the study, with a specific focus on implications of low-trust organizational contexts. In the final section, I provide a discussion of the findings."

Previous researches have examined the linkage between Internet use and interpersonal trust as an indicator of social capital. The present study investigated into the relationship between Internet use and trust by expanding and dissecting the concept of trust into three different categories: interpersonal, media and social system. Data for analysis were obtained from an annual telephone survey of a random sample of 1,687 Macao residents in 2003. Major research findings showed that online news browsing was negatively associated with both social system and media trust marginally while forum participation has a significant negative predictor for social system trust. However, it is found that interpersonal trust was not significantly related to any forms of Internet use. Results and implications were discussed with an emphasis on both the special cultural-political system of this study and the international comparison."

The individual or group is often ostracized or chastised for their difference. In severe cases, intolerance among the norm has escalated to violence against the deviant, even death. Most people do not witness this intentional death firsthand, however, but experience it through media representations. Therefore, television and film play a crucial role in teaching people what behavior is deviant and thus, results in death (Goodwin and Bronfen, 1993).
Little research has focused on the victims role in crime. Most studies focus on crime patterns or violence and cultivation in television viewing (Dominick, 1973; Soulliere, 2003; Gerbner & Gross, 1976). It is important to look beyond crime patterns and audience effects into the specific representations appearing on television. These depictions likely shape and reinforce public perception of deviance and suggest victim culpability due to personal characteristics.
This research examines homicide victim representations, exploring what traits and behavior is possibly linked to death in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Findings indicate that victim typologies exist, suggesting that traits such as physical difference and race, along with particular lifestyles, result in ones murder. These results are significant because they reinforce early theories of victimology, implying that a person contributes to his/her victimization by embodying certain characteristics or lifestylesa notion generally rejected by contemporary scholars. This is alarming because these representations identify certain qualities as deviant, thereby reinforcing intolerance and justifying victimization of these groups."
2006-1580,Two Approaches to Emotional Reactions Toward Media Messages: Appraisal and Message Sensation Value,Understanding the Role of Emotion in Processing Media,Information Systems,,,Paper,Two Approaches to Emotional Reactions Toward Media Messages: Appraisal and Message Sensation Value,Understanding the Role of Emotion in Processing Media,"The subjective labeling of discrete emotion and emotional arousal represent two alternative routes to understanding the emotion formation process. The current study takes both components into account and addresses the issue of how to construct media messages to elicit certain emotions to make them more persuasive. Appraisal theory is used to represent the first route to emotion. It explains how cognitive interpretation of the event features or message content leads to discrete emotions. Message sensation value (MSV), a set of message structural features supposed to elicit higher arousal, is used to represent the second route to emotion. The impacts of both variables are examined in the context of AIDs and anti-violence public service announcements. Using a 2 (2ad sets) *2 (2 presentation orders)* 3(3 ad valence) mixed design, this study in general replicates the links between appraisal processes and corresponding emotions in the mediated context, suggesting the possibility of using appraisal mechanisms to create emotional messages. There is also some evidence that MSV may moderate the impact of appraisal on emotions, such that high MSV ads may restrict whereas low MSV ads may improve the secondary appraisal processes. Several negative discrete emotions are found to be more persuasive than other emotions. Implications for message design as well as limitations and future directions are discussed."
2006-1581,Two Metaphors of Intercultural Communication,Methodological Issues in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural & Development Communication,,Intercultural Communication,Works in Progress,Two Metaphors of Intercultural Communication,Methodological Issues in Intercultural Communication,"Insider and outsider are two metaphors of intercultural communication and have rich historical and social significance. This paper analyzes the two metaphors in light of three conceptual paradoxes: (1) international communication vs. global communication; (2) modernity vs. postmodernity; and (3) self-reference vs. fusion of horizons. While the first paradox illustrates the social and historical root of the distinction between the insider and the outsider, the second paradox inquires into the philosophical and political foundation of the distinction, and the third paradox focuses on the cognitive and strategic character of the distinction. This paper argues that the insider and the outsider are a dichotomy derived from a West-centered discourse; to break down any sort of ethnocentrism, to promote productive cross-cultural communication, and to build a harmonious global village, we shall create dialectic combinations of integration and differentiation, modernity and postmodernity, occidentism and orientalism, and globalism and localism."
2006-1582,"Understanding Leisure Consumption Through Modeling Processes That Underlie TV Viewing, Internet Use, and Retail Shopping",Media Use: The Latest Research,Mass Communication,,,Paper,"Understanding Leisure Consumption Through Modeling Processes That Underlie TV Viewing, Internet Use, and Retail Shopping",Media Use: The Latest Research,"The present study was an attempt to integrate diverse research on leisure motives and present a unifying understanding of processes that underlie television viewing, internet use, and retail shopping. The uses and gratifications paradigm provided theoretical explanations. Two consistent strategies of leisure consumption  instrumental (or cognitive) and ritualized (or affective)  were suggested. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate any direct, indirect, or non-recursive effects of leisure consumption strategies on consumption, satisfaction, and addiction. Gender, self-esteem, need for cognition, alienation, and aggressiveness were also included in the models.
664 undergraduate students filled out an online questionnaire. CFAs supported presence of the two consistent leisure strategies. The instrumental strategy included learning, dreaming, socializing, and cognitive processing dimensions. The ritualized strategy included entertainment, pass time, and affective processing dimensions.
Consistent Findings: Both satisfaction and addiction predicted general leisure consumption. The ritualized strategy increased leisure satisfaction and the instrumental strategy increased leisure addiction. Female gender increased use of the ritualized strategy, whereas alienation decreased it. Need for cognition and aggressiveness increased use of the instrumental strategy, whereas self-esteem decreased it. Overall, high self-esteem served as a buffer against addiction and increased satisfaction. Aggressiveness increased leisure behaviors, either through addictions or direct use. Theoretical implications are discussed."
2006-1583,Understanding Media Use as a Process: A Media Sequencing Model Linking Influences and Communication Tasks,Theories of Communication Technology Use,Communication and Technology,,,Paper,Understanding Media Use as a Process: A Media Sequencing Model Linking Influences and Communication Tasks,Theories of Communication Technology Use,"This paper argues that much of our past research on media use has assumed that people use only one medium per task. Here, I propose that we view media use as a process; one that is informed by existing media use theories and by interdisciplinary work that links media sequencing and communication tasks. In the first section of this paper, I integrate existing media use literature into a model that describes (a) media use influences and (b) communication tasks. Next, I review a broad literature that speaks to a more process-oriented view of media use. Specifically I elaborate on six theoretical perspectives that explain and demonstrate communicative reasons to use media in sequences. These relationships form the basis for a series of 13 propositions that establish how we might further test and understand media use sequencing. These include theoretically derived influencesi.e., media traits, social influences, job role, and managerial statusthat affect sequential media use. There are also links between specific types of communication taskse.g., documentation and informationand the increased likelihood that media sequences are used. A comparison table between the communication tasks and the theories informing their use, uncovers the final proposition that sequential media use is more helpful for information and persuasion tasks than for social and person tasks."

Many researchers have pointed out that business news coverage is important to organizations attempting to manage issues because much of what consumers and other external stakeholders learn about companies and the issues that surround them comes form the news media. Therefore, the present study explored the influence of public relations measured as the amount of news coverage on corporate reputation and the bottom-line. This study supports the understanding of the impact of news coverage on corporate reputations revenues."

Consuming the B vitamin folic acid can reduce the incidence of NTDs 50-70%, and recent efforts to reduce NTD rates have focused on increasing the number of childbearing aged women who take a vitamin containing folic acid every day. To this end, two exploratory, qualitative studies were conducted in order to (a) understand the complexity of vitamin use among women in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and (b) serve as a foundation on which to develop national communication and education interventions. Results indicated that campaign messages designed to increase folic acid use through multivitamin supplementation in the U.S. must address womens barriers to vitamin use (e.g., cost, time), increase womens perceived need for multivitamins (e.g., identify immediate, tangible results from taking a daily multivitamin), and address the relationship between daily food choices and the need for supplementation. Future campaign messages in Puerto Rico must focus on many of these same issues, in addition to increasing womens knowledge about when folic acid should be taken in relation to pregnancy and addressing womens perceptions that vitamins cause weight gain (an undesirable outcome for most participants). The practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed."
2006-1586,Understanding the Interactive Effects of Message Production Features and Claim Effectiveness in Health Messages,Message Strategies: Emotional Appeals and Sensation Value,Health Communication,,,Paper,Understanding the Interactive Effects of Message Production Features and Claim Effectiveness in Health Messages,Message Strategies: Emotional Appeals and Sensation Value,"This paper examines the independent effects of the effectiveness of specific claims made in PSAs and the emotional appeal used in the PSAs on overall ratings of message effectiveness. The results show that specific claim effectiveness matters. PSAs containing highly effective claims are rated as more effective than those with less effective claims regardless of emotional appeal. On the other hand, there is an interaction of emotional appeal and claim effectiveness which shows that arousing messages (either positive or negative) which have weak or ineffective claims are always rated as less attention getting, less persuasive, less helpful to self, and less helpful to others. It is suggested that this combination of arousing production with weak claims may be partially responsible for boomerang effects seen in testing of recent drug prevention campaigns."

Although a number of studies have investigated the factors that promote testing, we are not aware of any study that focuses on the underlying attributes of voluntary HIV testing behavior. Using an ecological perspective, in the first part of this paper, we sought to determine important attributes that define three components of the underlying behavior: not getting tested and not motivated to do so; not getting tested but motivated to do so; and getting tested. Through discriminant analysis techniques, we investigated factors at three levels of analysis  structural, interpersonal, and individual  that differentiate the three groups. In the second part, we used testing status to predict behavioral intentions after controlling for prior high-risk behaviors. Data for this study (N = 3,100) come from the baseline assessment of our ongoing intervention in Namibia as part of the United States Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program. Findings indicate important differences among the three groups. The untested and unmotivated group appears to be particularly susceptible to both structural and individual-level deficiencies. Implications for public health campaigns are also discussed."

We manipulated vulnerability to a health risk (Repetitive Strain Injury; low vs. high) and self-affirmation status (non-affirmed vs. self-affirmed). The dependent variables were cognitive responses, attitudes, and intentions to adopt a recommended solution to the health risk. The results supported our hypothesis. Under conditions of high vulnerability, self-affirmed participants were less persuaded by the action recommendation than non-affirmed participants. Self-affirmation had no effects under conditions of low vulnerability. These findings suggest that individuals who feel vulnerable to a health risk may accept action recommendations because they are motivated to restore their self-image that was threatened by the fear appeal."

Recently, a series of studies have proposed an integrative theory with critical predictors of behavior, based on the most common behavior change theories. Because of the salient effectiveness of communication campaigns, campaigners need to understand what factors lead individuals to have an interest in the campaigns. The purpose of this study was to explore crucial predictors within the integrative theory and apply them to an actual communication campaign for preventing violence on campus. Results showed that college students attitude and perceived norms significantly predicted intentions to attend the campaigns, with attitude having more salient influence on intentions. However, self-efficacy did not significantly predict the intentions. Ultimately, the study offers more effective understanding of better messages and stronger strategies for making violence prevention campaigns on campus more successful."

Visuals have the potential to have a faster processing and reaction time than other modes of communication. While visual communication and graphics have been researched extensively, there hasnt been a lot of focus on how visuals affect the persuasion process. Visuals rarely stand alone in persuasion processes, as they do not necessarily have the ability to persuade on their own, but rather serve as a supportive function to other persuasive techniques. This review of visual persuasion from a historical analysis/ literature review seeks to define the role visuals have in the persuasion process, particularly in cognitive and affective processing, and indicate areas where further research is necessary."
2006-1605,Unpacking Television Entertainment Through Experience Sampling: A Multilevel Analysis,formation Systems Interactive Paper Session,Information Systems,,,Paper,Unpacking Television Entertainment Through Experience Sampling: A Multilevel Analysis,Information Systems Interactive Paper Session,"Handheld computers were used to capture ecological momentary assessments of perceived entertainment from television over the course of a week. Key constructs from uses and gratifications, mood, character identification and presence were tested using multilevel analysis of the experience records. Constructs from all four theory areas explained entertainment ratings obtained during television viewing experiences. Entertainment was found to be contingent on the motives one brings to the entertainment experience, the extent to which one identifies with the characters in the plot, and perceptions of transportation and immersion in the media experience. In support of mood management theory, entertainment provided by television programs was rated higher when participants reported less pleasant mood states. However, the effect of mood was not as strong as the effect of presence, which emerged as the strongest predictor of entertainment."

The present three phase study seeks whether those efforts have been successful.
A pilot study examines tobacco image frequency in seconds during films before and after the MSA, as well as number of tobacco instances per film. The second phase further developed this methodology, and consisted of analyzing all youth-oriented films (G, PG, and PG-13 ratings) garnering spots within the top ten theatre grossing films within their debut year, distributed before and after the MSA. Results suggest a clear decrease in tobacco images within youth-oriented films. A final phase focuses on 276 younger adult film viewers impressions of tobacco use through distributed surveys, regarding films and their potential tobacco use impact on viewers. Suggestions for further policy development and research are provided."

These advancements, epitomized by the Internet, greatly increase the speed and efficiency of transactions and catalyze productivity and economic growth. The architecture of the Internet separates content from ownership on the network and allows for application and service providers to lie beyond the jurisdiction of national rules and regulations (Bach 2001). While characteristics of the Internet appear to make this technology borderless, our geo-political global makeup, the backbone of the law, remains delineated in terms of sovereign nations. These nations follow vastly different approaches in their attempt to regulate the Internet and the digital economy. Thus, while the Internet can be viewed as a global network, national governments have different standards for the treatment of personal information and identifiers.
This essay first explores the cross-border variation in privacy protection in the United States and European Union, and discusses major regulatory initiatives implemented by both regions, including the EU Data Directive and the US Patriot Act. Theoretical analysis of privacy protection is offered to explain the considerable variation between the different regimes. An examination of the regulatory spillover in the travel industry with regard to passenger information concludes the practical analysis of this paper."

Identifying and understanding some of the influences on user adoption and technological competence may allow for potential intervention into the phenomenon of technophobia. This study investigated a number of factors associated with the use and adoption of new technology, with emphasis on communication technologies. User adoption was examined in relation to competence, to include the factors of motivation, knowledge, and skill. Some concerns associated with learning new technologies were addressed, such as technophobia, diffusion, and the effects of exposure to associated technical jargon. In addition, the influence of a persons social network was addressed, considering whether they may be supportive and helpful in reducing technophobia and increasing competence. Through this study the development of new perspectives on the societal impact of emerging technologies was explored and tested. This study distributed both hardcopy and online surveys to a sample of over 250 community members. The results showed that as motivation, knowledge, skills, and network supportiveness increase, technophobia decreases, and as these processes occur, likelihood of technology adoption increases. In addition, the study found that the effects of exposure to technical jargon on technophobia were moderated by gender and the particular aspects of competence and motivation being studied."

The findings suggest that even when there is a high user satisfaction with a health information Web site, there are significant perceptual differences between a consumers perception of a health Web site and his/her interests in using it. Three statistically significant factors, or perceptual orientations, towards GHR were identified. One factor assesses GHR for its overall design, appeal and perceived personality characteristics. A second factor evaluates GHR based on the Web sites perceived source credibility and quality of information. A third factor assesses GHR more according to its perceived complexity/simplicity and the sites perceived bias. The study demonstrates that profiling the users of a health information Web site by evaluating its image helps unveil the personality that a Web site communicates to users."

The researcher conducted a Web survey in January 2005 on two popular non-journalists political blogs  InstaPundit and Power Line. More than 8,950 readers of the two blogs responded to the survey. Most respondents are habitual blog users. Cognitive motivations are the strongest motivation to read the two blogs, followed by affective motivations and personal identity motivations. Respondents read the duo for both opinions and news. The most attractive attributes of blog opinions include being enlightening and informative, and those of blog news include being often updated and with hyperlinks. Motivations are not strong predictors in habitual blog use. Future research can explore reasons related to media and social-cultural systems to explain habitual blog use."

Data Mining the John Kerry Candidate Blog for Networked Community Structure Dynamics,Political Uses of the Internet,"This study applies World Wide Web network theory to an examination of the community structure of the 2004 US democratic presidential candidates blog, JohnKerry.com. Using data mining methodologies to conduct a longitudinal assessment of the 397,822 blog comments from the blogs inception in August 8, 2003, to its closing in November 4, 2004, this study answers lingering questions on the extent of usage of the candidate blog by its 15,742 distinct users. Strong similarities between candidate blog networks and preexisting World Wide Web networks are present in the findings of growth, preferential attachment, power laws, and burstiness in the period under examination. The top 10 percent of users were responsible for 61 to 85 percent of comments on the blog. The blog grew as predicted over time, bolstered by early users who buttressed the blog through low points to its final days. Burstiness in comment activity during real-world campaign events highlighted the blog as a virtual public sphere that extended offline discussion. Locating candidate blog networks within predictable structures and well-defined organizing principles of preexisting network theory, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding the blog networks as interpersonal communication devices amidst the increasing adoption of blogs by current US political candidates."
2006-1612,Using Communication to Bridge the Divide Between Teleworking and Office-Based Employees Work Experiences,tructuring Communication Technologies,Organizational Communication,,,Works in Progress,Using Communication to Bridge the Divide Between Teleworking and Office-Based Employees Work Experiences,Structuring Communication Technologies,"Telework, or working from home or a satellite location via technological connections, has become increasingly popular in today's organizations. But despite the changes technology has spurred in organizational structures and communication, little is known about the communication patterns and organizational norms that allow teleworking employees to compensate for their lack of face-to-face interaction and maintain similar work experiences as their office-based colleagues. Face-to-face interactions may benefit office-based employees through increased information exchange, work group cohesiveness, and quality leader-member exchange. But the office environment also enables negative experiences such as interruptions and distractions, and political and social undermining behaviors. This study compares how teleworking and office-based employees experience these aspects of the workplace. Based on social information processing theory (Walther, 1992) and social presence theory (Short, Williams, & Christie, 1976), this study seeks to identify the communication media, norms, and contextual factors that increase the sense of physical presence, salience, and connectedness in teleworkers communication with colleagues. Teleworkers able to achieve this sense of connection through their communication are predicted to experience the aforementioned aspects of work in a way comparable to their office-based colleagues. The constructs of social presence and sociability are extended beyond static attributes of communication media to represent attributes of teleworkers communication as enabled by the technology, communication norms, social processes, patterns, and practices in their work environment and telework arrangement. This study is important in that it extends social presence theory, and begins to fill the void of field studies examining teleworking employees work experiences."

The Internet has brought increased access for and to children as a media audience. Yet computer filtering systems have proven inadequate (Miller, 2001); parents admit they cannot and do not monitor their children 24-hours-a-day (Hertzel, 2000); and many juveniles today are technologically more literate than their adult counterparts (Austin & Reed, 1999). This is occurring while United States courts have chosen not to technologically censor Internet content entering the country (Flanagin, Maynard, Farinola & Metzger, 2000). Therefore, in many cases protection for children in the U.S. seems to have fallen through the cracks. Nineteenth century sociologist Emile Durkheims social control theory contends that without any standards or regulations, the human tendency for the public is to act in its own individual interests (Gibbons & Jones, 1975), not necessarily childrens. This study, therefore, will address concerns parents might have regarding childrens use of the Internet, whether court cases indicate increased use of the Internet for child pornography purposes, and any behavior that has been taken by the government to protect children."

In recent years, the use of online support groups has become a popular source of additional social support outside of immediate family and friends. However, the electronic environment prohibits warm hugs, smiles, and other components of traditionally supportive behavior. Therefore, it is important to know whether the verbal exchange that constitutes an online support group can provide effective social support. A previous line of research has shown that highly person-centered messages, which explicitly elaborate, acknowledge, and legitimize the feelings of distressed individuals, are perceived as more supportive, helpful, caring, and appropriate by support recipients in a variety of contexts. The present study examines whether messages ranked as high in person-centeredness are also rated as highly effective by the target population. A sample of 431 women over the age of 40, of whom 221 report ever having had a medical diagnosis of breast cancer, read and evaluated a body of 27 messages taken from an online support group for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. Results indicate that person-centered hierarchy is a significant predictor of perceived message effectiveness."

A comparative study was conducted on analyzing the contents of 230 web automobile advertisements from the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and the United States of America (USA) in terms of the use of utilitarian appeals and symbolic appeals. Results indicate that utilitarian appeals are dominant in both the advertisements from the PRC and USA. However, symbolic appeals are used significantly more in the advertisements from the PRC while utilitarian appeals are employed more frequently in the advertisements from the USA. Examination of the results reveals that culture (culture of consumption) and product category (level of product involvement, product nature and product type) serve as two important factors explaining the cross-national similarities and differences on the use of value appeals in Internet advertisements."

This paper examines the Selectivity Hypothesis with respect to male and female responses to CRM within the United States. Study 1 showed that women are more likely to purchase products from companies that support charitable causes than men are. However, these sex differences were explained by variations in world-view (caring) values. Caring fully mediated the influence of sex on response to CRM. Study 2 examined gendered responses to a CRM message in an experiment. Study 1 results were replicated, although caring only partially mediated the influence of sex on message response. When attitude toward the cause and perceived congruency between cause and company were taken into consideration, sex differences disappeared. Further, when purchase intentions of the featured CRM product were examined over time, womens purchase intentions decreased, but mens increased. Theoretical and managerial aspects of sex and values as segmentation variables in public relations practices are discussed."

A survey was implemented to examine three sets of hypotheses and three research questions on various linkages. The results indicated that the relationships among the support for postmaterialist priorities, political environments, and economic conditions were not significant. Nonetheless, in contrast to the statistically significant correlation between the support for materialistic values and the usage of entertainment media, the postmaterialist value support was positively correlated with public affairs media use. Also, positive correlations were found between the use of public affairs media and public affairs knowledge, reflective integration, and political participation. On the other hand, postmaterialist value supporters demonstrated a higher frequency of political participation than their materialist counterparts, but again political and economic conditions were found insignificantly related to the frequency of political participation. The finding of the relations among value systems, media uses, and political participation help enlighten the understanding of functions and political consequences by these various linkages in different national and cultural contexts. The pursuit in this line of investigation would also benefit from survey sampling covering a wider range of demographic groups as well as societies."

Utilizing qualitative data from focus groups and quantitative data from a survey, this study first develops a theoretical model of nonprofit volunteer participation and satisfaction then tests this model through structural equation modeling. The data derive from over 250 volunteers of a nonprofit organization located in a large southwestern urban area. Specifically, this study investigates the relationship of volunteer motivation, organizational communication, and structural barriers with job satisfaction, intent to remain with the organization, and intent to engage in volunteer initiated recruitment. A slightly modified model derived from the theorized model received support. Motivation predicted satisfaction with organizational communication, which in turn predicted perceived barriers, job satisfaction, commitment, and intentions to recruit others. Implications are examined both for the theory of organizational communication and the recruitment of volunteers for nonprofit organizations."

This term indicates that gender identities and gender discourse are constructed out of the language, practices and behaviours of daily life. In this paper we explore the meaning of videogames as technologies of gender. Videogames and videogameculture are generally seen as being connected to masculine preferences and we are interested in finding out what this means for both male and female gamers. We have looked at discussions on online forums concerning the RPG Final Fantasy X-2 and made a qualitative analysis of postings that contained some sort of gender-performance. We found that Final Fantasy X-2 can be a starting point for discussions about the meaning gamers attribute to male and female gender performances. They discuss the ways boys and girls should look, how they should dress and how they should behave, and we therefore conclude that videogames can indeed function as technologies of gender. Also, at least on the forums concerning this particular game-title, we found that the issue of male dominance is no longer as strict as in other fields of videogameculture."

In a similar vein, the study reported here examines Bill OReillys employing of propaganda devices in the Talking Points section of his cable show. In a content analysis of 80 commentaries the use of the seven devices, fear frames, and OReillys characterization of people or ideas as victims, villainous, or virtuous were documented. Not only did OReilly use propaganda devices substantially more often than Coughlin, but he was also less nuanced in his use of the devices. He used name calling more than twice as often as any other device. Moreover, almost half the commentaries were grounded in a fear frame, and specific people or ideas consistently emerged in the roles of victims, villains, or part of the virtuous."

Results indicate that frequency of video game play was not related to moral disengagement, but player interpretations of the violence in video games predicted scores on the composite moral disengagement scale and on the subscales of dehumanization of victims and euphemistic labeling. Specifically, players perceptions of the games as more serious, but less graphic, and players identification with the games characters predicted stronger tendencies to disengage self-sanctions against detrimental behavior."
2006-1623,Virtual Team Leaders as Rhetoricians of Identification,dentification Processes in Organizational Networks,Organizational Communication,,,Paper,Virtual Team Leaders as Rhetoricians of Identification,Identification Processes in Organizational Networks,"The number of virtual teams is increasing in todays workplaces. Virtual team members often work in various countries and are professionals in their own fields. As such diverse and dispersed teams communicate mainly through communication technology this raises the challenge for the team leader of how to get the members to identify themselves with the team. This qualitative study focuses on four Finnish virtual team leaders and their tactics for strengthening the members identification through computer-mediated communication. The findings are congruent with the tactics of rhetorical identification found in Cheneys (1983) study: expression of concern for the individual, recognition of individual contributions, espousal of shared values, advocacy of company benefits and activities and the use of praise from outsiders. In addition, two new factors relating to identification with the team were found: technology and organizational change. The roles of these factors in identification with virtual teams are also discussed."

The nature of the Internet - the ease of access, the chaotic structure, the anonymity, the liberal spirit, and the international character - all furnish terrorist organizations with a new, easy and effective arena for action. However, counter-terrorism measures, especially those introduced after the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, raise serious concerns about restricting free expression and free flow of information. This paper focuses on this new battle, examining both the uses of the Internet by modern terrorist organizations and the costs of the attempts to prevent them. How do modern terrorists use the Internet and for what purposes? How can governments respond to this new challenge? This paper reports the findings of a seven-year monitoring of over 5,000 terrorist sites using a qualitative content analysis to learn about rhetorical structures, symbols, persuasive appeals, target audiences, interactivity and communication tactics. Finally, the study will examine various implications for policy making regarding terrorism and the Internet, especially with regard to its accessibility, boundaries on freedom of speech and usability for the spread of hate and violence."

The purpose of the experiment was to test two competing theories about banner animation effects: distinctiveness theory and motion effect theory. All participants (N = 31) in a 2 (Animation) x 2 (Banner Type) x 4 (Number of Animated Distractors) within-subjects factorial experiment were participated in a Web banner search task. Each subject completed a total of 72 trials. In each trial, the subject was shown a target banner and asked to search the target in the mist of distractors that were arrayed in a subsequent display. In the half of conditions, the targets were animated while in the other half of the conditions, the targets were present static. Results of the search time showed no main effects for animation and distractor numbers supporting the motion effect theory. Both theoretical and practical implications of the key findings were discussed."
2006-1626,Visual Hybrids: Mapping the Terrain of Popular Factual Television,Boundaries and Transgressions in Visual Discourse,Visual Studies,,,Paper,Visual Hybrids: Mapping the Terrain of Popular Factual Television,Boundaries and Transgressions in Visual Discourse,"Once being considered a less significant outlet of the documentary project compared to its filmic counterpart, non fiction television productions have recently become highly interesting sites for debate and analysis, under the impulse of the rise of so-called 'reality TV' or popular factual television. However, the category of 'popular factual television' has been stretched that far as to restrain its own analytic usefulness and so far, only few attempts have been made at clarifying the variety of categories and tendencies that are actually at work, a need that will only become more pressing as the expansion and hybridization of popular factual formats continues. In this paper, an argument is made for a taxonomic approach to the study of popular factual television. A typology is introduced that consists of seven distinctive categories, which are distinguished according to the nature of their respective 'reality' claims in terms of the depicted referent and the (documentary) aesthetics of the imagery. The use of specific filmic and pro-filmic techniques to create a sense of the 'real' and to add documentary legitimacy to the imagery, is the sole characteristic that all popular factual formats to a greater or lesser extent share. The discussion of the taxonomy indicates the need for the development of a methodological tool for the (hybrid) analysis of visual hybrid media."

Affect-as-information theory would predict that the frustration experienced by Web users at the onset of a pop-up would result in increased attention being paid to the local information on the hosting webpage regardless of where the local information is relative to the pop-up. Attentional spotlight model would predict that the shift in attention experienced by Web users at the onset of a pop-up would result in increased attention being paid to the webpage information located around the pop-up, regardless of whether the information is local or global. Sixty (N = 60) participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (pop-up or no pop-up). Participants were asked to look at two fictitious online newspapers for 2 minutes each. For the participants in the pop-up condition, an ad irrelevant to the content of the online newspaper popped on top of the webpage 10 seconds after each newspaper was loaded on the screen. The two webpages were structured so that they contained both global information (story titles and headlines) and local information (detailed leads). Participants recall and recognition of peripheral vs. focal information (determined based on the location of the pop-up) and global vs. local information (determined based on the type of information) were assessed in the end. Frustration and attention levels were also measured via self-reports and physiological measures. Practical and theoretical implications are further discussed."
2006-1628,Visual Representation of the Female in the Turkish Press,Gender and Culture in Visual Signs,Visual Studies,,,Extended Abstract,Visual Representation of the Female in the Turkish Press,Gender and Culture in Visual Signs,"This study analyses the female visuals in six Turkish newspapers representing different socio-political positions. The study argues that the exclusion of visuals from earlier analyses creates a pitfall and aims to expand the previous research with the incorporation of visual analysis. Secondly, as is the case in previous research, approaching secular and religious press as two separate camps tends to obscure the similarities between religious and secular newspapers and the differences within secular and within religious newspapers with respect to the depiction of women. Therefore this study aims not only to look at the differences between secular and religious newspapers in Turkey but also to the differences within them in terms of the visual representation of women. Methodologically iconographical analysis of Erwin Panofsky is employed to analyze the characteristics and meanings of the visuals. In theoretical terms theories of modernity and gender in relation to Muslim contexts inform the study."

Rather than attribute a single, political voice to organic consumption defined by a certification scheme, I aim to understand heuristically how individuals and groups talk about and promote organic consumption. Ethnographic discourse analysis of two Internet discussion groups reveals that one group accepts organic consumption as a way to ""do something,"" where organic consumption is a means of ""speaking"" about ""values"" and ""politics."" The other group rejects organic consumption as an accepted means of communication, instead describing it as an alternative to public, political solutions to concerns about genetically modified foods. The rhetorical analysis argues that organic promotion materials constitute two types of organic consumers: tasteful consumers and political actors. Together the ethnographic discourse analysis and rhetorical criticism qualify Micheletti's treatment of organic consumption and suggest alternative voices of organic consumption."

Besides interpersonal interaction with doctors during a medical visit a few times per year, or other interpersonal communication, it is from the news media that the public learns about the social norms of the doctor-patient relationship in a society. Therefore this study explored which one of these 2 groups-doctors or patients- speak out in the masss media about their relationships , in order to examine who is the group dominating the media discourse on doctor-patient relationships. By analyzing the three leading Taiwanese newspapers of the past 12 years , this study found that newspapers were more likely to print the negative rather than the positive doctor-patient relationships . In addition, doctors were more likely to be the source of the news than the patients, and regarding the doctor-patient relationship issue, more letters from doctors were published than from patients. As a result, what the public learned from the media is heavily biased towards the doctors point of view. In the media coverage , patients appeared mostly in the negative manner. Further qualitative research needs to explore how the images of doctors and patients are represented in the media, and how this influences the lay persons perception of doctor-patient relationships."

A random-sample telephone survey empirically examined the relationship between Hong Kong residents sense of political efficacy and their propensity to participate in a protest march against the possible enactment of a bill which deals with acts of treason, secession, sedition, and theft of state secretes. This law-making process actually brought to an unprecedented political crisis in Hong Kong history. Results show that people with high degree of internal efficacy and low degree of external efficacy are particularly likely to engage in a protest march, suggesting the existence of a universal pattern identified in political participation research."

In doing so, Deadwood deviates in three key ways from the conventions of the American monomythic formula that informs the Western genre: First, there is no Edenic community to redeem. Second, the morality, practicality, and psychological satisfaction associated with retributive justice are called into question. While the community faces a few exterior threats to its existence from Native Americans and the United States federal government, these threats are remote and might never be realized; the immediate threats to communal life come not from without, but from within. And third, there is the felt loss of a clear moral compass, and with this loss doubts are raised regarding conventional mythic notions of the hero, and indeed of heroism itself."

The media space is a critical site for post-conflict reconstruction, particularly when factional conflict and violence persist after the war, as in the present case of Iraq. Media / information intervention refers to the means of getting involved in a humanitarian crisis where there is evidence that the mass media have been manipulated to incite hatred and violence. It will be demonstrated that media intervention as a practice has ambiguous legal support in international law, due to the conflict between the jus cogens principle of non-intervention and the limited derogation of that principle provided by Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and by exceptions to allow restriction of speech provided in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). A review of the legal framework in international law that has an impact on media intervention campaigns will be provided. Reference will be made to media intervention experiences in previous post-war situations, e.g. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Rwanda, Cambodia. It will be argued that between an absolute prohibition of intervention and a set of specific conditions allowing derogation to non-interventionism, lies a small window of opportunity  a limited exceptionism  for cultivating a media space that respects human rights. The stakeholders involved in rebuilding the media space should grasp the significance of this narrow opportunity to establish peace and security in post-conflict zones."

In order to understand how journalists negotiate the perils of war journalism, this paper takes as its site of inquiry the discourse connected to the deaths of two prominent journalists killed in the early stages of the Iraq war in 2003: NBC reporter David Bloom and Washington Post columnist Michael Kelly. The discourse arising from their deaths is traced across television, print, and radio outlets as journalists attempt to make sense of the death of the two journalists by connecting their loss to interconnected narratives related to bravery, volunteerism, sacrifice, and witnessing. Although the coverage is not monolithic, a discursive construct of the KIA journalist develops that situates the death of the journalist in the space of combat within broader tropes connected to the normative role of journalism in a democracy. In this way, Kelly and Bloom become interpreted in a framework that strives to increase the cultural authority of journalism by positioning journalists as representations of the collective good."

Despite the fact that investigative journalism is so often applauded in public, its core concept is surprisingly rarely defined. What is watchdog journalism? How does it differ from other types of journalism? How much, and what kind of, investigations are required to enable it to be labeled as investigative journalism? Another question still remaining concerns how watchdog journalism is perceived by different sections of society. They may agree upon the importance of this press function, but do they agree upon the definition of the concept?
The objective of this paper is to investigate local investigative journalism somewhat further by interviewing local politicians and local journalists about their attitudes to and definitions of the concept, their perceptions of its occurrence and their perceptions about existing obstacles to its implementation in daily journalistic practices.
The study displayed different perceptions of investigative journalism among local politicians and local journalists. The latter felt that it was very important to check the realities behind official statements and declarations and try to discover news where there appeared to be an attempt to hide it from the public. Politicians would like investigative journalism to reflect as many views and perspectives as possible."

Within the nature of these pictographs and signs, a global visual language resides with local cultural details. Starting in 2002, the WC signs which are the subject of this investigation were digitally photographed by the writer primarily in various parts of Istanbul, western and central regions of Turkey. The signs within this collection challenge the way our thinking is ordered with unsettling juxtapositions in the way they portray proposed modern identities, as well as the expression of certain local identities on public bathroom doors in relation to time, place and people.

The significance and ideology of these everyday design elements is discussed within the context of the westernization and modernization process in Turkey starting from the 1930s and the tension of global and local. This investigation is conducted through brief information on Turkish graphic design, WC sign-makers in Turkey, pictographs and public bathrooms and the comparative interpretation of WC signs among themselves and in relation to the public space in which they occur such as like restaurants, bars, cafés, mosques, cinemas and heterotopic places like museums and gay-transvestite bars."

Representations of Lesbian Lives on the ""The L Word""","Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies Interest Group Interactive Paper Session","The recent Showtime series The L Word marks one of the first dramatized representations of prominent lesbian characters. While many popular culture scholars are focusing attention on the recent gaying of television narrative (e.g., Battles & Hilton-Morrow, 2002; Shugart, 2003), far less attention is given to non-romantic interpersonal relationships surrounding main characters in these narratives. Scholarship in sexuality notes that many lesbian individuals must negotiate their self-disclosure to heterosexuals (Dindia, 1998), and that this can be challenging for forming relationships and maintaining identity (XXXX, 2004) . Ultimately, this essay argues that despite the gains in visibility and even in intimacy, the show offers little to no coping mechanisms for the underlying problems of heterosexism and homophobia other than avoidance, and furthermore, that these images merely replace conventional representations of heteronormativity and homophobia, ultimately subjecting lesbian representation to a continued hegemonic position in the landscape of television."

Medical residents in the US are valuable to study because they are learning to become physicians; they are learning how to communicate with patients; they are also observing countless interactions between attending physicians and patients.
Twenty-eight residents participated in semi-structured interviews ranging from 30 minutes to 90 minutes in length. Data was analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Results are presented in five main areas this article. These areas are residents views of the importance of communication, resident descriptions of factors contributing to poor interactions between physicians and patients, and resident descriptions of their ideal patients and ideal physician-patient interactions. A review of study limitations and future research avenues are also presented."

While much debate ensued over the relative merits of unilateral or embedded news coverage, other developments enabled by the proliferation of new media technologies  from digital cameras and computer notebooks to satellite telephones  received far less attention. Among these new approaches to reporting war was the warblog, a mode we argue deserves particular scrutiny.
This paper examines the emergent forms and practices of blogging as a rudimentary approach to war reporting. We have not attempted the difficult task of comprehensively surveying the multiplicity of warblogs concerned with the invasion and its aftermath. Rather, we have chosen to investigate a small number of warblogs, grouping them into three categories: warblogs associated with major news organisations; warblogs produced by freelance or sojo reporters; and warblogs posted by personal or amateur journalists, including Iraqi citizens. In the course of our analysis, we draw upon insights provided by bloggers themselves, both from interviews conducted by ourselves as well as from other sources. We suggest that these writers valued the use of blogging as journalism for the ways in which it  characterised as it is by informality, subjectivity and eye-witness experience  cuts across the fundamentals of ostensibly impartial news reporting. In evaluating warbloggings relative strengths and limitations, explore the extent to which it represents a challenge to certain longstanding tenets of war reporting."

To answer this question, we will use Edward Halls (1976) theory as the primary conceptual lens. Specifically, we will employ a cultural dimension called context which explains the variations in terms of high-context-versus-low context. Other literature in this domain will also be used to explore the various aspects of cultural impacts. We are proposing a research design that uses content analysis to look at the WSIS public archival email messages. From this source material, we will present descriptive statistical analysis and in-depth descriptions for each of the decision-making stages described above, from a cultural stance."

In-depth interviews with West Indian women revealed that they distinguished themselves through the othering of American culture, national pride, and textual poaching of television texts, while they pursued incorporation by adopting the beauty ideals and the style of dress of the U.S., as well as non-cultural identification with television characters. This project shows that media engagement is reflective of identity, and, more specifically, that the manner in which immigrant audiences connect with media texts is indicative of the level of their belongingness in the host country and the nature of their cultural hybridity."

The MTV localized strategy should be interpreted not in context of globalization but in context of glocalization, because the MTV strategy for entry into foreign markets means that localized programming and localized business mode are more successful rather than standardization or unification strategy. Thus, the study investigated the MTV localized programming and business mode especially in East Asia. The results showed that Viacoms MTV used joint venture as the localized business mode in East Asia, because the business mode is more efficient and beneficial in culturally more distant and politically, financially or economic riskier. In terms of the localized programming, MTV Korea, MTV China and MTV Japan used more local staffs and local language, but three MTV showed different trends in types of programs to air. MTV Korea aired more local programs, but MTV Japan aired more western music. MTV chinas programming more depended on neighbour nations."

Unsettling A Priori and A Posteriori Approaches,"Communication, Interaction, Power","We argue that the ways in which communication scholars explicitly or implicitly define and characterize communication, the terminologies used and the assumptions employed, guide the ways in which they define and utilize communication theories and practices. We provide a systematization of the diverse definitions and understandings of communication, proposing a widening metatheoretical framework, a broad classificatory scheme. Taking into account the interpretation of communication as essence or appearance, we classify communication definitions as a priori or a posteriori, as essentializing or as questioning preestablished communicative patterns. Considering the approach of communication as static or dynamic, we classify a priori communication definitions into product and process, and considering the approach of communication as cultural or political, we categorize a posteriori communication definitions as ritual and praxis. Then, we discuss the forms and implications of a priori communication definitions, planning to explore a posteriori definitions of communication in a further study, in an attempt to unsettle the ways in which What is communication? in asked and answered."

Thus, through a case study of a cleaning service company mainly composed of Korean immigrants, this study investigated the diverse mechanisms of building trust among Korean cleaning service workers, building managers, and clients. This study shows the diversity of trust building processes based on the three factors of trustworthiness--ability, benevolence, integrity--presented by Mayer, Davis and Schoorman(1995) and one additional factor--cultural familiarity."

Through in-depth interviews, Korean interviewees could be named as cynical opponents, savvy negotiators, or pure accepters in relation to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) news story readings. One important communality across all interviewees was that they considered CSR news stories to be polluted or affected by public relations activity regardless of the fact that they were cynical opponents or pure accepters. Interviews demonstrated that Koreans basically assumed CSR news stories are the outcome of publicity rather than the outcome of investigative news reporting by journalists. The degree of belief about information pollution on CSR news stories leveraged their decoding choices: oppositional, negotiable, and dominant decoding."

Unraveling why political confidence has varied in different crises scenarios is a complex task. This paper discusses a model containing reasons for explaining confidence in political institutions and in politicians, which focuses on public perceptions of crises management. It is assumed that these perceptions are based on the interdependent influences of the actual crises management, the available information and the public evaluation criteria. Thus, changes in political confidence might be due to a change in any, or indeed all, of these variables.
Against this backdrop, the purpose of this paper is to study the Swedish case with regards to the crisis management of the 2004 tsunami disaster, focusing on the public´s perceptions of the media, the government and political leadership, and how it affected the confidence in political institutions and leaders."
2006-1661,When Available Resources Become Negative Resources: Effects of Cognitive Overload on Memory Sensitivity and Criterion,Understanding Cognitive Processing of Media Messages,Information Systems,,,Paper,When Available Resources Become Negative Resources: Effects of Cognitive Overload on Memory Sensitivity and Criterion,Understanding Cognitive Processing of Media Messages,"This study examines the effects of structural complexity and information density of television messages on memory sensitivity and criterion bias. Results support the theoretical prediction that as information density increases, at a given level of resource allocation, available resources decrease. As a result, memory sensitivity declines and criterion bias becomes more liberal. When required resources exceed available resources  that is, when a state of cognitive overload is reached  both memory sensitivity and criterion bias drop dramatically. The results are discussed in terms of both practical and theoretical importance, particularly as they provide support for the contention that secondary task reaction times are often very fast during highly complex messages because the system is overloaded and therefore resources are shifted from the primary task to the secondary task."

In a 2 (participant sex: male vs. female) x 2 (individuating information: depersonalization vs. personalization) x 2 (need for public individuation: high vs. low) between-subjects design experiment, participants made a decision about social dilemmas and exchanged their choices and supporting arguments with three ostensible partners via computer. As predicted, depersonalization led to (a) a more extreme perception of the group norm, (b) better recall of the interactants arguments, and (c) more positive evaluations of the arguments quality through group identification, albeit only among women. However, depersonalization increased conformity only among those with high need for public individuation and among women and the effects were mediated by group identification and extremity of the perceived group norm. Implications are discussed in light of the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE)."

Based on fieldwork done on the making of a minority language television channel in Singapore, the paper demonstrates how the ethnic label may be conceptually and politically problematic.

The channel in question is targeted at the Singapore Malay, who is demographically, economically and politically marginal. The irony is that the Chinese dominated state is geographically in the heart of a sprawling region some called Alam Melayu or the Malay World. The state-owned channel aims to equip (the Malays) with the attitudes, values and instincts that make them vibrant and proud citizens (Channel News Asia, 30/1/2000).

The ethnography, however, shows how its producers, mostly ethnic Malays themselves, constantly shift between several worlds and modes of identifications: between regional affinities and local pressures; between the demands of the state and the lure of global markets and images; between televising a unique Singapore Malay culture and the practical concerns of filling airtime with programmes gleamed from transnational others with cultural affinities. Television production is shot through with contingency and the impossibility of articulatory closure."

Drawing on Jablins (1987) turnover model, the present study examines how communication and identification relate to an individuals intent to leave an organization, the latter of which is often considered to be an antecedent of turnover. To explore those relationships, we conducted a longitudinal study in a municipal government located in the northeastern United States. Results revealed that, taken together, the communication variables examined in this study predicted intent to leave. Findings also revealed that multiple identification variables explained a significant amount of variance in intent to leave. This study offers an extension to turnover literature in several ways. First, it integrates individual level attitudes including identification with organization level relationships within the organizational social network. Second, this study moves beyond a simply network that measures solely the existence or lack of a network connection. Instead, it employs social network measures that provide information about the multiplex nature of relationships in the organization. Finally, this study offers evidence that points to the power of multiplex relationships with respect to minimizing turnover in organizations."

A case study was developed through interviews with university insiders and journalists as well as through participant observation. A quantitative content analysis of newspaper coverage of the crisis helped quantify and verify the field research. The study looks at what happens when there is an absence of effective public relations. The case offers insights about issues management, media relations, crisis communication, and reputation management.
In this case it appeared that the media were used to pressure a university president to resign without due consideration to the damage to the reputation of the institution that would result. This is the converse of a case study that illustrates best practices, but it is useful for assessing what can happen to an organization and its reputation when there is a public relations void."

This study takes a life span developmental communicative approach to examine the relationships between communication competency, humor orientation, and relational satisfaction in the older adult parent-adult child dyad when the parent has been diagnosed with cancer. Results indicate that communication competency is associated with humor orientation and relational satisfaction while humor itself may operate in more complex ways within the family cancer context. As predicted, communication competency had a significantly positive correlation with both humor orientation and relational satisfaction. Humor orientation was not significantly correlated with relational satisfaction. Content analysis of open-ended data revealed that discussing diagnosis and treatment procedures with children was often a satisfying conversation whereas withholding information had an adverse affect. The discussion of parents' feelings during the cancer period was complex. Humor was often used as a coping or relief function for discussing side effects of cancer treatment."

Despite the beauties and uniqueness of each, when two different cultures come together, there is a strong likelihood that some clashes may occur. This paper is an attempt to show how cultural differences among Western teachers and Arab students in university classrooms can lead to clashes during classroom interaction. As Hofstede (1986) observed, when teacher and student come from different culturesmany perplexities can arise (p. 30). However, unlike Hofstede who puts the burden of adaptation on teachers, this papers looks equally at both teachers and students as partners in the adaptation process and holds both responsible for understanding and resolving classroom conflict. After examining real culturally conflicting incidents, the paper ends with proposing a framework for the purpose of analyzing and resolving classroom cultural conflicts."

An Exploration of Anchoring Effect in the Third-Person Perceptions,Advances in Effects Research I,"To address the issue of question-order effect in the third-person effect research, this study explores whether and how question order affects both individual message effect estimates and the underlying cognitive mechanisms leading to those estimates. Analyzing data from a web-based experiment with three different messages (reality TV shows, Internet pornography materials, and Public Service announcements), this study finds that question order does have a significant impact on not only the size of perceptual gaps but also the magnitude of the estimated effects on self and others respectively: Estimates effects on a peer are significantly greater in distant-other-first question order condition than self-first condition, while estimated effects on self do not vary across question-order conditions. In addition, the results also show that question order has some effect on cognitive mechanisms leading to the perceived message effects. For socially undesirable messages, the causal structures linking cognitive antecedents and perceived media effect on a peer are significantly different between two question-order conditions. Implications of these results for understanding the third-person effect and directions for future studies are discussed."

However, when examined through an ethical perspective, can the conventions and practices of U.S. journalism that are so closely intertwined with existing power structures still be considered fair and ethical? And more specifically, if we examine journalistic identity and its ties to whiteness  a very particular and privileged position in society  can we ethically justify current news norms? This inquiry stresses that journalists construct rather than merely reflect reality and argues that this requires a different kind of ethical analysis, on that moves away from the usual minimalistic rights approach to journalistic ethics."

Profiling Blog Users by Media Use and Political Involvement,"Weblogs: Producers, Users and Effects on the Public Sphere","This study found that blog users are different from non-users in their media use and political involvement. The study conducted an e-mail survey of students at two large American public universities after the 2004 U.S. Presidential election. It is found that blog users seek guidance in blogs more frequently than other gratifications. It is also found they are more likely than non-users to heavily use text-rich news media and infotainment. The study shows that blog users were more likely to discuss the election than non-users. Those who answered that they seek guidance and surveillance gratifications in blogs are more likely to participate in the discussion, and are more likely to attach bumper stickers, than those who answered that they seek other gratifications. The findings suggest blogs may function as forums for discussion of public affairs."

An Exploratory Look at Role Theory in Fund Raising,Public Relations High Density Session: Young Talent,"Fund raising has been conducted in various shapes and sizes for decades but is only now establishing itself as a true profession. The dynamics involved with certain professional roles include a clear definition of the field and a description of those that perform the tasks and functions of that field. Furthermore, the roles of practitioners exemplify the duties of the profession and the level of competence needed to establish a model for best practices in fund raising.
The purpose of this study is to explore the theory-driven research of role theory in public relations and its application to fund raising. This objective will be accomplished by examining, Broom and Smiths role theory (1969), Spitzberg and Cupachs communication competence theory (1984), and Rokeachs (1973) instrumental values (1966). In accomplishing these objectives, two research questions will be answered and used as a base for further study in fund raising."

Additionally, it utilized accommodation theory and its connection to commitment to form hypotheses, which predicted connections between the independent variables of attachment style and gender and the dependent variables of relational repair strategies and types of commitment. Multivariate analysis of variance found evidence for both attachment style and gender explanations for the use of relational repair items. There was also a limited connection between attachment style and commitment but none between gender and commitment."

It is pointed out that the main problem in previous literature is to treat the internet and its users as general and homogeneous identities. The present study calls for the specification of internet users on the basis of personality, internet use in terms of social or non-social purpose, and the targets the users interact with. Two hypotheses and four research questions are proposed to examine who interact with whom through what type of internet use. Results show that social use of the internet is not related to loneliness, but positively related to internet users sociability. Sociability does not moderate the relationship between social use of the internet and loneliness. Social use of the internet with family, friends and online friends are not related to loneliness respectively. Internet users desire to have online friends are positively related to rejection by others and negatively related to perceived social skills and evaluation of interpersonal relationships, while no associations were found between satisfaction with current online relationships and rejection, perceived skills, and evaluation of relationship."

A survey of 203 Midwestern residents showed that those with favorable views of DTCA were more likely to inquire and request an advertised drug they saw. However, the association was only significant for those with high perceived knowledge in health and medicine. When their perceived knowledge was low, despite positive views of DTCA, their intention to inquire and request a specific drug was not significantly increased."

While the song could be criticized as simply pandering to a popular opinion, Fantasy Theme Analysis reveals a more subtle rhetorical vision and details about how that vision was developed and maintained. An analysis of characters, settings and actions positions television as the location for a struggle between like-minded protagonists and ambiguous antagonists who have removed footage of the September 11th, 2001 attacks from the rhetor's television. In supporting cultivation theory, television is found to be the frame through which the rhetor's vision is informed, restricted and ultimately sanctioned as universally correct."

From an Individual Difference Perspective,Mediated Messages and Information Processing in Individuals and Groups,"Many studies on the effects of sexually explicit materials have focused primarily on intentional exposure to such content. Recently, however, researchers have begun to address the issue of the unintentional exposure to pornography on the Internet. However, there is no study on the effects of individual differences in Internet users responses to unwanted sexually explicit materials. This study uses the Sexual Opinion Survey and Hare Self-Report Psychopathy to measure college students sexual and antisocial dispositions. It found that samples those high in sexual disposition were more likely to expose themselves, by clicking a message or link, to unwanted Internet pornography when they happened to come across it during Interne use. Moreover, those high in antisocial disposition were more likely to click than those with a low antisocial disposition. Finally, those who were high both in sexual and antisocial dispositions were more likely to expose themselves to sexually explicit materials than other groups."

Until recently, the communication discipline has conducted minimal inquiry into code-switching practices among diverse language groups, especially those in Hawaii. Redressing this oversight in the literature, this article investigated code-switching communicative practices among Standard English and Hawaii Creole English (Pidgin) speakers on the Big Island of Hawaii. Findings indicate that respondents perceive that Standard English should be spoken in most employment (hiring) or scholastic situations, especially when interacting with tourists, teachers, or mainlanders. However, Pidgin was widely practiced, by Locals in social, workplace, and educational interactions to maintain group solidarity, and enhance goal achievement. Pidgin was reported to be the most preferred language of respondents and is usually spoken in routine social and family interactions. Results also suggest that language is perceived to be indicative of group membership (e.g., Pidgin speakers are considered ""Local"", Standard English speakers commonly viewed as ""Mainlander"" or ""Haole""). Moreover, individuals who violate language norms for their normative group are viewed negatively and ostracized (e.g., Locals who move to the mainland and return speaking Standard English, or Haoles who are incompetent in their attempt to speak Pidgin)."

The Effects of Insufficiency on Patients Health-Related Internet Use,Media Enjoyment: New Directions in Enjoyment and Emotion Research,"The Internet has been emerged as an important source for persons with cancer to obtain health-related information. However, little attention has been made to understand the underlying mechanism of why people with cancer use the Internet. To understand why a person with cancer obtains health-related information over the Internet, we conceptualized insufficient needs, a gap between actual and desired needs. We identified two main reasons, information and emotional support, why persons with cancer use the Internet, developed information insufficiency and emotional support insufficiency, and tested their influences on patients use of the Internet. Data collected from 122 women with breast cancer was used to test several hypothesized relationships among insufficiency and their use of Internet. Finding reveled that emotional support insufficiency was positively related to the amount of Internet use. In addition, we found that insufficient needs that mainly fulfill their needs determined patients types of Internet use. That is, those who felt insufficiency in information spent more time in finding out specific features of health Information, and those who felt insufficient emotional support spent more time in discussion group. Implication for future research on insufficiency, and the Internet use are discussed."

Motivational Predictors of Exposure to Violent Video Games,Media Enjoyment: New Directions in Enjoyment and Emotion Research,Mass Communication,,,Paper,Why is Virtual Fighting Fun? Motivational Predictors of Exposure to Violent Video Games,Media Enjoyment: New Directions in Enjoyment and Emotion Research,"The frequent and explicit display of violent acts in video games has raised concerns about the effect of such games on aggression. Related research has neglected the question of the enjoyment inherent to committing violent acts in video games. Based on relevant theories, three dimensions of the motivational appeal of video game violence were identified: The aesthetic pleasure of destruction, situational self-enhancement through competence/success and power/control, and elaboration of a (hyper-)masculine identity. It is argued that violent video games serve these functions very effectively and that, as a consequence, individuals with stronger preferences for (at least one of) these functions display more frequent exposure to violent video games. An online survey among video game players (N = 2596) provided support for the assumptions and revealed the aesthetics of destruction as most prominent determinant of exposure to violent video games. Implications for the media effects perspective are discussed."

While a proliferation of research exists on this topic, a relative lack of consensus is apparent in the ways this construct has been studied. Nevertheless, continual efforts are being made to delineate the construct of psychological abuse in more precise ways. In particular, Spitzberg and his colleagues (e.g., Dailey, Lee, & Spitzberg, 2002; Lee, Dailey, & Spitzberg, 2002; Spitzberg, Dailey, & Lee, 2004), in their assessment of psychological abuse and its related domains (e.g., bullying, conflict), assert that a common underlying feature of existing conceptual and operational approaches to this construct is that identity plays a major role in the perpetration of, as well as the reception of, psychologically abusive behavior. Since the ways that individuals think of themselves (i.e., their self-concept) influences their thoughts, feelings, and actions, we should be better able to understand the construct of psychological abuse, specifically what it entails, why it occurs, and its effects from an identity-oriented perspective. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the role of identity in psychological abuse. In doing so, an identity-based theoretical model is presented to provide a basis for understanding present, as well as future, psychological abuse research."

Favoritism Towards Similar Roles and Social Judgments Towards Criminality,Anthropomorphization in Computer and Video Game Use,"Role playing is a distinctive feature of most of the video games. In a 2 by 2 mixed design experiment, we investigated the effect of role-playing a violent game on judgments of real-life similar roles and attitudes towards violence and crimes. Our findings show that role playing a character in the game leads to biased judgments towards similar roles. People who role-played a police officer who committed unjustifiable crimes on duty tend to give less punitive judgments to police officers committed similar crimes in real life. The paper concludes with theoretical implications for video game research and practical implications for jury selections and health education. Limitations and plans for future research are also discussed."

The Social Identification Theory was was tested through regression analyses of aggregated cross-national opinion data on an indicator of national economic development and other national characteristics. Findings suggest that ingroup favoritism can be found at the cross-national level. Higher levels of development are associated with higher evaluation of ones own country relative to the world. This relationship is mediated by opinions of how future generations will fare; that is, as belief in a better future increases, evaluation of ones own country relative to the world likewise increases. Given this contingent relationship, the corollary theoretical assertion of the Social Identification Theory as regards group boundaries is supported.

This paper makes the overarching argument that theories of intergroup relations should be considered as frameworks that the United States can use in carrying out cross-national research towards crafting its foreign policy."

Within this paper, we focus in particular on their roles as agents of peace. Data collection involved a combination of participant observation, interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions. As peacebuilders, both individually and collectively, women engage in a wide variety of activities, including working with humanitarian agencies and the government as well as assisting IDPs (internally displaced persons) and returnees to initiate income-generating activities. Their roles as agents of peace are, however, generally ignored and marginalized by the organizers of formal peacebuilding processes. This contradictory positioning is explored along with the personal obstacles the women believe must be addressed if they are ever to assume a significant role at the bargaining table."

We hereby present one very recent German qualitative study and its findings on this matter. Long interviews were conducted to allow thirteen female public relations experts to explain their view on womens situation in PR in general, and to describe their own careers. Findings reveal the evolution of a PR bunny stereotype that adds a negative touch to the female image as natural born communicators and support the argument that women prefer (1) the organizational culture of PR agencies, (2) agency-specific job tasks, and (3) agency-specific work processes. Possible consequences for female PR practitioners and PR as a profession are discussed  beyond the boundaries of national research."

However, little is known about what factors influence an individuals decision to seek medical attention based on the findings of their information search. As the health care industry hastily transitions to a more consumer-driven paradigm, obtaining a better understanding of the health decision-making behaviors of individuals becomes paramount to those interested in effective health communication. This study examines previous research on the relationship of online health information seeking and interpersonal discussion about health on health care utilization decisions such as visiting a doctor. Further, this study suggests that an individuals level of health anxiety moderates these relationships."

An additional group of university students reviewed tapes of the most and least effective teaching assistants from the surveyed classes. The majority of student responses, whether elicited via survey or tape analysis, focused on Communicative Competence (instructors overall speaking ability, verbal and nonverbal communication skills, ability to adapt material to the students knowledge level, level of clarity, organizational skills, and ability to generate interest). Students responses also focused on Concern for Students (instructors level of respect for students, immediacy and interactive skills, and level of flexibility) and other instructional features, but Communicative Competence behaviors seem more closely related to student evaluations, especially negative evaluations, of their instructors on the first day of class."

The knowledge thus produced is applied back upon the population. Surveillance is mediated by a complex socio-technical infrastructure, distributed across many institutional settings. Interventions reveal the shape of the infrastructure, what work it does, and for whom.
From 1997 to 2002, Zero-Knowledge Systems developed and marketed an internet pseudonymity service. Their travails revealed an obdurate infrastructure, in which corporate actors resist the introduction of legal rights for data subjects. Laws will alter the practices of data holders, but those laws do not impede practices of the private generation of social knowledge. No coherent frame of thought guides individual responses to surveillance, in part because of a fissure between the embodied experience of surveillance and the practices of data extraction, manipulation, and use."
