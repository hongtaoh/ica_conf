Removing output files of failed job scrape_2014_onward_paper_session since they might be corrupted:
../data/interim/session_df_2014.csv, ../data/interim/author_df_2014.csv, ../data/interim/paper_df_2014.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
