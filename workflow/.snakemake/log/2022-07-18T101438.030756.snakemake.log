Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 107 of /Users/hongtaoh/Desktop/github/ica_conf/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../data/interim/paper_df_2003.csv
../data/interim/author_df_2003.csv
../data/interim/paper_df_2004.csv
../data/interim/author_df_2004.csv completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
