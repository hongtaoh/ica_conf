       "'This paper reports the results of two studies designed to compare predictors of enjoyment of reality-based and fictional TV programming. In Study 1, 260 adults completed a survey of their cognitive and emotional reactions to either the fictional or reality-based programming that they generally watch. In Study 2, 502 adults completed a similar survey but with a particular reality-based or fictional program in mind. Results of both studies suggest voyeurism (i.e., curiosity about others) is likely a distinguishing marker of reality-based and fictional programming. However, different predictors of enjoyment for reality-based and fictional programming suggests there are as many differences among types of reality-based programming as between reality-based versus fictional programming. Both studies also found more variance explained for the enjoyment of reality-based versus fictional programming. Further, certain gratifications (learning, surprise, suspense, and self-awareness) had quite different effects on enjoyment depending on the context in which they arose. The discussion presents arguments advocating the need to broaden the conceptual understanding of gratifications, to Sreassess the degree of activity necessary for their acquisition, and to better understand their link to media enjoyment and possible subsequent behaviors.'"

       "'This paper reports the results of two studies designed to compare predictors of enjoyment of reality-based and fictional TV programming. In Study 1, 260 adults completed a survey of their cognitive and emotional reactions to either the fictional or reality-based programming that they generally watch. In Study 2, 502 adults completed a similar survey but with a particular reality-based or fictional program in mind. Results of both studies suggest voyeurism (i.e., curiosity about others) is likely a distinguishing marker of reality-based and fictional programming. However, different predictors of enjoyment for reality-based and fictional programming suggests there are as many differences among types of reality-based programming as between reality-based versus fictional programming. Both studies also found more variance explained for the enjoyment of reality-based versus fictional programming. Further, certain gratifications (learning, surprise, suspense, and self-awareness) had quite different effects on enjoyment depending on the context in which they arose. The discussion presents arguments advocating the need to broaden the conceptual understanding of gratifications, to Sreassess the degree of activity necessary for their acquisition, and to better understand their link to media enjoyment and possible subsequent behaviors.'"
