In contrast, in many non-mediated contexts, the concept of speakers\\' rights of access frequently is defined in terms of the speaker\\'s own First Amendment right of access to audiences. This paper explores the distinctions between these differing interpretations of a speaker\\'s access rights and argues that the concept of a speaker\\'s right of access to audiences merits a more prominent position in media regulation and policy. This paper then explores the implications of such a shift in perspective for media regulation and policy-making.',\n",

Intrinsic and extrinsic motives were operationalized as personal interest and expectations of future relevant discussion, respectively. Respondents received a manipulation that elevated the expectation of discussing certain topics with unknown students and then viewed a newscast featuring these topics. Personal interest in and information acquisition of each message were assessed, along with anticipations of topical discussion with friends or family. Results showed that intrinsic and extrinsic interests related positively to information acquisition indicators for the relevant news stories. In addition, extrinsic motives were found to influence intrinsic motives. Implications for viewing traditional media effects research in conjunction with epistemic motivation research are discussed.', 'number_of_authors': None, 'year': 2005, 'session': 'Why and How We Communication: The Role of Motivation', 'division': 'Information Systems'}\n",

Following\\nKellner\\x92s (1995) concept of \\x93ideological critique,\\x94 I first examine the narrative of Independence\\nDay through a comparison with Fight Club. Both movies portray analogous scenes of crumbling\\ntowers but in two different ideological contexts, which the comparison intends to highlight.\\nSecond, I examine the ideological subtext of Independence Day with those of two key speeches\\ngiven by president Bush. This second \\x91diagnostic\\x92 comparison offers evidence that similar\\nideologies underlie the narrative in Independence Day and Bush\\x92s speeches. I argue, therefore,\\nthat the intertextual references between Independence Day and the World Trade Center tragedy\\nwere functional in activating and promoting the hegemonic ascent of an interpretive framework\\nthat is consistent with the one proposed by the Bush administration.', 'number_of_authors': None, 'year': 2005, 'session': 'Intertextual Narratives of Time and Space', 'division': 'Popular Communication'}\n",

       "  'abstract': 'When the issue of speakers\\' rights of access arises in media regulation and policy contexts, the focus typically is on the concept of speakers\\' rights of access \"to the media,\" or \"to the press.\" This right typically is premised on the audience\\'s need for access to diverse sources and content. In contrast, in many non-mediated contexts, the concept of speakers\\' rights of access frequently is defined in terms of the speaker\\'s own First Amendment right of access to audiences. This paper explores the distinctions between these differing interpretations of a speaker\\'s access rights and argues that the concept of a speaker\\'s right of access to audiences merits a more prominent position in media regulation and policy.

On the basis of in-depth interviews with Japanese-speaking informants in the United States, I analyze: (1) the episodes in which informants' cultural knowledge about appropriate conduct was affected or broadened by their engaging in accounting practices with American English speakers; and (2) the cases in which informants did not pursue the problematic events that they had faced with English speakers because, in reality, they saw difficulty in doing so. In the latter cases, informants' cultural knowledge and their perception of the boundaries tended to remain as they had been before the problematic events. The study supports the idea that boundaries of speech communities are dynamic but also suggests that they would not change so easily because participants often choose not to engage in accounting episodes.\",\n",

Virtual World Entertainment -- an early producer of virtual reality games --set up an elaborate system of controls. Virtual World adopted structural controls to train its fans in its own ideology of textualism. This ideology promoted the belief in the unity of the BattleTech world, encouraged players to accept the fit between the entertainment center and the fictional representation of the BattleTech universe and to take the text at face value as an expression of competition. Structural controls already informed the reception of the text by customers in their performance, but this preparation happens to different degrees based upon a person's exposure and socialization. This example is used to explore the nexus of language and technology as a factor in technological diversity, which includes both technological variety and multimedia coordination.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Road rage is a type of interpersonal conflict episode. The ways in which drivers use their vehicles to rectify other people's offensive driving implicates the symbolic nature of road rage. Participants offered detailed accounts of recent road rage experiences. These were coded to portray the precipitating actions, behavioral responses, emotional reactions, and attributions that people might have for their own and other people's driving behavior. Results indicate that people largely rely on Vehicular Communication (e.g., tailgating, honking the horn), Aggressive Communication (e.g., obscene gestures, threats), and Avoidance (e.g., ignore the other person) to manage road rage episodes. Emotional reactions included anger, fear, surprise, and relief. Not surprisingly, participants largely reported that the road rage episode was the responsibility of the other driver and reflected features of the other person that are stable, internal, global, intentional, and blameworthy.\",\n",

Some interesting paradoxes suggest that one challenge for New Zealand policy on genetic modification may lie in the management of multiple identities.',\n",

Because women constitute both the primary Oprah television audience and the largest U.S. book buying public, it focuses specifically upon women\\x92s involvement in the Club and their modes of engagement with Club selections. The Book Club\\x92s astonishing success, I argue, was attributable in part to the carefully considered communication strategies through which participants, Winfrey, and Oprah producers collectively articulated the value of books and reading specifically for women. Their deemphasizing purely aesthetic considerations, I contend, enabled women to strategize how to use Book Club selections simultaneously to distance themselves from and to engage more intensively with the demands of living in a patriarchal and otherwise socioeconomically stratified U.S. society \\x96 a relationship I call a \\x93dialectic with the everyday.\\x94 This essay thus traces the communicative processes/practices through which those involved in Oprah\\x92s Book Club articulated a highly sophisticated economy of cultural value around books and reading. It also considers the politics of their negotiations, given that many critics impugned the Club on the basis of its disinterest in judging books via received aesthetic categories.',\n",

In addition, brand attitudes, brand interest ratings and purchase intent are improved with two ad exposures over one ad exposure. The number of product attributes has also been shown to moderate ad repetition effects. Moreover, two ad variation strategies are distinguished, i.e., substantive/cosmetic variation and cosmetic variation.

       "  'abstract': 'This study analyzes rules enforced by ISPs with regulatory-like effect in the areas of ISP-user relations, content, and behavior. ISP Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies include dozens of rules that forbid constitutionally protected communicative content and behaviors and in many cases force users to grant ISPs licenses to all content uploaded or posted. Users often have no knowledge of enforcement criteria, tools, and practices. While users have liability for all effects of their use -- whether or not intended -- ISPs have almost none. The number of rules put in place by ISPs is multiplying over time. Greater protections for freedom of speech and respect for user intellectual property rights can be found in non-commercial ISPs, while there is less of both in non-US-based ISPs. Possible responses to this trend include economic approaches such as forming large user groups (eg, coalitions of libraries and/or universities) to negotiate agreements with greater protections for constitutional rights and formation of new ISPs that identify such protections as a market niche. Legal approaches include distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary speech environments in the courts, application of public forum analysis to ISPs in the courts and in Congress, and addressing ISP agreements as de facto changes in copyright law that require congressional and judicial attention. Responding to the development of a regulatory-like function for ISPs is important at this point in time because history of use is critical in public forum analyses and other areas of legal precedent.',\n",

To manipulate authenticity, texts were presented either as news articles or as novel excerpts, a treatment that proved to be effective. All seven hypotheses gained empirical support. Linear structures evoked more suspense than either structures with omission or the 'inverted pyramid.' Curiosity was higher in reaction to omission structures than it was for either linear structures or the 'inverted pyramid.' The linear structure and the omission structure both produced greater reading enjoyment than the 'inverted pyramid.'

The decision of a church to apologize to indigenous people for past actions created a conflict in which the church would wish to avoid the negative consequences of refusing to apologize but also those of a full apology. Using the standard that a true apology includes the agent and the acts of the offense, the analysis focused on whether the church or its representatives were the grammatical subject of acts described in simple active voice (vs. passive, a noun, etc.). Four of the six never used this construction for the offences and were thus equivocal apologies. The internal evidence suggests that potential legal liability is the primary barrier to taking full responsibility.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Social support is commonly assumed to protect people from the experience of psychological distress and to enhance well-being. However, past research shows that the effectiveness of social support from family members and friends varies over the life span. Both the theory of evolutionary psychology and socioemotional selectivity theory provide compelling accounts for why this may be the case. In accord with each theory, age was predicted to moderate the association between social support and the experience of depressive symptoms and loneliness. This moderational model was tested in a community-based sample of 325 adults ranging in age from 19 to 85 years. Results indicated that social support from family members and sheer contact with them, as well as social support from a spouse/partner, was most strongly and negatively related to the psychosocial problems in the younger participants. Age also moderated the association between relationship standards and loneliness. Consistent with the assumptions of socioemotional selectivity theory, older people do not appear to be as dependent as younger people are on receiving social support from diverse sources in order to maintain a sense of well-being.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although the media are perceived to be influential in putting issues on the agenda of other voters, there is less evidence that media agendas influence individual behavior. In this two-wave study conducted before and after the 2001 Australian Federal Election we investigated how the media agenda reinforced and/or undermined partisan voting intentions. Voters from the two political sides and neutral voters uniformly perceived the issues of immigration and defense as focal to others and to the election outcome, although only conservative partisans embraced both issues as important personally. Moreover, regardless of partisanship, personal importance of these issues pre-election was linked with self-reported political behavior post-election in ways that indicated that agenda issues had undermined the partisan intentions of left-wing voters and reinforced the partisan intentions of conservative voters. Results are interpreted as strong evidence for the interplay between political partisanship and the agenda context in election campaigns.',\n",

What have been the measures undertaken by the Bulgarian government and international community to combat this problem? Why are Bulgarian CD pirates proving to be so resistant to international and domestic pressure?\\nIn an attempt to address these questions adequately, the present study will be organized into five parts. Part I will provide a brief overview of major international treaties and conventions that govern current anti-piracy efforts. Part II will present an overview of Bulgarian Copyright Law as adopted in September, 1993. Part III will discuss in detail the scope and types of piracy in Bulgaria. Some estimates will be provided as to the losses incurred as a result of pirate trade. Part IV will present a detailed discussion of the measures undertaken in the past 7-8 years to combat piracy in Bulgaria. The last part, Part V, will explore the appropriateness of the measures and their effectiveness in a Bulgarian context. Specifically, it will address such factors as economic development, political history and ideology, culture of the people engaged in piracy and the adequacy of the legal system to enforce the laws.',\n",

Most important problem survey results from various polling organizations are aggregated into a series of 96 monthly time points to measure the public agenda.

This study tests a model of sexual aggression that incorporates general antisocial personality characteristics and factors specific to sexual aggression, such as sexual promiscuity, attitudes condoning violence against women and pornography consumption. Results generally indicate strong support for the hypothesized model. Regression analyses demonstrated that, as expected, hostility towards women and an impersonal orientation to sex interact to predict sexual aggression, and that pornography consumption augments this interaction. Structural equation analyses supported the hypothesis that general 'hostile' personality factors indirectly influence sexual aggression, and that this indirect relationship is mediated by hostility specifically directed at women. This research therefore successfully integrates factors common to sexual aggression research conducted in both the criminal and non-criminal populations, and models the role of pornography consumption within this broader integration.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'One major development in mass communication scholarship has been the identification of \\x93dimensions\\x94 of media effects. A dimension is a measurable quality that implies magnitude and (usually) direction, such as the time it takes for an effect to occur. Any media effect can be characterized in terms of its dimensions. A review of the literature has uncovered eight important mass media dimensions. It is proposed that these can be used to develop richer conceptualizations of media effects, to organize and evaluate the literature, and to build theory. In addition, these dimensions can be combined to form higher-level conceptualizations, as well as matrices of effects that also can be used for pedagogy, analysis and theory construction.',\n",

A national survey was conducted with 109 university and colleges soliciting administrator\\x92s judgments for their assessments of their colleagues\\x92 performance and productivity. The administrators were asked to respond to a paired-comparison questionnaire consisting of eleven faculty performance criteria, indicating in each of the 55 possible pairs which was more important as an indicator of achievement.

It is suggested that this AAI may provide an important perspective on the difficult issue of assessing faculty performance.

For the paper, I chose Dorothea Lange's 'Migrant Mother' picture which is one of the documentary photographs reproduced widely in the 1930s in America. The paper examined how each discourse directs the meaning of 'Migrant Mother' picture by analyzing how the photographic image had different meanings, along with different written texts and visual structures, depending on its presenting agency.\\nThe result shows that the Migrant Mother picture was differently represented according to its accompanying texts and other photographs -- as plight of migrant workers suffering from poverty, as a symbol of the strong will of migrant workers, as a symbol of people who need public aid, or as a symbol of people who worry about the future of America. It shows that the specific meaning of a photographic image is strongly influenced by its accompanying verbal text. The presenting agency of a photograph, however, influenced how the photograph is accepted by viewers, rather than altering the specific meaning of the photographic image. Putting these results together, internal and external contexts of a photograph work together to form a discourse, and the discourse directs a specific and implicit meaning of a photographic image.\",\n",

The central question of interest was whether a multiplicative model or an additive model of the effects of exposure and attention would better predict memory for cigarette ads. Surveys were administered to 242 adolescents. To assess exposure, the survey included questions regarding how often and how thoroughly participants read 46 magazines with varying levels of cigarette advertising (assessed using content analyses). The results indicated that an additive model of the effects of exposure and attention was superior to a multiplicative model for these data. Moreover, analyses indicated that there are psychometric problems associated with some approaches to using multiplicative measures that may cause them to provide unreliable or easily misinterpreted results. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed, including problems associated with inferring media effects from association with measures of attention, and preferred analytic strategies for examining weighted products of exposure and attention are recommended.',\n",

We observed the flag image context: with objects and people, and the camera shot types, image size and media placement by editorial choice. Day One had no flag images; those newspapers that did have a flag image on Day Two relied on the Pulitzer Prize winning photo of three firemen raising the flag in the WTC rubble; what we call a contrasting goodness with evil. The flag image went from a distance shot to more and more a central political and cultural focus with people by 2002.The meanings of the flag symbol include a protective shroud, a religious icon, a rallying point, as well as an identity mechanism, representing a change from being a mother, father, etc. to being a unifying collective, an American.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'An Empirical Analysis In To The Antecedents Of PDA Adoption: Comparing The Effects Of Innovation Factors On Attitudes And Behavioral Intent\\n\\nExtended Abstract\\n\\nAs new technologies inundate the market the understanding of key variable factors that can predict their diffusion has become paramount. The diffusion of innovations paradigm (Rogers, 1983, 1995; Rogers and Singhal, 1996) provides demand side explanations of how new innovations are communicated, evaluated, adopted, and reevaluated by consumers (Williams, Strover, and Grant, 1994). According to the theory, adoption decisions are subject to four major factors namely, adopters\\x92 personality traits, socioeconomic influences, interpersonal and mass media influences, and the perceived attributes of the innovation. These perceived attributes are key determinants of adoption decisions and thereby the rate of diffusion. The current study focuses on a relatively new innovation \\x96 the PDA or the Personal Digital Assistant, and explores key attributes that predict behavioral intention by potential adopters by applying a research model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989).\\nTAM is an adaptation of the theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) and is tailored for modeling user acceptance of information technology. TAM is a robust model that provides explanation of user behavior across a broad range of end user computing technologies and user populations (Davis et al., 1989). According to TRA, a person\\x92s performance of a specified behavior is determined by his behavioral intention (BI), and BI is jointly determined by the person\\x92s attitude (A) and subjective norms (SN) concerning the behavior in question. Similar to TRA, TAM postulates that usage is determined by BI, but differs in that BI is viewed as being jointly determined by a person\\x92s attitude toward the system (A) and perceived usefulness. According to TAM, attitude toward a system is jointly determined by usefulness and ease of use.\\nThe research model for this study is based on the TAM model while introducing several modifications, which are not in TAM. According to Davis (1989) complexity or the degree to which diffusion is perceived as being relatively difficult to use parallels perceived ease of use. However, other factors from diffusion theory such as compatibility and relative advantage have been dealt with too broadly and inconsistently as to be difficult of interpret (Tornatzky and Klein, 1982; Davis, 1989). Hence, based on the diffusion of innovations theory, three new constructs were introduced in place of perceived usefulness, namely perceived convenience, perceived costs/risks of adoption, and perceived observable benefits. The belief variables are the four user perceptions of PDA\\x92s: relative ease of use, perceived convenience, costs/risks, and observable benefits. These belief variables affect attitude towards technology in general, and these attitudes in turn affect behavioral intent (BI). BI is then considered a key determinant of actual usage. Based on this adaptation of TAM, key hypothesis are generated to predict the potential relationships between these determinants of PDA adoption. Since the study focuses only on these key factors, the external stimulus variables such as demographics, ownership of technology, and media use are controlled for.\\nData for the study has been collected using a CATI system with a representative sample of potential PDA consumers. The data was collected over 2 weeks of September 2002. Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that controlling for other factors, the attitude towards technology is determined by the perceived ease of use, and the potential costs or risks involved in adopting the innovation. BI is significantly predicted by attitude (A). The findings of the study would further the understanding of innovation decisions by helping marketers focus on key variables when promoting a new technology product.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDavis, F.D.

       "  'title': 'An Empirical Examination of Secondary Task Reaction Times: Testing What They Really Measure',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'This study tests a model of what secondary task reaction times (STRTs) actually measure as outlined in the STRT model proposed by Lang and Basil (1998). Lang and Basil\\x92s (1998) review of the STRT literature found that past literature referred to four theoretical definitions of what STRTs measure: resources required by a message; resources allocated to the message; resources available for processing; and resources remaining in the system. Indeed, they found that individual studies would often fluctuate between conceptualizations. The authors then integrated the limited capacity model of mediated message processing (for a complete discussion of the model, see Lang, 2000) with the four definitions, concluding that a conceptualization of STRTs as an index of available resources at encoding best fit the published STRT results.\\nSTRT methodology requires a subject in an experiment to perform a primary and secondary task at the same time, and it is assumed that the subject cannot concurrently use the same resources for the primary and secondary tasks. As primary tasks require more resources, there are fewer resources left over to conduct the secondary tasks, and STRTs slow down (Lang and Basil, 1998).\\nLang and Basil (1998) focused in particular on the counterintuitive results found for STRTs elicited during messages with high and low global video complexity and local video complexity. Theory seemed to predict that global video complex messages would elicit slower STRTs because more resources would be required to process them. But in fact, global video complex messages elicit faster STRTs than do simple video complex messages. Lang and Basil (1998) suggested the reason for this is that more resources are made available during complex messages. This means increasing global complexity leads to more resources being allocated to the message, thus increasing available resources. According to this view, global complexity determines the number of resources allocated to the attention task, and the content/structure of the message determines the number of resources required to process the message (Lang and Basil, 1998). Thus their model suggests that STRT is an indicator of available resources, specifically it indexes those resources made available to the cognitive subprocesses of encoding a message not needed to process the message. In other words, the structural features in globally complex messages elicit a large allocation of resources and the demands for resources made by the ongoing processing and storage of messages to encoding, but because many of those structural features do not require many resources to be processed, an over allocation of resources results (Lang and Basil, 1998, p. 458).\\nLang and Basil (1998) define available resources as the resources \\x93allocated to the message (which is increasing) minus the resources required by the message\\x94 (p. 460). If the resources required are less than the resources allocated, the available resources in global complex video messages may very well increase. Thus, there would be more resources available during complex messages compared to simple messages, and if this occurs as the reaction times will be faster during global video complex messages.\\nStudies investigating the effects of global and local video complexity suggest a way to directly test this model. Lang et al. (1999) found that cuts (i.e., change from one scene to an unrelated scene) in television programming automatically allocated resources to encoding. As the number of unrelated cuts increases, more attentional capacity is called to encoding. This resulted in a curvilinear effect on recognition (here an index of encoding) such that recognition improves from slow to medium-paced messages but decreases from medium to fast-paced messages, suggesting an overload.\\nConversely, Lang et al. (2000) predicted and found that increasing the number of edits defined as \\x93a change from one camera shot to another within the same visual scene\\x94 in a message would show an increase in recognition with no overload (p. 99). This is because the edit adds little new information to be processed, hence resources are allocated but are not needed to process the change.\\nThus it is logical to use the number of structural features to manipulate how many resources are allocated to encoding, and the type of structural feature (cut or edit) to manipulate how many resources are needed to process the structural feature. Therefore, fast-paced messages with many edits should leave more resources available than a fast-paced message with many cuts.\\nExamining the four conceptualizations of what STRTs measure outlined by Lang and Basil (1998), we see that a different pattern of STRT results is predicted for this design by each of the conceptualizations. If STRTs measure resources allocated to the message, then STRTs should slow down as the number of cuts and edits increases and there should be no difference between cuts and edits. If STRTs measure resources remaining in the system, there should again be fewer resources remaining for fast paced messages compared to slow, and if cuts require more resources there should be fewer resources remaining for cuts compared to edits. If STRTs measure resources required by the message, then STRTs should decrease as the number of cuts and edits increases with no difference for the type of structural feature. If STRTs measure resources available, then STRTs should speed up as both edits and cuts increase at a fast pace, and there should be a difference between cuts and edits.\\nThe current study was designed to empirically test this prediction. The design is a 3 (slow, medium, fast pacing) X 2 (edits, cuts) completely within design. STRT, recognition, cued recall, arousal, and attention will be dependent variables.\\nSAM (Self Assessment Mannequin) and skin conductance (SC) will be used to measure arousal. Heart rate will be gathered to measure attention. To measure recognition we will use four alternated multiple-choice tests, and storage will be measured using cued recall.\\nResources will be measured using STRTs. Subjects will watch the tapes (primary task) containing related edits and unrelated cuts. When they hear an audio tone they should push a button (secondary task).\\nTime line\\nStimulus materials already have been prepared. Subjects will be run in January and February.

       "  'abstract': 'By examining the Guerilla Girls\\' parody of a satirical movie poster entitled: \"The Birth of Feminism,\" my research question is how does parody function to exaggerate injustices that are normalized in the entertainment industry as it represents our patriarchal society as a whole? The Guerilla Girls, anonymous feminist art activists, have worked to change the perception held by detractors that feminists do not have a sense of humor. Through the use of parody, the Guerilla Girls have created a movie poster that directs attention to how the institution of Hollywood patronizes and demeans women by exploiting their physical looks and diminishing their accomplishments.\\nIn the paper, I analyze the Guerilla Girls satirical Hollywood movie poster using ideological criticism (Foss, 1996). This method of rhetorical criticism focuses on beliefs and values that are manifest in the artifact. Parody is effectively used in this artifact to make fun of the stereotypes that the movie industry perpetuates. The machinery of perspective by incongruity and the comic frame engenders a form of social criticism that seeks to correct the inadequacies of the present social order through demystification rather than revolution (Burke, 1964). bell hooks writes that \"the work of the Guerilla Girls represents a most powerful political union between theory and practice. They set an example for feminists everywhere\" (Guerilla Girls, 1999).',\n",

However, theories mapping the underlying psychological processes and effects of entertainment-education programs are borrowed and adapted from traditional persuasion theories and models of health belief changes. While a general \\x93trans-theory\\x94 of E-E effects may be useful in practice, no new theory of communication has been advanced, and questions about the uses of suspense, drama and humor, and receiver\\x92s reactions of sympathy, empathy and modeling, go unanswered. We propose integrating persuasion and behavior change theories with theories on mass media effects, specifically suspense, to propose a new model of E-E processes and outcomes. The advantages of the proposed model, over current practices in E-E theorizing, include more emphasis on heuristic processing and cultivation effects, a more active role of receiver\\x92s in accepting or rejecting emotional portrayals, and a separation of outcomes that are limited to mere attitude change effects, versus changes in both attitudes and behaviors.

A study was undertaken to investigate the effects of cultural values (collectivism), perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE), environmental attitudes on four types of proenvironmental behaviors: green-buying, energy-saving, recycling, and political behaviors. Structural equation modeling systematically tested and refined models representing interrelationships among the relevant variables. The results suggest that collectivistic value orientations have a direct effect on beliefs about self-efficacy in solving problems (PCE), which in turn influence environmental attitudes. However, the effects of PCE and attitudes on behaviors appeared to vary with the type of proenvironmental behaviors. That is, PCE exerts a direct effect on energy-saving and recycling behaviors and environmental attitudes have a direct effect on all behavioral measures except for recycling behaviors. Overall, the results indicate the importance of the relevant variables in predicting consumer proenvironmental behaviors. Although the value orientation was not found to have a direct effect on behaviors, it exerted indirect influences through PCE that subsequently influences environmental attitudes and behaviors.

Arguing over topics such as politics, a public issue argument, can be very different than arguing over topics such as cleaning the house, a personal issue argument. This study examines argument type as a situational constraint on argumentative and verbally aggressive behavior. Both men and women reported higher amounts of argumentative behavior in the public issue argument. Women reported higher amounts of verbally aggressive behavior in the personal issue argument, but men did not report significantly different levels of verbally aggressive behavior in either type of argument.

The women in this group were under constant threat of office closings and layoffs due to mergers, contract negotiations and strikes. Consequences the women suffered were emotional strain, isolation, fear and anger along with the chronic threat that material goods (a company pension) would be lost. The unique aspect of this study is that both the threat of job loss and its consequences were chronic in nature and the consequences are prevalent in the discursive practices shared by the women in this study.',\n",

These include the discovery of \\x93new\\x94 gratifications overlooked in the annals of mass communication research and the introduction of powerful new explanatory variables. However, much of the extant research has focused on college students populations, while the Internet has penetrated deeply into the general population. The present study extends previous research to more diverse populations and evaluates new explanatory variables within the framework of Bandura\\x92s (1986) Social Cognitive Theory. Respondents from two Midwestern states were contacted by mail to complete an on-line questionnaire. Among conventional Uses and Gratifications variables, expectations about participating in enjoyable activities online and expected social outcomes explained 23 percent of the variance in Internet usage. Habit strength, deficient self-regulation and Internet self efficacy combined in a stepwise multiple regression model that explained 40 percent of the variance in usage, in a model in which conventional Uses and Gratifications variables were not significant predictors. A new model of media attendance was proposed in which active consideration of uses and gratifications give way to habitual behavior and deficient self-regulation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'By analyzing data from surveys of journalists and journalism students in China, this paper shows that China\\x92s media reforms coupled with media globalization have made possible for the paradigm of professional journalism to emerge as a direct competitor to the Party-journalism paradigm. While the former gets manifested in journalists\\x92 positive appraisal of the elite western media outlets, the latter is related to praising the official Party organs. Further, the paradigm of professional journalism is related to an emphasis on the disseminator role of the media and the desire for more liberal arts training in journalism, the Party-journalism paradigm is related to an emphasis on the interpretive and popular advocacy roles as well as the desire for more training in Party propaganda and the official journalistic theories. The distinction between the two paradigms has significant implications to how China\\x92s journalists evaluate different innovative media outlets that have emerged during the reforms. In addition, more positive appraisals of exemplars of the professional journalism are related to higher levels of education, more frequent exposure to foreign media, fewer years working under the Party-media system, and holding no administrative positions in media organizations. Theoretical significance of these findings in relation to the concepts such as journalistic paradigm, journalist professionalism, and globalization is discussed.',\n",

The influence of Spanish mass media and level of language group identity is also assessed. A structural equation model summarizing the relationships between these factors is proposed. The final SEM indicates that English-only policies are one form of social limitation.

Content analysis of television coverage of presidential debates during the Mexican election in 2000 showed that first-level and second-level agenda setting theory explains the role that the media played during that contest. Coverage of the two presidential debates was illustrative of how effective the media were in setting the agenda for discussion on issues and candidate attributes during the campaign. Videotapes of television newscats were content analyzed, as were the television debates themselves. The study replicated findings of prior studies of the agenda-setting function: the media (television news) agenda prior to the debates was highly correlated with the content of the debates themselves.Data from a panel study conducted at the time of the campaign showed a high correspondence between media content and public perceptions of issues and candidate traits. This correspondence was more evident when analyzing candidate image. Overall media coverage was centered on candidate image rather than issues; consequently, the public perceptions of candidates were also centered on image attributes rather than campaign issues.',\n",

Studies examining the impact of television, telephone and the Internet are examined and critiqued.

According to the model, there are five basic dimensions to any communication technology: interactivity, directionality, mode, latency and capacity. The paper also proposes a reconceptualization of the social capital construct and introduces a network model of social capital for the information era. The models are then discussed in relation to a new communication policy initiative by the Aspen Institute that uses technical layers of a communication system as bases for regulatory action in the age of media convergence and transition to an IP environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper aspires to provide an empirically informed exploration of the Net\\x92s use for political purposes. The substantive focus is on the political debate on immigration and asylum in the United Kingdom, and the empirical analysis is concerned with activist organisations supporting immigrants and asylum seekers. By way of looking at the websites of 45 NGOs concerned with asylum and immigration in the UK, the paper asks the following questions: Whom do these websites address? What type of information do they provide? Through focusing on the issues of addressees, and communicative forms, the paper attempts to draw some tentative conclusions regarding some of the political uses to which the Internet is put. The findings indicate that, digital divide arguments notwithstanding, the internet is proving to be an important resource for activist organisations in enabling them to accomplish several things at the same time: they provide practical and legal information to potential immigrants and asylum seekers, they attempt to influence the political and legal framework through addressing both government and citizenry, and they invite citizens to understand the issues involved in asylum and to actively engage in helping refugees. The instrumentality involved in this usage, however, is problematic from the point of view of normative models of the public sphere, which focus on dialogue and deliberation. In conclusion, it is argued that incorporating the Internet as part of the public sphere may entail an expansion of the latter to include instrumental communication',\n",

From a communication perspective, a critical concern is how people respond when they are hurt. One factor that may impact how people react is their level of relational satisfaction. Additionally, the perceived intent underlying hurt-evoking comments can shape recipients\\x92 communicative responses. This study investigated whether senders and receivers perceive hurtful communication differently with regard to intentionality and relational satisfaction, and how attributions of intentionality and perceptions of relational satisfaction affect recipients\\x92 communicative responses to those messages. Although no differences between senders and receivers were revealed for perceived intentionality or relational satisfaction, these factors did impact how people responded to hurtful communication in their families. When comments were perceived as intentionally hurtful, people had a tendency to respond to negative communication with more negative communication. In contrast, hurt-evoking comments that were viewed as unintentional were met with productive/integrative communication. Likewise, relational satisfaction influenced communicative responses, such that dissatisfied individuals responded with negative communication; whereas satisfied individuals were more likely to calmly discuss their feelings. The findings of the current project shed light on how families interpret and grapple with hurtful communication.',\n",

Relying on the theories of sign production, I argue that the three auditory interfaces would require different levels of mental efforts for interpretation: verbal messages are easiest to interpret, followed by earcons and auditory icons. The implication is that verbal messages would offer the highest usability among the three auditory interfaces.',\n",

The releases were compared to 47 published accounts of the unfolding financial crises to determine whether the organizational messages remained intact. The findings show no dominant communication strategy in either company. Both professed openness but engaged in blame shifting. The combined message strategy suggests cooperation between legal and public relations counsel. The messages of both organizations were successfully transmitted via the mass media but were tempered by solid reporting.

The concept was first introduced in the U.S. academic community by Molleda and Connolly-Ahern at the 2002 AEJMC convention. The authors drew this theoretical concept from German scholars Welge and Holtbrügge (1998, 2001) and Berg and Holtbrügge (2001). The development of this international public relations working theory is achieved by summarizing six cases involving issues that have affected more than one country and several parties, such as transnational businesses, NGOs, host governments, and global and national media outlets. Cross-national conflict shifting includes host, home and transnational publics, which indicates the complexity and magnitude of the interactions among the players. Ten propositions are introduced to build the theoretical foundation for future qualitative and quantitative studies. The working theory shows the complexity of managing issues conflicts as they acquire transnational status.',\n",

By reducing these media to a communitarian logic of bonding, we are failing to understand their instrumental role in helping redefine and challenge the identity and boundaries of a diasporic community. Diasporas are by definition re-imagined communities, constructed around multiple narratives and discourses. Their survival depends to a large extent on their ability to provide a space for conflicting claims of belonging and their willingness to reconcile those differences.\\nIn my research, I focus on radio MultiKulti, a public station targeting Germans and all ethnic minorities in Berlin, and Beur FM, a private station targeting only North Africans both in Paris and a few major French cities. Radio MultiKulti was first created as a public-service reaction following a mounting wave of xenophobia and violent attacks against foreigners in the Branderburg federal state, of which Berlin is the capital. One of its main concerns is to educate the German public and minorities on the benefits of a multicultural society while preserving the cultural identity of foreigners. In contrast with this top-down approach to minority broadcasting, Beur FM, founded and run by North Africans themselves, started as a grassroot reaction to years of marginalization, racism, and misrepresentation in French mainstream media. Its mission is rather particularistic, but one of its goals is to facilitate the integration of its listeners into French society and help them reconcile the cultural contradictions they experience in that society.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This research explores the relationship between Internet use and gratifications gained within the context of digital divide. Analyses within sub-samples defined by age and socio-economic status reveal that there are notable differences across the subcategories. For instance, those that are young and high in socioeconomic status are most likely to use the Internet to strategically satisfy their motivations and gain the desired gratifications. They are most likely to engage in specific Internet behaviors \\x97 computer-mediated interaction, surveillance, and consumption uses \\x97 to achieve particular gratifications \\x97 connection, learning, and acquisition, respectively. In contrast, respondents who were low in socio-economic status and young were particularly likely to employ consumptive use of the Internet to attain connection gratifications. Similarly, both low socioeconomic status subgroups, regardless of age, were likely to use computer-mediated interaction as a means to gain learning gratifications. We concluded that even if gaps in access are closing, gaps in usage and gratifications gained may persist. Further implications for digital divide will be discussed.',\n",

The introduction of the new currency has diverse implications for the people in each of the 12 countries, both at national and Eurozone levels. Therefore, this change provides an exciting opportunity to test the agenda-setting hypothesis. Data for the study come from the major newspaper in France, the country that initiated the switch to euro, and public opinion polls conducted by Gallup Europe. A total of 298 paragraphs from 72 articles are analyzed to examine second-level agenda-setting effects on substantive and affective attributes of the euro. Findings suggest that affective attributes relating to national implications of the euro are subject to agenda-setting effects, while the ones relating to the entire Eurozone are not. Also, the French media agenda appears to be correlated with the Eurozone public agenda.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper explores some theoretical openings that can contribute to a rethinking of identity and the global/local nexus beyond the binary restrictions imposed by pervasive modernist presuppositions in contemporary globalization theory. It attempts to offer alternative paths to the binary logic underpinning much of the present theorizing of global/local relations and identity formation. In this context, I suggest three interrelated logics: relationality and singularity, mutual implication and incommensurability, contingency and embodiment. I argue that it is within the continuous oscillation and mutual specification between the global (the universal) and the local (the particular) where the process of identity formation (individual or collective) becomes intelligible and possible to be reimagined. Identity emerges more as a field of relationality than as an essence; no longer a metaphysical or fixed reality (autonomously created or imposed from the outside) but a dynamic process defined simultaneously by the possibilities and constraints present in the field of relations that constitute, contingently, our sense and practice of \\x93being\\x94, which, as I argue, is always (and should be more properly understood as) a becoming. From this perspective, I am interested in looking at the interface between the global and the local, the relational space where identity is articulated and mobilized, and also in exploring some implications of this process for thinking in new possibilities of theoretical and political practice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper analyzes newspaper diversity programs from the viewpoint of journalists identified with communities of color. In interviews at four large-circulation newspapers serving communities of color, the authors found a pattern of recurring critical issues facing the journalists in their efforts to diversify the news. These issues included connecting with previously neglected communities, changing newsroom practices (including hiring, promotion, and training), and getting journalists of color in gatekeeper positions. These interviews also revealed that journalists of color (and some female journalists) often described a borderland existence and consciousness. Because they identified with communities of color and with the newspaper, they often had to reconcile differences and mediate the two distinct cultures. One source of frustration for these \"borderland journalists\" was the realization that their newspapers generally still operate under diversity paradigms that measure success in diversity in terms of employment statistics marketing imperatives, rather than redefining news and changing newsroom routines.',\n",

The researcher views the conventional public relations practices in Thailand as simply following Western paradigms, often found unfit in the Thai contexts. The alternative model is reconceptualized within the Buddhism-based buranagarn framework, which embraces the understanding of complexity, plurality, interrelatedness, and interdependence of social reality. In an attempt to examine the interplay of the Buddhism-based buranagarn framework and the Western qualitative perspective, the term \\x93relational integration\\x94 is introduced. Within the relational integration framework, this study integrates the Buddhist way of thinking into the critical public relations theory and research, and coins this new concept as \\x93Buddhist public relations.\\x94\\nThrough the integrated research method of critical-qualitative ethnography and collaborative action research, the researcher develops the experiential knowledge of public relations as community-building and co-operative learning process for community-based organizations from the particular locales in Bangkok metropolitan and the North-East region of Thailand. It is found that to facilitate the Buddhist public relations for community-based organizations, three major approaches needs to be taken into consideration: 1) Building Buddhist values as moral and spiritual groundwork; 2) Developing dialectic dialogue through community culture and social relationships; and 3) Facilitating community interaction.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Much of our population views intercultural relationships as negative, however many practical reasons exist for building and sustaining intercultural relations. Intercultural relationships of nearly every type have been recognized as unacceptable, abnormal, and \"mixed up\" throughout long stretches of history in the United States and around the world. It was not until 1967 in the United States that the Supreme Court nullified laws against interracial marriage (Loving v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 1967). Our past conceptions, ideals, and laws have created strong attitudes towards how the majority of people perceive intercultural relationships. Research shows that both men and women hold negative attitudes toward interracial relationships (Mills & Daly, 1995).\\nThrough building and sustaining relationships with others from different cultures and races, we can acquire knowledge about the world, break stereotypes, and acquire new skills (Martin & Nakayama 1999). The diversity that is created by an intercultural relationship allows for increased creativity and improved problem solving (Cox & Blake 1991). Although many advantages of having intercultural relationships have been demonstrated through years of research, many attitudes of anti-interracial relationships continue to exist. This analysis will (1) synthesize research of peoples? perceptions of intercultural relationships, (2) discuss reasons why people perceive intercultural relationships as either negative or positive, (3) and discuss reasons why building and sustaining intercultural relationships have practical and positive benefits. Two main contexts among intercultural relationships are discussed: friendships and romantic relationships. Research in the areas of friendship selection, interracial/intercultural friendship, interracial/intercultural acceptance, interracial/intercultural contact, interracial dating, interracial marriage, and intercultural communication was reviewed. Suggestions for further research are made as well as commentary on the future of intercultural relationships.',\n",

For partisan bias to end, newsrooms must be controlled by people dedicated to political pluralism in the news, but those newsrooms can be constructed within either the state or the private sector just as they can both be captured by partisan interests.

       "  'abstract': 'This paper is an ethnographic study of the questioning discourse in Chinese criminal trials. Questioning in Chinese criminal courts takes on culture-specific forms and plays culture-specific functions. Situated in the Chinese cultural context, questioning is used to perform double culture-specific functions: to persuade defendants to confess in court and to educate the public and prevent crimes through its punitive force. The following patterns of questioning were rhetorically used to help the court achieve its persuasive goals: a) repeating key questions b) invalidating excuses or accounts c) asking unanswerable questions d) supplying answers and e) paraphrasing or restating defendants~{!/~} responses. Through evoking and enacting Chinese cultural values and norms, these patterns of questioning gain persuasive power and render questioning in Chinese criminal trials an interlocking process of accusing, invalidating, and shaming defendants with the goal of persuasion. After a brief literature review and a discussion of data collection and analysis methods, the paper describes in detail patterns of questioning in Chinese criminal trials that are used to obtain confession and remorse from defendants. Finally the deterrent function of the questioning discourse in Chinese cultural context is discussed.',\n",

Captive audiences are listeners unable to control and shield themselves from abusive communication either because of their location, their social identity, or the aggressive nature of the message. Our analysis discloses that, in defining captivity, judges employ assumptions about the nature of space, the nature of advertising mediums, the availability of market-created \\x93opt-out\\x94 mechanisms, and the ability of the listeners to make claims based on legally acceptable definitions of social identity. Our analysis suggests that the courts of law may have actually contributed to the disproportionate increase in corporate power over individual privacy rights.',\n",

From the 1930s until his death in 1956 Rivero\\x92s characters embodied \\x91Caribbean\\x92 mediated \\x91blackness\\x92 and became ambivalent symbols of the oppressed sectors of the population. The author argues that Rivero\\x92s popularity as a blackface and \\x91black\\x92 voice performer operated within three intertwined discursive spaces: the translation of Cuba\\x92s Bufo theatre negrito catedrático type as a symbol of anti-colonialism and political satire, the actor\\x92s left-wing nationalist persona and social activism, the re-articulation of la gran familia puertorriqueña as a hegemonic discourse. The author suggests that after Rivero\\x92s death in 1956 subsequent televisual representations of Caribbean negritos during the 1950s and 1960s became racialized figures which reaffirmed the hegemonic \\x91whiteness\\x92 not only of the Puerto Rican nation, but also of the emerging post 1959 Cuban migrant community in Puerto Rico.',\n",

However, few studies have examined how and to what extent CEOs are portrayed in media coverage. This study builds on recent newspaper research on the topic. Content analysis of 577 articles in three leading magazines during the period 1990-2001 is used to analyze trends in salience and valence of CEO coverage and to assess five dimensions of CEO images in coverage.\\nFindings are similar to those in the newspaper study. Magazine coverage of CEOs rose dramatically during the period, and overall valence of the articles was favorable.

This work in progress focuses on women's use of spirituality to help negotiate these personal borderlands. We wish to explore women's changing spiritual identities during such times of transition. Based on previous research, we contend that the communicative negotiation and management of transitions as reflected in changing understandings of spiritual identity can be seen in a woman's negotiation of social identities in flux as well as the resilience provided by more enduring intrapersonal identities. We believe that we can gain understanding into this phenomenon by observing communicative behaviors associated with it.

For example, Media Richness Theory attempts to postulate these differences in terms of richness or leanness; a channel\\x92s richness or leanness is determined by the amount of deliverable cues, feedback, language variety, personal focus and shared understanding that a channel is able to deliver. Channel Expansion theory, however, accounts for experiential factors that directly influence the perceived richness of a particular channel of communication. In the current study, the researchers solicited participation from 159 undergraduates at a small, liberal arts university on the east coast. Participants were asked to complete a survey concerning the primary medium of communication of an organization of which they were currently a member. These data indicate direct evidence to support the claim that the more the experience a group has with a channel the more they perceive it to be rich. Therefore, experiential knowledge can have a positive influence on perceived media richness, causing a necessary revaluation of the media richness theory, and its assumed hierarchy of media.',\n",

This study uses a statewide survey data of Ohio residents to look at the web sites people visit mostly frequently for news and information and to explore the relationship of Internet use and traditional media use. Results show that traditional print and broadcasting media web sites are as popular as the general and specialized information web sites. In terms of content, most of the news and information in those web sites duplicates what's already in the traditional newspapers and TV programs. In terms of structure, the web does have its advantages over traditional media. Newspaper users use general information web sites quite a lot to get supplementary information.

       "  'abstract': \"This article presents a paradigm of process evaluation of intergroup contact interventions and applies it to investigate encounters between Jews and Arabs in Israel. This is done in two steps: (1) classifying intergroup encounters in terms of their goals and underlying ideology. (2) Defining and applying criteria that would enable to evaluate the quality of intergroup interaction in such interventions, focusing on the criterion of symmetry between the Jews and Arabs in active participation in the encounter. The research population includes some 47 programs of encounters between Jews and Arabs conducted in Israel in the years 1999/?2000.The analyzed data includes interviews with program staff and participants, documents related to the encounters and of observations of encounter meetings and ratings of the interactions within them. The classification of encounter programs in terms of their ideology identified two major approaches - those that emphasize coexistence and similarities between the sides and those that emphasize aspects of conflict, confrontation and asymmetry in power. Also a third category of 'mixed' models was identified that includes aspects of both the above approaches. The evaluation findings show that most programs studied here were symmetrical in terms of active participation of their participants in the encounter interaction, with no notable difference between the different ideological approaches. However, more than half of the encounters there was dominance of Jewish facilitators in leading the encounters. This dominance was less pronounced in encounters including confrontational elements then in non confrontational-coexistence ones.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper looks at the relationships between communication medium and perceived intentions on attributions between romantic couples during conflict communication. Fifty-seven couples were asked in an experiment to handle a conflict either FtF or via CMC, and were either told their partner had no choice, or their partner explicitly chose this communication medium. Participants\\x92 thoughts and attributions were analyzed for several aspects: target of the thought, valence of the thought, and types of attributions made. Overall, these data suggest that males prefer of CMC versus FtF conflict resolution. In particular, men will make more positive relational attributions, more positive partner attributions when their partners use CMC, and more negative internal attributions when FtF was utilized. Females do not prefer handling conflict FtF as well, given the extent of their internal negative partner related attributions. Females also had more positive thoughts when they perceived their partner chose to use CMC.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Cognitive and Emotional Correlates of Social Comparison and Cognitive Dissonance During Exposure to TV Ads',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"One often quoted criticism of advertising concerns the perceived effects of portrayals of super thin women on body satisfaction among young women (Posavac, Posavac & Weigel, 2001). The impact of advertising models on women's body satisfaction leads to greater concern due to the link between body satisfaction, self-esteem and eating disorders (Cash, 1990; Irving, 1990). Indeed, researchers have linked viewing super thin models in appearance related advertisements to increased dissatisfaction with one's own body (Harrison & Cantor, 1997; Heinberg & Thompson, 1995; Myers & Biocca, 1992). Researchers believe that processes of social comparison and cognitive dissonance are behind the effects of super thin advertising models on body satisfaction (Martin & Kennedy, 1993; Richins, 1991). The idea is that during exposure, women compare themselves to models in the advertisement and when they do not measure up, experience cognitive dissonance, which results in lower satisfaction with their own body. The purpose of this study is to probe deeper into the processes of social comparison and cognitive dissonance by exploring the cognitive and emotional processes engaged in young women during exposure to appearance related television advertisements. More specifically, this study seeks to isolate cognitive and emotional correlates of social comparison and cognitive dissonance.\\nSocial comparison evoked by a television advertisement involves processing information presented in the message and activating information stored in long-term memory concerning self-appearance (Hargreaves & Tiggemann, 2002). During exposure to television advertisements attention or cognitive resources are allocated externally to the message to encode it into short-term memory (Lang, 2000). When the message encourages viewers to engage in social comparison an increase in cognitive resources allocated internally to activating information stored in long-term memory should be needed. Previous research has tried to document the occurrence of social comparison through thought listing techniques after exposure to advertisements (Hargreaves & Tiggemann, 2002). However, an increase in allocating cognitive resources internally retrieval of long-term memory could be a cognitive correlate of social comparison and can be measured during exposure to advertisements. According to Lang (1995), heart rate speeds up during an increase in cognitive resources to internal mental activities. Social comparison should occur during appearance related advertisements featuring super-thin models but not during non-appearance related advertisements. This leads to the following hypothesis:\\nH1: Heart rate will be faster during exposure to appearance related television advertisements compared to non-appearance related advertisements.\\nCognitive dissonance has been defined as a negative emotional state resulting from not measuring up to an ideal standard (Richins, 1991). Researchers have yet to document the emotional state associated with cognitive dissonance experienced during exposure to television advertisements featuring super thin models. However, by definition, cognitive dissonance should be correlated with an increase in negative emotional valence and arousal. Previous research has demonstrated that skin conductance and facial EMG, specifically Corrugator muscle activity, can be used to index arousal and negative emotional valence (Dawson, Schell & Filion, 1990; Eckman, 1993). Women who have lower state body satisfaction should experience greater cognitive dissonance than women with higher body satisfaction. Thus,\\nH2: Skin conductance and Corrugator muscle activity will be greater during exposure to appearance related television advertisements for women with lower body satisfaction compared to women with higher body satisfaction.\\nMethodology\\nIndependent Variables\\nSocial comparison is conceptually defined as the act of comparing one's self to a desirable target. Social comparison will be manipulated by presenting participants with appearance and non-appearance related television advertisements. Appearance related advertisements feature appearance related products and have desirable female models in them that represent society's thin ideal. These ads will emphasize the appearance of the model as being desirable. Non-appearance related advertisements will be for products that are not related to physical appearance and will not feature super-thin female models.\\nCognitive dissonance is conceptualized as a state that results from failing to measure up to an ideal standard. Cognitive dissonance will be manipulated by comparing women who have low state body satisfaction to women who have high state body satisfaction.\\nDependent Variables\\nAttention is conceptually defined as cognitive resources that are invested in information processing. Attention will be measured by obtaining participants' heart rate. Heart rate will be measured for a five-second baseline prior to exposure to each advertisement and time-locked to exposure to the advertisements.\\nArousal is conceptually defined as a dimension of emotion that reflects how calm or excited a person feels. Arousal will be measured based on levels of skin conductance. Skin conductance will be measured for a five-second baseline prior to exposure to each advertisement and time-locked to exposure to the advertisements.\\nEmotional valence is conceptually defined as a dimension of emotion related to how positive or negative a person feels. Emotional valence will be measured by facial EMG. Specifically, this study is interested in the experience of negative emotional valence so Corrugator muscle activity will be measured. Corrugator activity will also be measured for a five-second baseline prior to exposure to each advertisement and time-locked to exposure to the advertisements.\\nDesign\\nThe design of this experiment is a 2 (Social Comparison) X 2 (Cognitive Dissonance) X 3 (Order) mixed model. Social comparison is a within subjects variable. All participants will see the appearance-related (social comparison) and non-appearance related (no social comparison) advertisements. Cognitive dissonance is a between subjects variable having to do with whether participants have high or low state body satisfaction. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three stimulus tape orders.\\nStimuli\\nStimulus messages will be three appearance related and three non-appearance related 60-second television advertisements taped off-air. Taping will be done during programs for which college women are in the target demographic. Stimulus messages will be pre-tested to assure they result in equivalent levels of message involvement during exposure. Stimulus messages will be edited into three random orders.\\nParticipants and Procedure\\nPrior to the experiment a survey measuring body satisfaction will be administered to 200 college women enrolled in communication courses. Forty women with very high and forty women with very low body satisfaction will be contacted to participate in the experiment. Participants will complete the experiment one at a time in a psychophysiology lab. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The researcher will prep participants for collection of physiological data and then will give instructions for completing self-report measures. Self-report measures will include message involvement, social comparison and cognitive dissonance. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions and then will be shown the advertisements. Participants will complete self-report measures in between each advertisement. After completing self-report measures for the last advertisement, participants will be thanked and dismissed.\\nTime Table\\nData collection for this experiment will be completed in March. Data analysis will be completed in April.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCash, T.F. (1990). The Psychology of Physical Appearance: Aesthetics, attributes and images. In T. Cash and T.

Both television visual and audio features are considered. The main visual techniques which received much interest in literature are the use of pictures/videos, emotional/negative pictures, editing pace, number of edits, redundancy, camera angles, graphics, color versus black and white images, and still versus motion pictures. In addition, studies have examined the emotional and cognitive effects of audio techniques such as narration style, music, silence, and sound effects. The literature included some contradictory results regarding the cognitive and emotional effects of these structural features. The paper presents some possible explanation for some of these contradicting results. Suggestions for future research are discussed.',\n",

We conducted interviews with college students (n = 503) as a specifically at-risk population. We asked about their health histories, experiences with information seeking, and impressions of source effectiveness and ineffectiveness. Participants' responses were quantified using multiple, independent coders producing eight major categories and 40 subcategories of information sources and 12 factors of source effectiveness or ineffectiveness. Participants most often reported perceiving information as available in the print, electronic, and professional major sources categories, and doctors/physicians, the Internet, and friends source subcategories. Of all the major categories, participants reported that they would most likely consult the health care worker and family major categories, and the doctor/physician, parents, and nurse subcategories. Similarly, participants reported actually using the health care worker, electronic and print media major categories, and the doctor/physician, the Internet, and friends subcategories, rating the health care worker and educational major source categories and the doctor/physician, nurse, and parent subcategories as relatively more effective. Credibility and relevance emerged as most frequently reported as important for evaluating a source as effective or ineffective. Analyses of the relationship between gender, class standing, and experience with a serious illness are also presented. Implications of the findings for professionals working with college student populations and scholars studying information seeking are discussed.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Context: Mass media based entertainment education messages improve family planning behavior. It is likely that audience participation in the form of listening groups may enhance the impact of these programs. In Fulbari (Nepal), a partnership between local government agencies, community leaders, audience members, and program staff led to the launch of listening groups complementing a mass media family planning initiative.\\nMethods: The impact of membership in these listening groups was assessed through a case-control study design using survey data, supplemented by anecdotal evidence and service statistics.\\nResults: Among 408 respondents to the survey, 50% were members of listening groups, 18% were exposed to the radio program only, while 32 0x1.e115d00000001p-895d no exposure to radio program or listeners groups. Multivariate logistic regression models show significant impact of listenership on knowledge and behavior variables. For instance, with exposure to radio programs only, respondents were 3.5 times more likely to recall 5 modern methods of contraception. However with membership in listening groups, they were over 8 times more likely to recall these methods. Compared to nonmembers, listening group members were more likely to use modern methods of contraception.\\nConclusions: Exposure to radio programs alone is associated with improved family planning knowledge and behavior. Membership in listening groups has a positive impact on family planning outcomes above and beyond the effects of exposure to the same radio program. Results affirm the importance of a partnership between program organizers, community leaders, NGO-partners and the audience community in order to generate positive family planning outcomes.',\n",

The purpose of the study it to determine whether negatively or positively framed messages regarding skin cancer detection and prevention will lead to more favorable attitudes and greater intentions to follow recommended behavior. College students were exposed to one of the following: a positively framed prevention message, a positively framed detection message, a negatively framed prevention message, or a negatively framed detection message. Inconsistent with predictions, negatively framed messages were not found to be more persuasive when dealing with a detection behavior and positively framed messages were not found to be more persuasive when dealing with a prevention behavior. Results of this study show a significant relationship between intent to perform a skin exam and message frame.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pornography is, ultimately, only defined by the culture in which it is found. It tests the limits of what a society deems obscene. In this regard, pornographers must constantly face gatekeepers, which regulate the dissemination of their product. It has been said that when a new communication technology emerges, pornographers will be the first to utilize it. It will be shown that, because of societal gatekeepers, pornography perpetuates technological evolution. Pornography\\x92s uses of new technologies and media fall into the media ecological paradigm of unintended consequences. Pornographers take advantage of these new media as a response to the inadequacies of current communication technology. From this perspective, the following article will explore the conceptualization of the pornographic and its role in the evolution of technology. From the birth of the printed word to the digital age, pornography\\x92s presence has been hard to deny, but by looking at its progression via its media channel, the reason for its ubiquity will become apparent.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Findings from the impact evaluation of a Democracy and Governance intervention in Nigeria indicate that project activities are associated with more favorable ideation about political participation and improved democratic participation. There appears to be a dose-response relationship between the intervention and pertinent indicators of political participation. Specifically, higher levels of program exposure are associated with more favorable ideation about political participation, and higher likelihood of participating in the political process. The data also indicate that the ideation model is very relevant in explaining voting behavior but not so much so for party membership. For voting, the ideational variables that are most significant are perceptions about the views of others on women's political participation, and the readiness of women to vote for a candidate or join a political party different from their husbands' or partners' when there is a difference of opinion between the two. For predicting party membership, the only significant ideational variable is discussion of political views. One surprising finding from the analyses presented in this paper is that perceived response efficacy of voting is not associated with increased political participation. The results of the study indicate that D&G communication interventions would be more effective if they addressed community norms about the political participation of women and sought to empower women to be able to make personal political decisions.\",\n",

Relationships inevitably separated by military obligations, job relocations, prison marriages, and long-distance relationships among college students have been previously studied, although not thoroughly. Long-distance romantic relationships are often maintained by relying heavily upon the availability and popular use of communication technologies. By conducting focus groups, this paper sought to understand how college students in long-distance romantic relationships use communication technologies to regularly maintain their relationship and manage conflicts that inevitably ensue. It was hypothesized that telephone and instant messaging will be the most prevalent types of communication technology used on a daily basis among individuals in long-distance relationships, as opposed to other forms of communication. It is hoped that the results of this study increase understanding of how the emergence of new communication technologies, such as video-conferencing, might benefit (or perhaps not) the successful maintenance of long-distance romantic relationships.',\n",

By viewing the implementation of systems philosophy through the concepts of bona fide groups and emergent social networks reacting to punctuated equilibrium conditions, we see how organizations react and adapt to challenges and crisis. This paper highlights the case of Cornell University\\x92s Formula SAE team as a best practices example of an engineering group that navigates such challenges effectively.',\n",

Although treatment programs attempt to normalize clients\\x92 self-disclosures, many clients fear and avoid revealing their weaknesses. Thus, the group therapy setting is ripe for defensiveness. Although previous research has focused on the causes of defensiveness (Gibb, 1961; Stamp et al., 1992), research has overlooked the communicative strategies that people use to manage and mitigate defensiveness in social interaction. This study used ethnographic methods to illuminate the communicative strategies that female substance abuse clients at the Women\\x92s Program (WP), a program of the Community Services Center (CSC), used to deal with their experiences of defensiveness. The clients resourcefully used an array of strategies, which were identified and defined within the social context of the WP group therapy setting.',\n",

Past research has shown that the application of the protest paradigm varies according to the nature of the group\\'s goals. Adherence to the protest paradigm may also vary in response to the characteristics of the community in which media messages are produced. The structural pluralism research of Tichenor, Donohue and Olien suggests that community structure can affect news coverage of social conflict, which might be extended to include adherence to the protest paradigm, as smaller, homogenous communities exhibit less tolerance for social conflict than larger, heterogeneous communities. This research analyzes content of protest articles, comparing coverage in large, mid-sized and small daily newspapers, and weekly newspapers. Results show smaller daily newspapers avoided or minimized protest stories, while large newspapers depicted more radical protest goals, were less critical of protests targeting local governments and quoted protesters more often.',\n",

Male heavy users of CMC had lower degrees of loneliness, and male infrequent users of CMC had higher degrees of loneliness. Females showed no significant difference. The results of this study imply that for males the use of CMC may not be related to perceived loneliness, but a tool to facilitate their communication and relationships with others.

       "  'abstract': 'During the design, development, and diffusion of an information and communication technology (ICT) a social process takes place that has been called ?configuring the user.? This process involves making both explicit and implicit assumptions about how actors will accept, reject, or modify the technology. Similarly, academic or scientific studies of ICTs vary according to the social identity ascribed to actors. Three conceptions that are commonly employed in studies to refer to actors in relationship to ICTs are user, consumer, and community member. In this article, an exploration of the consequences of the naming of actors is carried out for three representative studies of ICTs. It is argued that the choice of the term user, consumer, or community member is associated with the range and type of opportunities for action opened up for actors in relation to ICTs.',\n",

It aims to demonstrate how newspapers in different countries framed the bombing event in different ways. The study finds that different political ideology and press ideology interact to frame news discourse. Embracing liberal democracy ideology and justifying the Kosovo War, the US press framed the bombing as an accident due to technical mistakes. Upholding official socialist ideology and considering the Kosovo War as a wanton invasion toward a sovereign country, the Chinese press framed the bombing as an extension of such invasion and a deliberate attack on China. Taiwan press shared similar stance with the US in terms of political ideology and the interpretation of the bombing, but showed more neutral attitude in terms of the tone of coverage. The study concludes that framing is an important mechanism by which ideology is transmitted through the news.\",\n",

To this end, the paper presents a discursive analysis of publications of the Association for the Polish Commonwealth established in 1990 to cultivate relations between Poland and its diaspora. The paper extends the framework of constitutive rhetoric by exploring transnational discourse flowing across borders. The analysis identifies a flexible subject as an ideological effect of constitutive discourse that aims to legitimate a diasporic form of collective engagement with the homeland across borders and from a position of national membership in another nation-state. This form of discourse enables the nation-state to reinforce its position and extend its influence beyond its political borders. The concept of flexibility directs attention to how identities and cultural meanings are negotiated and produced across borders.',\n",

The present study aims at exploring the social implications of people¡¯s active participation in avatar marketing, asking what would be the motivational bases of such behaviors.

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"Diasporic communication has always occurred across and despite borders. The case of the Turkish minority in Greece, a beached diaspora and vestige of the Ottoman past, is a peculiar case where the tensions of transnationalism and nationalism intersect and where boundaries are continuously created and negotiated. In order to understand communication in this politicised environment and the relationship between media and identity I draw on an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that understands identities as performed and as experienced. The paper, based on interviews with, and participant observation among Turkish speakers living in Athens, examines people's media resources, national and transnational. The uses of media and their integration in people's daily lives is a complex process involving a number of parameters, material, social and individual often extending beyond ethnicity. However, it is argued that although media do not determine identities, they do contribute in creating symbolic communicative spaces that either include or exclude, thereby affecting audiences' discourses about their identities. In interpreting such processes I draw on Barth's theory of Ethnic Groups and Boundaries (1969) to argue that the media, through a number of practices, often create boundaries for inclusion and exclusion, and eventually participation in a 'common culture'. The first part of the paper highlights two themes: the first is that gender and generational differences contest the idea of a homogenous Turkish minority suggesting the importance of social change; the second is that media consumption in Turkish households is banal, shaped by social rather than ethnic parameters. In the second part of the paper, however, the banal consumption of media is disrupted by instances when tension prevails. Three such cases are discussed as examples of media raising the boundaries for exclusion from a common communicative space.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Talk radio has been a rising phenomenon in Hong Kong since the mid-1990s. Understanding such a phenomenon, however, requires efforts in contextualizing the talk shows into the larger political communication process and the social and political conditions of the city. The present paper represents such an attempt to contextualize talk radio in Hong Kong. While recognizing the rise of the politics of public opinion, the existence of social and economic crises, and the problematic performance of mainstream media as potentially important factors contributing to the prominence of talk radio, the study analyzes a comparative survey on citizens' and journalists' view on media and politics in Hong Kong in order to examine how the two groups of people conceive of the phenomenon. The results show that journalists and citizens focus on different aspects of talk radio. Journalists emphasize upon talk radio as a site for citizens to express their discontent and anguish, a site for official-citizen conflicts, and thus a site on which government officials can be monitored, citizens tend to see talk radio as an alternative channel for political communication and they emphasize on monitoring government officials as well as on other more constructive aspects of public discussion. The implications of the findings on understanding talk radio in Hong Kong, as well as on understanding the relationship between new and old media of political communication in general, are discussed.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper, I explore the knowledge dynamics underlying the contingent worker-firm relationship from a knowledge-creation perspective, focusing on highly skilled contingent workers in knowledge-based firms in dynamic environments. Building on Matusik and Hill\\x92s management model for contingent work, Bird\\x92s view of boundaryless careers as knowledge creators, and the knowledge-creating theory of the firm, I explore the knowledge-creating and knowledge-acquiring processes for contingent workers, and argue for potential knowledge benefits for contingent workers as an integral part of the knowledge dynamics constituting the contingent worker-firm relationship. I further propose a new conceptualization of the contingent worker-firm relationship as a potential knowledge-creation partnership that acknowledges the possibility of intrinsically motivated contingent workers. Drawing on the organization trust literature, the knowledge transfer literature, and the contingent work literature, I also examine the understudied trust and distrust dynamics constituting the contingent worker-firm relationship. The analysis sheds some light into the complex trust relationships between contingent workers and the firm, and that between contingent workers and traditional workers, and explicates the critical role of trust in facilitating the achievement of the goal of knowledge creation and transfer.',\n",

Using an extreme example of talk-in-interaction in a European Assembly, this paper introduces the possibility that we may look differently at conversation. Proceeding within the theoretical framework of Interlocutionary Logic, this work proposes an analytic framework which makes it possible to explore chaos-in-conversation and to uncover some of its constitutive features. The conversations appear as a heap of units with a particularly complex configuration that does not conform to the classical structures of linguistic exchanges and communicative dynamics. The communicative interaction in this setting constitutes a process which is not directly translatable into ordered sequences of relevant elements. To the contrary, it achieves its goal in a chaotic way that can be articulated around multiple structures developing in parallel.',\n",

This leaves an enormous amount of power in the hands of mediators. Child custody mediation, as a coercive state practice, can be problematic and its consequences significant.

       "  'abstract': 'The vision of a dynamic and intelligent Celestial Jukebox, in which any cultural artifact will be available via broadband channels to dedicated Internet appliances or home computers, animates many predictions for the Internet?s future (Jones, 2002). The proponents of this vision (chief among them transnational media conglomerates) tout the ability of ?frictionless capitalism? to enable effortless online access to movies, music, newspapers, and e-books (Gates, 1996). Despite a prolonged downturn in the global economy for media and software, the technical and legal design of the Celestial Jukebox nears completion. We examine the development and implications of the Jukebox as it is manifested in several online music subscription services (which we term Music Service Providers, or MSPs), in which the ?Big Five? record companies (Universal, Sony, Warner, BMG, and EMI) provide content and/or hold equity stakes. First, we identify and describe the Celestial Jukebox?s key technical components -- Customer Relationship Management (?eCRM? or ?CRM?) and Digital Rights Management (?DRM?) software. These applications are server-side, ?enterprise-scale? packages deployed by firms distributing intellectual property via Internet commerce. We then discuss the intermeshing characteristics of CRM/DRM, their implementation in MSPs, and the primary stakeholders in these subscription systems. We conclude with a discussion of the MSPs? role in advancing what Mosco (1990) terms ?pay-per? society. While the CRM/DRM technologies integral to the MSP model may lead to long-term commercial viability for the Celestial Jukebox, they may also create substantial opportunities for infringement on consumer rights. Although the MSP model continues to evolve and may depart from present configurations, the Celestial Jukebox enabled by CRM/DRM will be an increasingly important component of American culture, representing as it does the long-standing desire of copyright owners to reduce risk while reaping continuous revenue streams.',\n",

This paper proposes that the potentially most productive approach to discovering those links is research grounded in a framing perspective that is in turn thoroughly grounded in theory \\x96 that is, in its fundamental attachment to the operations of hegemony. Newswork, it is argued, is constitutive of, not separable from frames. A review of a variety of studies conducted with more traditional methodologies, when viewed from a framing perspective, point to the potential of this new theoretical direction.',\n",

Current studies reveal a misleading distinction between \\x93real\\x94 and \\x93symbolic\\x94 synesthesia. Reconsidered as a phenomenon of communication, synesthesia would exist neither as transcendent nor immanent but in-between--emerging in communication. Resolving this dualism implies, for the study of visual communication, that: 1) The interpretation of visual communication will be a co-relation between a person-world, expression-perception intertwining and the historical, cultural, linguistic, metaphoric environment. 2) All of the senses, physical and the psychical, are aspects of a complex sense constellation--embodied intentionanlity. 3) While the \"meaning\" of a communication would be linguistic (metaphorical), this does not mean there is a necessary dualism between language and physics--symbolic and real. 4) Sensual communication is intersensual--visual communication is always already synesthetic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Survey research is a staple to public health practice. However, depending on the type of study and targeted population, response rates can vary greatly. Research examining methods of increasing response to surveys has generally found that techniques which manipulate design variables can increase rates, however extensive testing has resulted in decreased gains over time. In addition, response rates have been declining for a variety of reasons, including increased constraints placed on researchers, competition with marketing organizations, and survey fatigue in the population. Therefore, it is important to consider additional strategies and techniques that can maximize response from potential participants. This study uses the foot-in-the-door technique, originating in the field of social psychology, to increase recruitment of subjects asked to complete a health related questionnaire, and to examine its impact on surveys of varying lengths. Results show the technique can successfully be applied in this context.',\n",

The biggest selling point of Final Fantasy was its revolutionary role as the first feature film with a human cast created entirely by digital technology. My paper considers how and why the film might have failed to perform as well as predicted at the box office by examining its convergent elements at the industrial, formal and cultural levels. More specifically I look at the transition of the film from videogame to film, its narrative and stylistic similarities to and differences from mainstream American films, and its representations of racial and sexual difference, particularly as embodied in its Amerasian white-coded female protagonist. How might the mistranslation or non-translation of these elements into the Hollywood model signify for the future of film and videogame convergence?',\n",

Although a considerable number of empirical studies have dealt with cross-cultural issues using traditional cultural perspectives, there have been few research efforts to observe cultural differences in non-commercial and technology-based communication contexts. A content analysis with a sample of 147 Korean and US personal Web pages was conducted to examine the ongoing validity of two dominant cultural dimensions: Hall¡¯s low-context vs. high-context communication and Hofstede¡¯s individualism vs. collectivism. The results partially supported the explanatory power of both dimensions in new communication environments: there were significant differences between Korean and US personal Web pages in terms of low- and high-context communications and individualism. However, no difference in collectivism between both countries¡¯ personal Web pages was found, nor were there any significant links between low-context communication and individualism and between high-context communication and collectivism.

       "  'abstract': 'This paper explores the relationship between national culture and the structure of international information flows. World System Theory suggests that economic relations between nations are the primary organizing principle of international communication. However, recent research indicates that cultural factors such as language and religion play a significant organizing role. The current research examines the role of culture as an organizing mechanism of the Internet and international telecommunications. National culture is operationalized using Hofstede\\x92s four dimensions of collectivism vs. individualism (IDV), femininity vs. masculinity (MAS), uncertainty avoidance (UAI) and power distance (PDI). The structures of the Internet and international telecommunications are operationalized as communication networks.\\nThe results indicated that national culture is significantly related to the centrality and the structure of the both networks. Centrality in the international telecommunication network is significantly related to IDV and MAS, and centrality on the Internet is significantly related to IDV. Controlling for economics, the relation between individualism and centrality remains significant in both networks. Using the results of the multidimensional scaling to represent network structure, one finds that the first dimension of the telecommunication network is significantly related to MAS and UAI, and the second to IDV. For the Internet, the first dimension is significantly related to IDV, the second to MAS, and the third to PDI.\\nThe paper discusses the limitations of this research and the implications of the findings for globalization, a structural theory of international communication and cultural convergence theory.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Founded upon the theories of Independent-Interdependent Self-Construal and I-C, the main goal of this study was to test, via an adapted IOS Scale, whether Anglo-Canadians were more independent than Mainland Chinese in construing their relationship with family members and friends. Strong cultural differences were found in self-family connectedness, but not in self-friends connectedness. Chinese were closer to their family members than Canadians, but Canadians were as close to their friends as Chinese. In both samples, gender difference was found in self-friends connectedness, but not in self-family connectedness. In the Canadian sample, females were closer to their friends than males, while in the Chinese sample, males were closer to their friends than females. In conclusion, this study contributes to the field in three ways. First, the finding that Canadians are as connected as Chinese to their close friends unprecedentedly contests one fundamental assumption of the theories of independent-interdependent self-construal (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) and I-C (Hofstede,1980; Triandis et al., 1988) that individualists (e.g., Anglo-Canadians) are more independent than collectivists (e.g., Chinese) on all dimensions of human relations. Second, the proposition (Cross & Madson, 1997) that western males and females differ in the same way individualists and collectivists differ in their self-construal is not supported. Finally, the adaptation of the IOS Scale proposes a refreshing direction in cross-cultural research. Graphic representations may be less susceptible to cross-cultural mis-construal than verbal statements since the former involves little or no translation from one language to another.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Change is necessary as organizations respond to their environment, and organizational members must learn to adapt to the ambiguity inherent in such change. From organizational culture literature, several themes emerge as important to a study of organizational culture change. First, changing culture in a lasting way requires attention to a change process, taking time into account. Second, an organization must recognize permeable boundaries and multiple stakeholder groups. Finally, a study of cultural change must consider values that change and those that stay the same. This study addresses these issues by investigating a culture that is in the change process, the Parking, Traffic, and Transportation Service (PTTS) at one of the largest universities in the country. Research questions leading this study include: What is the culture of PTTS? How is the interim director attempting to change that culture? What is changing and what is staying the same in the organization\\x92s culture? What are the reactions of employees to that change? It would seem that PTTS is still in the early stages of what may become a long process. As the new director is hired and the interim director moves out, the organization will be challenged in shaping its image to meet the needs of its expanded stakeholder base, the students, staff, and faculty. And so PTTS members make sense of the change that is taking place to them and around them in different ways. PTTS has more change to come, but as the interim director stated, they seem to be dawning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'An evolutionary framework is used to develop a model of relational functioning among close relational partners. The model proposed focuses on the collaborative nature of close relationships and attempts to highlight two adaptive mechanisms important in creating non-zero sum outcomes among highly interdependent parties. First, our model emphasizes the importance of reciprocity in creating mutually beneficial outcomes through games of exchange (i.e., resource exchange). Additionally, we articulate how the preference for similarity would have been useful when creating non-zero sum rewards through games of coordination. In particular, we focus on the unique role that shared interests and mutual knowledge play when individuals attempt to pursue common goals through joint activity. The implications of our model are discussed with respect to a host of relational issues ranging from uncertainty reduction to satisfaction and commitment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although there is a clear link between parent-adolescent conflict and poor adolescent well-being, less is known about how some parents and adolescents handle conflict constructively while others do not. This study examined this issue by focusing on the demand/withdraw pattern of conflict, which involves one person nagging or criticizing while the other person avoids the topic. A sample of 57 parent-adolescent dyads completed a study that included both self-reports of demand/withdraw and outside ratings of the extent to which the dyad engaged in demand/withdraw during audiotaped conversations. The topics of the conversations included issues important to the parent, issues important to the adolescent, and alcohol and drug use among teenagers. As expected, frequent demand/withdraw was associated with low relational satisfaction, low self-esteem, and high alcohol and drug use for both adolescents and parents. These findings are consistent with the notion that demand/withdraw between parents and adolescents tends to be associated with particularly destructive conflicts that have both indirect health implications (e.g., because low self-esteem is associated with health risk behaviors) and direct health implications (e.g., due to the potential for substance abuse). The results also suggest that to prevent the more common pattern of parent-demand/adolescent-withdraw, it may be important for parents to be responsive (i.e., not withdraw) when adolescents want to discuss an issue, even if the issue is not particularly salient to the parents.',\n",

It also looks at the gendered aspects of caller experiences and beliefs in order to tease out if gender has any influence on the public\\x92s practice of politics. The programme \\x96 Election Call \\x96 is a BBC production which has been broadcasting since 1974, going out simultaneously on radio and TV (and the web for 2001), in the days immediately preceding the British general election. I argue that whilst callers mostly felt very positive about the experience of appearing on the show and having the opportunity to put their point of view, and believed that Election Call fulfilled an important democratic function, they were much more negative in their assessment of their interactions with politicians, believing that it continues to be difficult to get a straight answer out of our elected members.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The broad spectrum diagnosis of depression and the practice of overdiagnosing depression has become common in North American culture over the past two decades. Depression is now a household term, and a viable market of recovery products, particularly psychopharmaceutical drugs, has thus arisen that normalizes not only the diagnosis but new self-help practices. A depression \"script\" shared by scientists, psychiatrists, state policy discourse and advocacy groups has been launched, informing consumers that major depression is a tangible risk, that certain groups (women, children and seniors) are more at risk, and that early detection is necessary to fend off slippage from symptom to major mental disorder. This paper addresses how consumer mental health advocacy groups participate in the promotion of depression diagnoses and the impact of this promotion. The paper analyzes how the discourses of groups including the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill (NAMI) and National Mental Health Consumer\\x92s Self-help Clearing House (NMHCA), among others, promote depression and how these discourses intersect with and diverge from State, pharmaceutical and science discourses. The paper suggests that the consumer advocacy discourse encourages self-scrutiny and the scrutiny of other\\x92s mundane behaviors. More, this increasing attention to our own behaviors causes individuals to self-govern, thereby encouraging a society that circumscribes and restrains potentially deviant moods or behaviors, and constrains free human behavior.',\n",

Findings of experiment one demonstrate that subjects who differ in their self-ratings on masculinity and femininity develop ad attitudes only on the basis of ad-self-congruency on the dimensions that well describe themselves. In addition, the more masculine subjects are, the more they rely on product beliefs in developing brand evaluations. Moreover, the relative effectiveness of ad-self-congruency concerning masculinity or femininity in determining ad attitudes has been shown to vary as a function of product types. Results of experiment one also indicate that quality-oriented ad appeals are more effective for a masculine product than for a feminine product. Experiment two explores the influence of context-induced affective states on the accessibility of the self-concepts regarding masculinity and femininity. Results provide evidence that ad-self-congruency pertinent to masculinity predicts ad attitudes when subjects are in positive affective states, whereas ad-self-congruency pertinent to femininity predicts ad attitudes when subjects are in negative affective states.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dialectic of Community and Fragmentation in Organizing for Social Change\\n\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nIn this study we examined the dialectic between community and fragmentation in two settings that attempt to organize the poor for social change. In the Friday Night Community Suppers there were powerful examples of community. People who participate in this weekly event care deeply about one another and attempt to offer a helping hand whenever they can. There are also instances of fragmentation; however. For example, people experience both forces of the dialectic in a dynamic tension by feeling connected at the Supper but feeling disconnected upon realizing they will return home to an isolated environment. In the soup kitchens we investigated the forces of fragmentation were most compelling. Inhuman treatment by workers, violence among the homeless, and the promotion of degradation prevented most meaningful attempts at community building. Although these forces were dominant, opportunities for community existed alongside fragmentation sustaining the dialectic between the two forces. In some instances volunteers offered consolation and support to the homeless. In other instances the poor themselves provided confirmation and fellowship to others in need. Transcending the dialectic of community and fragmentation is a great challenge and not always possible. However, through the continued building of community even the most damaged people can be offered hope.',\n",

With reference to specific case studies, I investigate three areas where new communication technologies allow and/or obstruct diasporic participation and inclusion in transnational communities. I seek a broad and contextualised understanding of how media and ICTs become tools for empowerment, while allowing diasporic communities to negotiate their belonging in the nation-state of their settlement, the nation-state where they came from and Europe. Many of these diasporic groups use the Internet in an attempt to create a virtual space for empowerment, for self-representation, for recognition and for participation in communities surpassing geographical limits and boundaries. In their diasporic virtual presence, new dynamics of communication and belonging emerge. These challenge the conditions of diasporic communities\\x92 exclusion from real spaces and allow them to actively negotiate their positioning within communities \\x96 virtual and real.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"Organizations have been characterized as interpretive systems (Putnam & Pacanowsky, 1983), where members of different groups of employees may have different interpretations of critical organizational artifacts; this study focuses on employees' interpretations of organizational mission. Organizations must negotiate the following paradox: too much clarity and consensus about interpretations of key organizational artifacts (e.g. mission) may alienate some group members and limit innovation, while too little may cause coordination problems. The principle of unified diversity (Eisenberg, 1984) has been argued as a means through which organizations negotiate this paradox. In its current conceptualization, unified diversity argues that employees think they have similar interpretations to others in the organization, even though they do not. Thus, it does not apply where employees are aware of differences. This paper begins by arguing that the principle of unified diversity may be fruitfully extended to such situations by introducing the concept of recognized unified diversity. This concept argues that employees' are often aware of differences in interpretations, but recognize the importance of these different missions. It is only is cases of scarce resources or controversy that systematic differences concerning the importance different missions emerge. The second part of this paper empirically tests hypotheses deduced from the recognized unified diversity argument. Results show that employees tend to perceive all missions as being important. Additionally, when employees are asked the most important mission or are dealing with controversial issues, systematic differences emerge.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The importance of audience members' feelings toward characters and the relationships formed between viewers and characters has long been established. However, these relationships have only recently received the necessary conceptual attention. The present research is designed to test the claim that like social relationships, viewer-character relationships come in more than one form. Two studies examine possible differences between identification, parasocial interaction and imitation, three of the most commonly used terms to describe how viewers relate to television characters. Results show that the three relationships are related to different viewing motives, involvement and reactions to viewing. Furthermore, significant differences in the intensity of these three relationships were found when viewers were asked to choose a character with which they identified or with who they felt friends or whom they wanted to imitate. It is suggested that a more precise understanding of these various types of relationships should help understand the functions they perform for viewers and their role in reception and media effects.\",\n",

Developing countries, such as Brazil, which have experienced tremendous growth during the last half of the twentieth century, have only recently begun to investigate this disparity.\\nThe origins of the divide in Brazil are closely tied to the erratic development and deployment of communication technologies like basic telephone service, and policies favoring the southern regions of the country. These economic developments have lead to a clear technological divide along racial, economic and regional lines. Data demonstrating the divide along these lines are presented, along with information on governmental, civic and non-profit movements targeting the digital gap.',\n",

The research reported here examines differences in access levels and currency (e.g., having the latest version of the technology) for five communication technologies relevant to the workplace: email, voicemail, mobile phones, fax, and videoconferencing. In doing so, we have drawn on research examining the Digital Divide more generally and applied an organizational justice/fairness framework to help describe differences both within and between organizations. Survey questionnaires from 137 respondents from a diverse set of organizations reveals the existence of various communication technology divides especially within, but also between, organizations. Although these divides were largely unrelated to fairness outcomes, the differences in access and currency did vary depending on the communication technology being examined.',\n",

This article explores this dynamic in the language learning of Finnish students as they respond to the speech of native (Americans) and non-native (Austrian) speakers of English. The analyses show 1) how there are implicit meanings in culturally salient concepts such as the English terms \"shy\" and \"equality,\" 2) how the various meanings for these terms create multiple third spaces (MTS) within English, between different cultural spheres of coherence, and 3) how these MTS are\\nfull of potential problems in interpretation since the English terms carry different meanings in Finnish English, in Austrian English, and in (US)American English. Integration of CDIM into language learning emphasizes the importance of moving back and forth between versions of English and the different cultural practices on which these are based.

       "  'abstract': 'The following study sought to collate and analyze portrayals of the Texas-Mexico Border region told through newspaper stories, establishing benchmark descriptive data for further research in the process. Using a sample of nearly 700 newspaper articles from several geographic areas covering three years (1991, 1997 and 2001), the researchers looked at several aspects of coverage, including tone, length, sources, and use of stereotypical or emotional words.\\nThe beginning hypothesis was that the farther the newspaper from the Texas border, the more cursory, stereotypical and conflict-heavy the stories would be. Taking the news value concept of proximity\\x97most effectively rendered by the axiom, \"1,000 dead in Bangladesh equals 100 dead in London, 10 dead in New York and one dead in your American city\"\\x97the study set out to illustrate it using a content analysis of news stories plus a qualitative discussion and discussion of the values behind news and behind building/maintaining/changing cultural identities as well.\\nThe border region, in particular, has suffered greatly from surface, usually melodramatic portrayals (Martinez 1998). As an area traditionally behind the curve in terms of both state and national funding, and one which has been torn between identification with Mexico and the United States, the Rio Grande Valley of Texas can be said to have suffered from a double marginality, whereby it has been isolated from centers of both government power and mainstream news coverage. Neither fish nor fowl, the border region, especially the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, has been a consistent second-class citizen, according to many researchers (Martinez 1998, Weber 1988, Miller 1980).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Discussing politics for many people is a daily event. Personal interactions seem to influence individuals¡¦ attitudes and behavior. Does the role of interpersonal discussion on politics certainly have an impact on our attitudes toward political issues? This paper is to answer this question by looking into the relationship between discussing politics with weak tie discussants, e.g. friends and coworkers, and the expression of political tolerance, which is an important orientation of democracy and social pluralism.\\nBased on the survey data of 2000 American National Election Research in the presidential election season, the results of logistic regression analysis show that the impact of political discussion and the impact of weak-tie networks on both general moral tolerance and specific tolerance toward homosexual groups are not as significant as expected.\\nNevertheless, missing values of survey data can decrease the significance of relationships between variables. In the second part of the paper, the author further compares the original results derived from ANES dataset from that derived from same dataset but with the problem of missing values fixed. Finding that missing values in this case did cause different results, the author concludes that the impact of interpersonal political discussion needs more examination.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Changes in the nature of political campaigns are considered to be one of the primary factors contributing to the decline in turnout since the 1960s. Political parties are assumed to be less effective in mobilizing voters, candidates are assumed to be less appealing, and media coverage has been viewed as having a demobilizing effect on the electorate. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of campaigns in mobilizing voters in presidential elections over time. Using data from 1972 to 2000, we find that there has been a resurgence of party mobilization since 1992 and that the effectiveness of party contacting has increased somewhat over time. Other factors, such as media coverage and polarized opinions about the candidates appear to stimulate rather than deter voters.',\n",

In study one, participants responded to the uses and gratifications scale for television use in general, for their gratifications sought and obtained from specific television programs, and for their favorite movie. In study 2, participants were randomly assigned to keep media use diaries for either television or movie viewing or use of the Internet. In general, we found that participants do feel confident about their ability to access their media use motives but that confidence varies by media use activity. Specifically, participants were more certain of their reasons for watching a favorite movie or a specific program than they were of their reasons for watching television in general. They were also significantly more aware of their motives for using the Internet than for watching television. Lastly, we found ritualized and instrumental viewers differed in how certain they felt about their viewing motives. Implications for uses and gratifications research and method are discussed.',\n",

The results provide evidence that overall, presidential candidates addressed more of their party¡¯s issues in their TV spots. But Democrats emphasized particularly welfare/health care issue, whereas Republicans especially stressed inflation/interest rates among their issues. This study also revealed that there are exceptions of issue ownership from election to election. Across the elections, Republicans have been more consistent in addressing their own issues than have Democrats. Democrats used their issues more than Republican issues both for acclaims and attacks.

Perceptions of the ideal female body shape moved toward a heavier ideal after exposure to plus-size models in comparison to exposure to thin models. This effect was significant for both men and women. In a follow-up experiment, an elastic body image effect was found in the plus-models condition, but not the thin-models condition. Women who saw plus-size models rated their actual body shapes to be slightly heavier than their pre-exposure estimations. However, no significant shifts were observed among women who saw thin models. Various social judgment biases were identified. Most notably, women tend to overestimate men\\x92s preference for thinness. Men, on the other hand, present conflicting data. Compared to women, men preferred a heavier female ideal. On the other hand, men also found thin models to be more attractive than plus-size models.

Separating their effects on how anonymous individuals perceive themselves to be is a relevant issue that has not been sufficiently explored. This paper explores whether, controlling for source anonymity, visual anonymity has significant effects on how anonymous individuals perceive themselves to be. Additionally, it is suggested that public self-awareness mediates the relationship between visual cues and perception of self-anonymity by individuals. Findings indicate that the relationship between visual cues and perception of self-anonymity is not significant once source anonymity is controlled. Further, findings also suggest that public self-awareness has a strong relationship with perceptions of self-anonymity. Further, other factors such as cognitive effort are found to be related to public self-awareness. The implications of such results are that future studies should focus on perceptions of anonymity as much as on the researchers\\x92 manipulations of anonymity. Further, public self-awareness is strongly related to perceptions of self-anonymity. Public self-awareness is also related to other factors besides visual cues and manipulations of anonymity.

One issue that has not been raised in this area of research is what happens to a consumer who is not able to carry out the desired behavior because of lack of economic resources. Research has suggested that people of lesser economic means are particularly harmed by constant media messages of consumerism because they have no way to relieve the created consumerist wants and desires (West, 1994). It is possible that the inability to pursue wants and desires evoked by ads for luxury products could lead to differential patterns of emotional cognitive responding during processing of an advertisement. This study investigates differences in emotional and cognitive responses as revealed through physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance, and facial EMG) for young college students of different socio-economic levels.\\n\\nAdvertising , materialism, and SES\\nOne of the established effects of advertising is that it increases peoples\\' desires for consumer goods and promotes materialism. Some researchers, e.g., Galbraith (1967), even see advertising as \"relentless propaganda on behalf of goods in general.\" Advertising, it is argued, stirs, or creates, desires and needs in people for more material goods. These needs are never completely satisfied, however, because, once a product is bought, a new one appears in the market to replace it, creating yet a new need (Galbraith, 1958). Thus, as Crisp (1987) argues, advertising overrides a consumer\\'s autonomy of decision making in the creation of these desires, by offering an unshakable link between products and the fulfillment of desires for them.\\nA number of studies have investigated the association between advertising and materialism levels, but none has focused specifically on the role of socio-economic status as a potential intervening variable in that process. Nevertheless, the findings of previous research on advertising, materialism levels, and demographics are instructive in the formulation of a proposition to be tested in this research.\\nIn general, materialism is defined as the idea that people gain personal satisfaction from owning objects (Yoon, 1995). Further, materialism is a consumer value characterized by possessiveness, non-generosity and envy (Belk, 1984, 1985), and by acquisition centrality, which means that material acquisition is crucial to one\\'s life and success (Richins & Dawson, 1992). Materialism is also associated with other negative consequences, such as self-hatred and greed.\\nRobertson, et al. (1989) examined the effects of advertising exposure on the level of demand displayed by children of their parents. As television viewing (the operationalization of advertising exposure) increased, the number of product requests increased. Unfortunately, that study did not look at the possible interaction with demographic variables.\\nYoon (1995) investigated the relationship between attitudes toward advertising in general and materialism beliefs among Caucasians and African Americans. The sample consisted of college students and adults from the same community (found through mall-intercepts). The results showed African Americans held more materialistic values and were more positive about advertising than Caucasians. The study did not explore the differential effects of socio-economic status specifically. Consequently, it is not possible to tell whether the African American sample was of a different socio-economic status compared to the Caucasian sample.\\nWhat happens when a person is not able to satisfy the needs instilled in a materialistic culture, partly by advertising? Do these needs ferment in a person, accumulating over time, forming higher levels of anxiety, tension and frustration? Or do consumers become desensitized, as the literature on other media messages, specifically television and movie violence, has suggested?\\n\\nStudy general proposition and specific hypotheses\\nConsumption is constrained by disposable income. As a general rule, consumers cannot purchase products if they have no money. Indeed, Quarles and Jeffries (1983) show that overall consumption levels are predicted best by disposable income, not by the amount of advertising to which one is exposed. The most critical question, as these authors suggest, is how people react \"when material expectations exceed economic ability\" (p. 13).\\nThere is no evidence so far that consumers\\x92 desires, created by advertising, would simply disappear when they lack disposable income. In general, people feel comfortable in a state in which their attitudes and behaviors match. If attitudes and behaviors cannot reach a congruency, people experience a motivational state of arousal (first conceptualized and tested by Festinger, 1957). Specifically, as the phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance shows, people experience a drive or pressure to reduce this arousal by changing either their beliefs, or their behaviors or both.\\nIt is reasonable to believe that cognitive dissonance would occur among college-age consumers who, through advertising, develop a desire for a product at the present time but can not afford it. One indication of the occurrence of cognitive dissonance could be emotional responses to the ads. This study investigates the emotional state of such consumers as a result of advertising for products that they may not be able to afford.\\nAdvertising researchers have used physiological measures to assess cognitive and emotional responses to advertising. Heart rate has been used to measure attention paid to television advertisements (Bolls, Yoon, Lang, & Potter, 1997) and presence of mental imagery during exposure to radio advertisements (Bolls & Potter, 1998). Skin conductance has been used as a measure of arousal and response to sales appeal during television advertisements (Hopkins & Fletcher, 1994). Recently, facial EMG has been used to measure the valence of emotional response to radio advertisements (Bolls, Potter, Lang, Floyd-Snyder, 1999). The measurement of physiological responses during exposure to advertisements provides information that cannot be obtained through self-report measures alone. Taken together, physiological and self-report data have the potential to provide detailed insight into the nature of emotional and cognitive responses evoked by advertisements.\\nBased on Robertson, et al. (1989)\\x92s findings that advertising exposure was positively related to product requests, we expect that:\\nH1: People higher in pre-exposure materialism scores will report that they pay more attention to advertising, in general. In other words, there will be a positive relationship between inherent materialism levels and advertising exposure.\\n\\nBuilding on the cognitive dissonance literature, we predict that there will be a relationship between advertising exposure, socio-economic status, and emotional responses to the ads.\\nH2: Consumers of lower family income will find the advertisements less pleasing.\\nH3: Consumers of lower family income will find the advertisements more exciting.\\n\\n\\nMethod\\nThe study will be a 2 (high/low family income level - between subjects) x 2 (high/low product cost - within subjects) x 8 (product item - within subjects) x 4 (order - between subjects) design. All participants will be exposed to the same set of commercials. The study controls for television use, attention to advertising, previous exposure to the ads used in the study, attitudes toward the advertised products and brands, and demographic variables, such as age, gender, and racial or ethnic background.\\n\\nProcedure and stimulus materials\\nThe study will be conducted with one participant at a time in a psychophysiological lab. Participants will be college freshman. The participants will each answer a short pre-test questionnaire, probing television watching, attention paid to advertisements, materialism beliefs, and semantic-differential-scale items measuring pre-existing attitudes to the about to be seen products (bad/good; unfavorable/favorable; dislike/like).\\nFollowing this questionnaire, each participant will view a series of eight commercials for different products, four low-cost items and four high-cost items. The commercials were selected from television shows aimed at young adults. All spots are 30 seconds in length. High cost items cost at least $200 and low cost items were under $100. Four orders of exposure have been created to control for order effects.\\nPhysiological data will be collected for a five second baseline prior to each advertisement and during exposure to the advertisements. After each commercial, the participants will fill out a series of questions in reaction to the ad: Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scales, attitudes toward the ad and the brand, and control questions about whether they had seen this commercial before and whether they owned the product.\\nAfter the last commercial, the participants will answer a post-test set of questions including the materialism scale and demographic items. Participants will then be debriefed, thanked, and excused.\\nThe findings will be discussed in terms of the consequences these emotional responses may have for consumers of lower socio-economic status. Is our society raising a large group of people who are constantly exposed to, but cannot hope to participate in, the system of values advertising espouses? How do they cope with such discrepancy between the media reality and their own economically-constrained reality?\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAlbion, M. S., & Farris, P. W. (1981).

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Significance of the study\\nUntil recently much of the research on memory from television news focused on memory of the verbal information and all but ignored the effects of the visual stream. A growing number of studies show that viewers process information from both the audio and visual streams together and that one channel can affect memory for the other. This study looks at the synergistic relationship between verbal and visual information \\x96 the way audio and video interact to intensify one another and affect overall memory for the message.\\nRedundancy refers to the degree of congruence between the information in the audio and video channels of a message. Previous studies show that messages that have incongruent information between their audio and video streams receive less thorough processing than redundant messages.\\nAccording to the limited capacity theory of information processing for mediated messages, there is a limited amount of resources available for processing information. If a message requires a lot of resources beyond which the viewer has an overload occurs and the processing is not completed; that is important information in the message does not go through the stages of encoding, storage and retrieval.\\nThis study is among a few that tests a specific kind of audio/visual redundancy, redundancy in valence. It often happens that the verbal content in the audio stream is negative of a subject and the video accompanying it is positive of the subject or vice versa where the audio is positive but the video is negative.\\nResearch Question1 Is there a main effect of emotional audio/visual redundancy on overall recall for the message?\\nIt also tests the visual superiority hypothesis that holds that visuals are easier to process that verbal information in the audio.\\nResearch question 2: Overall do subjects recall more of the information coming from the video channel than the audio channel?\\nValence is one dimension of emotion it measures the direction of emotion on a scale from positive to negative. Arousal is another dimension that measures intensity of emotion and ranges on a scale from calm to excited. Recent research is showing that, arousal controlled, positive messages are more thoroughly processed than negative messages.\\nResearch question 3 : Is there a valence effect; is the channel carrying the positive information more thoroughly processed than the one carrying the negative information?\\nCognitive studies on specialization of the brain\\x92s hemispheres have shown that there can be some sort of hemispheric lateralization. The right brain which is the center for visual processing is also the center for processing negative emotions while the left brain which is the center for verbal processing is also the center for processing positive emotion. Such studies found some support to the hypothesis that negative messages are more thoroughly processed when carried in the video and positive messages are more thoroughly processed when carried in the audio. Hence the last research question,\\nResearch question 4: Is there a channel by valence interaction; do positive messages get more through processing when carried in the audio than in the video and do negative messages get more thorough processing when carried in the video than when in the audio?\\nThe study will help shed light on how viewers process information from television and the impact that emotions in the message have on overall recall. It is practical interest to messages with an informational content (like news and education) and those with persuasive content (like advertising and political campaigns).\\nDesign:\\nThis is a 2(redundancy) X 2(channel) X 2(valence) X 3(story) X 3(order) design. Order is between subjects while redundancy, channel, valence and story are within subjects.\\nRedundancy has two levels redundant and non redundant. Valence has two levels positive valence and negative valence. Arousal is controlled for in the stories by keeping it low. Channel also has two levels audio track and video track. Story is the number of stories for each of the four conditions of redundant positive, redundant negative, non redundant with audio track carrying the positive and video track carrying the negative, and non redundant with the audio track carrying the negative and the video track carrying the positive.\\nFrom a sample of 36 news stories, 12 will be chosen, three in each of the conditions. The stories are chosen based on two pretests. The first measures valence in the two streams of each news story and the second measures the overall relatedness (redundancy) between the two channels in each news story. A total of 40 subjects who are undergraduates will participate in the experiment.\\nDependent variables:\\nFree recall: Subjects will list the news stories they watched.\\nCued recall (audio/video): Only the topic of the news story will be presented to subjects. Their writing will then be analyzed for relevant important information recalled from the audio and the video. What is regarded as \\x93important\\x94 information in each story is decided by a panel of professors with broadcast experience. The panel viewed the 12 stories and came up with a list of important pieces of information three in the audio and three in the video.\\nRecognition (audio/video): 48 multiple-choice questions (4 for each news story) will test subjects\\x92 recall of important information in the story. Two of the four will be geared to information in the audio and two will be geared to information in the video. The questions are pre-tested avoid any ceiling or floor effects.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Arab Women Speak Out (AWSO), an advocacy and training program, is centered around the life histories of thirty Arab women who have achieved their goals by overcoming social, economic or political obstacles. Arab women researchers and filmmakers produced the materials, which include a series of ten documentary video profiles, training and discussion materials, a tool for monitoring the image of women in the media and a case history publication profiling 30 women who have achieved personal and professional goals in diverse areas. With their discussions guided by a moderator and a training manual, nearly 80,000 women from six Arab countries have participated in the program. During the training workshops, facilitators convey critical thinking skills and encourage women to interrogate gender, refine their negotiating skills, strengthen social networks, and participate in public life, among other topics. The 2001 evaluation survey used a posttest-only control group design. Qualitative research complemented the survey findings. This study sought to answer this central question: \"Was participation in this particular communication program related to changes in the aforementioned variables and, ultimately, to human agency or the propensity to act?\" A partial answer was found using multiple logistic regression: the odds of starting a new business venture were 2.5 times greater for participants than for non-participants, while the odds of taking an active part in community meetings was 2.3 times greater for participants than for non-participants. The presentation will discuss other findings in light of the theoretical framework that informed program design and guided the analysis.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'This paper reports on an experiment designed to assess viewer responses to the nonverbal behavior of the president in the context of compelling news events. Subjects were shown a series of four news story-presidential reaction audio-visual sequences that varied by story topic, level of emotion, and degree of appropriateness. Cognitive, emotional, and physiological measures were used to assess subject responses to news story-presidential reaction message sequences, including heart rate, skin conductance, the Self-Assessment Manikin affect scale, recognition memory, and facial EMG (electromyography) indexing smile and frowning muscle activation. Results indicate that evaluations of the display\\x92s appropriateness seems to moderate how much attention is given to the display, the affective direction of viewers\\x92 facial muscle activation, and the level of autonomic activation, or arousal. The EMG data showed that viewers frowned in response to positive expressive displays that followed intense or positive news. Smiling activation correspondingly decreased for positive displays that followed intense news. These counterempathic results shed new light on the capacity of leader displays to influence viewers of political news. While much EMG and physiological research has focused on emotional congruent processes, e.g. positive reactions in response to positive facial displays, this study demonstrates the effects of incongruency in political display behavior. A political leader\\x92s smile is no guarantee of a positive evaluation. If deemed inappropriate to the news context, negative consequences arise from what is viewed as a clear violation of nonverbal expectations. Recognition memory for verbal information in the news narrative also suffers such that encoding of factual knowledge is impaired. It is argued that leader displays that violate viewer expectations remain a likely source of voter doubt.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study merges insights from extant cultivation research with a media uses and gratifications perspective to examine the relationship between environmental concern, five forms of television viewing, and pro-environmental behaviors. In doing so, we consider a host of variables, including environmental attitudes, that are exogenous to television use and environmental behaviors and may motivate certain viewing patterns and social actions. Thus, the perspective advanced by this research considers both the direct effects of various forms of television viewing and their potential mediating roles in the relationship between environmental attitudes and behaviors. Analysis of the 1999 and 2000 DDB Life Style Study data reveals that television public affairs and nature documentary use, the two genres of programming that give tangible and visible form to abstract environmental issues, are predicted by environmental concern and contribute to pro-environmental behaviors, whereas the three forms of entertainment television use are not consistently linked to these variables. Public affairs and nature documentary use were also found to be important mediators of the effects of other exogenous variables on pro-environmental behaviors. Implications for future research are discussed.',\n",

During those interactive communication processes, personal data are often collected not only in an explicit manner (f.e. using electronic forms), but in an implicit manner as well (f.e. using cookies and clickstream analysis for webmining). The collection and use of data of internet users for marketing purposes raises questions concerning the protection of the consumers\\x92 online privacy. To protect the informational privacy (i.e. dataprotection) and the relational privacy (i.e. in this domain the right not to be contacted by companies for marketing purposes) legislative initiatives have been taken in the European Union. From an analysis of 250 Belgian websites it results that the majority, collecting personal data, score largely unsatisfactorily concerning the information towards the consumer, as imposed by the European dataprotection directive transposed in the Belgian privacy law. This first analysis of websites in march 2001 (before the new privacy law came into effect on september 1st) and a second analysis, one year later, in april 2002 forms part of series researches about e-privacy, the protection of internet users' privacy.\\nThis research shows also the necessity to build bridges between the study of law and selfregulation (in the EU a.o. the European Dataprotection Directive transposed in the national privacylaws), ICT studies (to analyse privacy invasive and privacy enhancing technologies) and communication science, to develop an online research instrument to \\x91scan\\x92 the websites concerning the use of software to analyse the clickstream of visitors, to check the ways in which data are processed and how website visitors are informed about their privacy rights. Finally, our methodology consisted also in sending a mystery e-mail to the webmasters of the selected websites to check their knowledge about their own online privacy pledge.\",\n",

Yet, these campaigns can raise ethical dilemmas, especially in regards to the marketing of harmful products and the targeting of vulnerable consumers. This paper identifies aspects of target marketing that can be ethically questionable, including the method of persuasion, the nature of the product and the target. Differences among marketing, advertising and public relations are discussed to determine whether one of these communication tools produces more potential for ethical dilemmas then the others. Also, the role of the product, paying special attention to sin products, is examined as well as the perceived vulnerability of the target audience. Finally, the present research provides a foundation for future studies on where ethical decision-making should begin and what guidelines should be followed for ethically evaluating target marketing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Employing narrative analysis of ethnographic interviews with persons from a variety of socioeconomic, educational, and racial/ethnic backgrounds, this paper examines the discursive structure of the digital divide debate as it is articulated among contemporary online users and non-users in the United States. The paper argues that the discourse of individualism serves as a filter that shapes and distorts all private and public conversations about the digital divide and thus limits public debate on the subject. We consider the ways in which secondary topics of technological determinism, educational benefit, and consumer choice are shaped through this filter of individualism. Finally, we explore the extent to which there exists what Jameson (1987) has proposed is a ?third language? that struggles for legitimacy against the first language of individualism: that of Marxist critique. We note that there are nascent hints of this ?third language? in the ways that the digital divide is discussed relative to the specific, lived situations of economic disadvantage among some respondents. Yet we conclude that the potential political power of this ?third language? is muted as it echoes rather than challenges the contradictions inherent to the promise of the digital era that are found at the heart of both corporate advertising and current social policies.',\n",

To this end, we differentiate that perspective\\x92s assumptions about human nature and behavior from those held by the traditional social sciences and humanities. We argue that there is mounting evidence to suggest that all humans come equipped at birth with the same content-specific information processing mechanisms, and that these are a product of adaptive pressures our hominid ancestors faced during our evolutionary past. We posit also that those psychological adaptations of immediate relevance to organizational communication scholars are likely to be those that center upon our hard wiring for reciprocation and its coordination. We offer several bodies of evidence for our position. Besides the anecdotal evidence that we can all identify with, we offer an analysis of the employee-organization exchange contract, which draws on current socialization scholarship, and a few examples of the rigorous testing of adaptations that evolutionary psychologists themselves have conducted. In addition, we argue that the emotions we display in organizations are strongly tied to our perceptions of equitable resource exchange, and that using emotions as a starting point in our research can help us more readily identify the underlying causal mechanisms for our communication practices. Finally, we point to the universality of exchange and coordination.',\n",

In this paper, four experiments are reported on a heuristic applicable in fundraising contexts: the so-called desert heuristic. This heuristic implies that people do not support a person who is held responsible for the trouble he or she is in. Fundraising organizations do not raise funds for an individual person but for a group of patients. In that case, the stereotypical (responsibility) perception of those patients is at stake. In four experiments, it is shown that the use of exemplars in fundraising letters can influence the stereotypical responsibility perception of the category and that this perception can influence the intention to donate money especially when the type of problem is less serious. Cultural differences do not appear to play a decisive role.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study explores how a Korean multinational organization manages its global public relations and how the culture variable influences its global public relations execution. This study focuses on the question of whether societal culture supersedes organizational culture in public relations practices. Qualitative data collected from long interviews revealed that the organization is practicing global public relations rather than international public relations. At the core of global public relations practice, the organization¡¯s corporate philosophy is playing a role of generic principles. The evidence from interviews showed that practitioners in the organization are using dual cultural measures. In a domestic setting, societal culture, especially Confucian tradition, is prominent because the organization has to be adjusted to the social norm to survive in Korean markets. However, societal culture cannot play as much influence as, in a global setting, it does in a domestic setting.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During the past several decades, a number of scholars and social critics have discussed the growth of celebrity culture within the United States. They note that many people now model their personal lives after celebrities rather than looking to traditional heroes as their role models. The terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, might have changed the boundary between celebrities and heroes. A sense of heroism was renewed in the public arena by the courageous acts of many people on that fateful day. In this paper, we assess these changes through a study of visitors to the temporary memorial at the United Airlines Flight 93 crash site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Results from our study indicate that the many common heroes who emerged in September 11th may now temper the strong influence of celebrities on public beliefs and practices. Implications of this research for the study of social influence are discussed.',\n",

Although suicidologists have identified communication as a critical part of the suicide/suicide prevention process, communication researchers have not given suicidal communication the attention it deserves.

Attachment styles in addition to frequency of hurtful messages and degree of hurt were examined in 37 romantically involved couples. Based on the tenets of attachment theory, it was argued that hurtful messages are a form of insensitivity or unresponsivity (i.e., the broad category of interactions that influence the attachment relationships formed). Consequently, frequency of hurtful messages as well as degree of hurt experienced were hypothesized to be related to attachment styles. As predicted, results showed that secure tendencies were negatively related to the frequency of hurtful messages reported in the general relationship, whereas preoccupied and dismissive-avoidant tendencies were positively related with the frequency of hurtful messages. Regarding the degree of hurt reported during a specific conflict episode, secure tendencies were positively related to degree of hurt, whereas dismissive-avoidant and preoccupied tendencies were negatively, but weakly, related to degree of hurt experienced. Results are discussed in terms of implications for attachment theory.',\n",

The purpose was to examine arousal responses to politicians engaged in face-to-face political debate, and to examine whether production characteristics of televised portrayals alter memory after viewing. Using videotapes of political talk shows created expressly for these experiments, results showed that the less civil versions of the same exchange of political views created greater arousal in viewers as measured by skin conductance levels. Likewise, those who watched the talk show from a close-up camera perspective experienced greater arousal than those who watched the same exchanges shot from a medium camera distance. A second experiment focused on the consequences of heightened arousal for memory. Consistent with the literature on arousal, memory for the main emphasis of the exchange \\x96 the candidates\\x92 differing issue positions \\x96 was enhanced by the highly arousing, uncivil presentations. But memory for details \\x96 the arguments underlying those same positions -- was suppressed by the highly arousing presentations.

Thus, the application method of how both judicial bodies evaluate commercial speech restrictions is remarkably similar. Both courts consider the legitimacy of the restriction as well as the necessity of the restriction as the most prudent manner to pursue the stated aim. Two crucial characteristics of the European Court's approach distinguish its decisions: commercial speech has always received full protection and the criteria for determining if commercial speech could be legally restricted are found in the written articles regarding expression.\",\n",

In these theories, individuals select a particular medium for communication based on congruence of the message requirements and the capability of the medium to meet these requirements. Congruence will lead to more effective (satisfying, efficient) communication. Many critiques, and extensions to address these critiques, have been advanced. However, the extensions to date have not generally addressed ongoing communication streams or the concept of reciprocity in media usage. This paper briefly critiques two media capacity theories, media richness and social presence, focusing on this gap and presents a theoretical extension to media capacity theories to address this limitation. This paper moves beyond the \\x93first communicative encounter\\x94 that often serves as a foundation for media capacity arguments by including the concepts of inattentive reciprocation by a sender and the influence of historical media choices on a sender\\x92s reply.',\n",

In light of the growing globalization of world economy and the fact that more companies are setting up branches around the world, we would like to address the issue of cultural adaptation for employees in a multicultural organization. Samsung-Tijuana Park is the site for a Korean electronic company and its manufacture site in the U.S.-Mexican border city of Tijuana. One the one hand, Koreans move to Mexico and face a real sense of cultural adaptation into the host culture. On the other, local Mexican employees also need to adapt to the Korean organization culture. Through a search in previous literature on culture adaptation, we determined four factors about the individual\\'s conditions: preparation, expectation, communication skills, and time in contact with the second culture. Many adaptation models use stages to represent the process, therefore, we summarized four states: anticipation, peak, valley, and smooth. We treated these eight concepts as variables and focused our study on finding possible correlations among them. Results show a general tendency for positive factors such as preparation and communication abilities to be positively correlated to positive states of adaptation such as peak and smooth. Consequently, there is a negative correlation between these positive factors and the valley state, which is the most obvious negative state. The similar patterns of correlation for both the Korean and Mexican cultural groups suggest that adaptation takes place when both parties are involved in the effort. We use the term \"co-acculturation.\" Limitations and future directions are discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"A survey of 363 Las Vegas residents examined the relationship between their media use and anomie. The analysis also controlled for several demographic variables. The goal was to determine how media use affects feelings of anomie. Anomie was measured with Srole's classic scale of anomie. Several modes of media were examined. The findings show that print media use tended to alleviate feelings of anomie. Broadcast media had mixed effects on anomie. Under some demographic conditions, broadcast media use reduced the feeling of anomie and under other conditions it engendered it. Newer forms of media such as e-mail, use of the world wide web, and webTV had no effect on anomie. Playing computer games and watching satellite television, however, were associated with increased feelings of anomie.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Fear on the Radio: Cognitive and emotional responses to high-fear high-imagery messages',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'How does the level of imagery in high fear radio public service announcements affect cognitive and emotional processing of the message? A significant body of research has explored information processing of high fear messages (i.e. LaTour & Pitts, 1989; Mewborn & Rogers, 1979; Rogers, 1983; Witte, 1992) but none of the research has addressed the role production features like imagery play in information processing of the message. Boster and Mongeau (1984) suggested, at the end of their meta-analysis of studies of fear-arousing messages, that \"it is not clear exactly what features of a persuasive message are fear arousing\" (p. 370). They also argue that \"the manipulation of fear and the manipulations of other relevant independent variables are often confounded\" (p. 366). The purpose of this study is to more clearly manipulate fear by separating a fearful topic from the imagery level used in messages on the topic. More specifically, this study will examine how imagery in high-fear radio public service announcements affects attention, arousal and negative emotional valence.\\nPrevious research has found that imagery results in a greater focus of attention to internal mental processes as evidenced by faster heart rate during exposure to high-imagery radio messages compared to low-imagery messages (author cite). Radio messages with negative emotional valence have been found to result in greater attention paid externally to the message as evidenced by slower heart rate during negative compared to positive messages (author cite). Researchers have not investigated whether during high-imagery, high-fear messages listeners focus attention internally to the process of mental imagery or externally on the message. In an exploratory study this author found participants heart rate to be slower during exposure to high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages suggesting that participants were primarily allocating attention externally to the message. This study will attempt to replicate the exploratory study. The following hypothesis will be tested:\\nH1: Heart rate will be slower during exposure to high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages.\\nIf fear appeal interferes with the ability to focus attention internally to generating mental images during exposure to high-imagery messages it is possible that after exposure, participants will be able to allocate attention to generating mental images when cognitive resources are no longer needed to process the incoming message. Thus, if people are instructed to think about the message, they should experience greater mental imagery while thinking about high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages. This leads to the following hypothesis:\\nH2: Heart rate will be faster for high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages after exposure when participants are instructed to think about a message.\\nGiven that negative messages result in attention being allocated externally to the message it could be that the experience of negative emotion is what interferes with the ability to allocate attention internally to mental imagery. Previous research has shown that negative emotion can be measured with facial EMG by measuring activity over the Corrugator muscle (Eckman, 1993). This study will explore the possibility that negative emotion interferes mental imagery during exposure by testing the following hypothesis:\\nH3: Corrugator muscle activity will be greater during exposure to high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages.\\nPrevious research has also demonstrated that both negative emotion and imagery are production features that intensify arousal (Lang, Dhillon & Dong, 1995; author cite) as evidenced by increased skin conductance. This leads to a final hypothesis:\\nH4: Skin conductance will be greater during exposure to high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages.\\nMethod\\nIndependent Variable\\nImagery\\nImagery is conceptually defined as production features of radio that engage listeners in imagery processing. According to previous research sound effects and descriptive wording increase the imagery level of a radio announcement (Miller & Marks, 1997). Imagery will be manipulated through the presence of sound effects and descriptive wording in the copy.\\nDependent Variables\\nAttention\\nAttention is mental effort put into processing the radio announcements. Heart rate will be obtained as a measure of attention. Participants\\' heart rate will be measured for a five second baseline prior to onset of each message, time-locked to exposure to each message and for a 30 second post-exposure period during which participants will be instructed to think about the message they just listened to. Heart rate will be collected as milliseconds between beats and converted to beats per minute.\\nEmotional Valence\\nEmotional valence is a dimension of emotion that has to do with how positive or negative a person feels. Negative emotional valence will be measured in this study through facial EMG. Corrugator muscle activity will be measured for a five second baseline prior to onset of each message, time-locked to exposure to each message and for a 30 second post-exposure period during which participants will be instructed to think about the message they just listened to. Self-reported emotional valence will also be obtained by having participants complete the SAM (self-assessment mannequin) scale (Lang, Greenwald, Bradley & Hamm, 1993).\\nArousal\\nArousal is a dimension of emotion that reflects how excited our calm a person feels. Arousal will be measured by obtaining participants\\' skin conductance. Skin conductance will be measured for a five second baseline prior to onset of each message, time-locked to exposure to each message and for a 30 second post-exposure period during which participants will be instructed to think about the message they just listened to. Self-reported arousal will also be obtained by having participants complete the SAM (self-assessment mannequin) scale (Lang, Greenwald, Bradley & Hamm, 1993).\\nDesign\\nThis experiment will use a 2 (Imagery) X 3 (Message Topic) X 3 (Order) repeated measures mixed model design. Imagery and Message Topic are within subjects variable. The messages will be recorded in three different orders and participants will be randomly assigned to listen to one of the orders.\\nStimuli\\nA survey conducted in Fall 2001 of 95 undergraduates at a large northwestern university indicated that pregnancy, contracting a sexually transmitted disease and being the victim of a drunk driver are high fear issues. A 60 second high imagery and low imagery message was produced for each of the high fear message topics. The high imagery messages featured a storyline with descriptive wording and sound effects. The low imagery messages featured college students talking about why they fear each topic. Six low fear messages will also be included as stimuli in order to keep participants from becoming overly sensitized to fear appeal. These low fear messages were obtained from the Ad Council and have been pre-tested to ensure they are indeed low fear.\\nProcedure\\nParticipants will be forty undergraduate students enrolled in Communication courses at a large northwestern university. Participants will complete the experiment one at a time in a psychophysiology lab. Informed consent will be obtained and then participants will be prepped for the collection of physiological data. All instructions for the experiment will be recorded onto audio tape and played for participants. Instructions for completing the self-report measures will be played followed by instructions for the post-exposure task. For this task participants will be told that after each message they will see a cue on the screen that instructs them to \"please sit still and think about the message you just heard\" and then will be prompted to complete the self-report measures. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions and then will listen to each radio message. After completing self-report measures for the last message participants will be thanked and dismissed.\\nTime table\\nData for this experiment will be collected by the end of February 2002. Data analysis will be completed by the end of March 2002. References\\n\\nBoster, F.J., & Mongeau, P. (1984). Fear-arousing persuasive messages. In R.N. Bostrom & B.H. Westley (Eds.)

This re-emergence of women\\x92s sections is especially interesting within a feminist context since it was during the late 1960s and early 1970s, during a particularly active period of feminism, that newspapers first eliminated these gendered sections and started producing lifestyle pages aimed at a general audience.

Flock Theory draws from a theoretical basis of emergence and self-organizing systems (Contractor, 1994; Hodgson, 2000; Monge & Contractor, 2001; Monge & Eisenberg, 1987). Likewise, two other important theoretical works are offered, Eric Eisenberg\\x92s work on the transcendent organization of jamming (Eisenberg, 1990), and R. Keith Sawyers\\x92 work on the Emergence of Creativity (Sawyer, 1999). Catalyzed by a computer graphic simulation of a flock of birds by Craig Reynolds (Reynolds, 1987), and conceived to model jazz improvisation, Flock Theory is presented axiomatically. Focusing on the optimization of group members\\x92 distance, the maintenance of leadership, and matching of direction of other individuals, this theory poses a model of human interaction that captures the potentially egalitarian effects of a cooperative evolution.

Surprisingly, they have difficulty in making clear what it really is that they manage and what their consultations truly represent, what aims they have and what strategies they use. In this paper I present a model consisting of basic communication strategies, derived from communication theory and rooted in described public relations approaches in the Netherlands.\\nThe theoretical constructed and empirically clarified communication models-in-use revealed a typology of seven public relations approaches. From the point of view of communication theory, three of these models cannot be taken seriously. However, there is no empirical or logical evidence that any of the remaining four theory-based communication models alone could outclass the other three models. In the final section of this paper, I propose, therefore, to go beyond the limiting traditional practical public relations borders and view these four models as being a composite of complementary basic communication strategies in public relations practice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Outside Waco, Texas, on April 19th, 1993, a 51-day standoff between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and David Koresh and the Branch Davidians concluded with a fire that killed more than 75 people inside the Davidian compound. Despite the fact that the FBI negotiators talked on the telephone with Koresh or his spokesperson almost every day, the negotiators were unable to bring the standoff to a peaceful end. A frustrating yet persistent aspect of the FBI negotiations was the Davidians\\x92 talk about the Bible and their religious beliefs. In this study, I analyze several exchanges between Koresh and various negotiators. The analysis shows how different reframing practices reveal the interactional troubles the negotiators faced in dealing with the incompatibility of their frame for the situation with the Davidians\\x92 religious one. These practices, I argue, shed new light on the generic advice currently provided for crisis negotiators.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although the framing of public opinion has often been conceptualized as a collective and social process, experimental studies of framing have typically examined only individual, psychological responses to alternative message-frames. In this research, we employ for the first time group conversations as the unit of analysis (following Gamson, 1992) in an experimental study of framing effects. Two hundred and forty-one American citizens in 54 groups (18 homogeneously conservative groups, 17 homogeneously liberal, and 19 heterogeneous groups) discussed whether or not gay and lesbian partnerships should be legally recognized. Groups were randomly assigned to one of two framing conditions (a \\x93homosexual marriage / special rights\\x94 frame or a \\x93civil union / equal rights\\x94 frame). Results indicated framing effects that were, in all cases, contingent on the ideological leanings of the group. The \\x93marriage\\x94 frame tended to polarize group discussions along ideological lines. Both liberal and conservative groups appeared to find their opponents\\x92 frame more provocative, responding to them with a larger number of statements and expressing greater ambivalence than when reacting to more hospitable frames.',\n",

What is the role of the press in promoting and policing this consensus? This paper examines the performance of news media in Malaysia, where militant cells have recently been uncovered, prompting the use of security laws that permit lengthy detention without trial. The coverage of one of the largest establishment newspapers, The New Straits Times, is compared with that of an independent website, Malaysiakini.com. Consistent with research elsewhere, the mainstream press is found to be generally unsympathetic towards perceived breaches of order. The New Straits Times framed the affair mainly in national security terms. Malaysiakini, in contrast, expressed a concern for civil liberties, and the possibility that the government was exploiting the war against terrorism to crack down on peaceful political dissent. The study highlights the importance of the alternative press in keeping key debates open at times when there is pressure on the news media to support the state\\x92s agenda.',\n",

It also conveys the ways in which music genres such as Detroit Techno are influenced by social and/or political histories. I also argue that while rave culture was in a sense killed by commercialization and popular media coverage, branches of EDM that have developed independently of the rave scene, such as Detroit Techno, continue to thrive. Moreover, my analysis of popular media highlights the impact that popular press coverage can have on a culture, such as the negative drug related coverage of the rave scene or the Detroit Free Press's positive depictions of DEMF. I use Bakhtinian concepts pertaining to the connections between ourselves and others, along with Bakhtin's description of the purposes and offerings of carnival life, to develop a theoretical understanding of the underpinnings of EDM. Finally, I suggest that unlike the space of the rave or carnival, after which everything goes back to normal, the experience of festivals such as the Detroit Electronic Music Festival have the potential to revitalize and build community in Detroit.\",\n",

While portrayals of the movement and its members shifted in complex ways, the traditional \"protest paradigm\" emphasizing violence and deviance persists; however, this analysis suggests that the movement was further mainstreamed-rather than newly marginalized-after September 11, 2001. The results suggest that coverage of dissent is driven more by news values such as novelty, violence, and local bias than by ideological, intellectual or professional learning curves among journalists.',\n",

By comparing the domain name dispute resolution system and the ways in which it was established and operated with the historical analysis of the Wild West, it attempts to describe the cyberspace governance as a particular kind of communication system that arises out of a particular kind of situation, which I characterize in this article as frontier conditions. The emergence and disappearance of the Wild West as the frontier and free land has great significance in American history. Cyberspace is yet another frontier, a new, unlimited space. As in the American West, people go into this new space and try to obtain domain space for their interests. And attempts for self-governance again contribute to the establishment of a new system that force people in cyberspace to comply. As a result of this new system of compliance, extreme commercialization of cyberspace is supported at the expense of interests of individuals, and the new frontier of cyberspace is ironically placed under the most centralized control. The myth of freedom and the romantic notion of self-regulation and self-governance do not seem to be so valid both in the West and in cyberspace. Evolving from the circumstances characterized by the frontier conditions defined in this article was rather a system of coercion and compliance.',\n",

Second, we wanted to know what people motivated to participate in a LAN event. The survey among 176 LAN gamers showed that they were almost exclusively male, with a mean age of 19.5 years. The gamers devoted about 2.6 hours each day to their hobby, which is far more than found in other studies among gamers. They were particularly motivated by social motives, and to a lesser extent by a need to know more about games (interest motive). The competition motive obtained a low overall score, although it was more prominent among a subgroup of \\x91heavy gamers\\x92.

Discussions with family members appear to be key to transforming the wishes of the individual into an actual organ donation. Gender differences have been noted in terms of both attitudes toward organ donation and responses to donation messages. The present study investigated gender differences in conversations with family members about organ donation, finding that males are less likely to have such conversations and, when such conversations do occur, are less likely to include within them topics of conversation that are associated with more positive responses from family members. Speculation is offered about the reasons for these gender differences and suggestions are made about communicative strategies to more effectively convince males to both donate their organs and to talk to family members about donation.',\n",

Femininity and masculinity were positively associated with most communication values, and mediated most of the observed sex differences.',\n",

To investigate this topic, a content analysis was conducted on a sample of adolescents' home pages (N=241).

       "  'abstract': 'The gender-linked language effect demonstrates that men and women differ in their language use which results in different evaluative outcomes for communicators. Individuals using prototypical male language are judged to be more dynamic than individuals using prototypical female language, whereas individuals using prototypical female language are judged to be more aesthetically pleasing and socio-intellectual than individuals using prototypical male language. Despite the consistent support for the construct, there is no clear theoretical account of the gender-linked language use differences that determine, in large part, the gender-linked language effect. As such, this research offers an initial step towards a theoretical account of gender-linked language use. Utilizing self-categorization theory, the current research examines the effects of sex, chronic gender identity accessibility (i.e., gender schematicity), and gender identity salience on gender-linked language use. Sex, gender schematicity, and gender identity salience were expected to have effects on gender-linked language use independently and interactively. However, results confirmed interactive effects only. Specifically, men and women use prototypical gender-linked language only when they are gender schematic and have a salient gender identity. When gender identity is not salient individuals use language prototypical of the opposite gender group. The results are discussed regarding previous research on gender-linked language use, the nature of gender identity salience with regards to the ostensibly conflictual gender-as-culture and dominance hypotheses, and the need to examine gender-linked language under a variety of contextual factors.',\n",

Using a mixed-model factorial design, zero-history participants (n = 48) were grouped into dyads and asked to cooperate on low- and high-equivocality tasks over a series of three meetings conducted on three consecutive days. Results indicate that relational intimacy increased over time, but a significant interaction with medium and subsequent analyses reveal that this was only true for the CMC condition. Task type also interacted with time, but it did not have a significant effect on relational intimacy, nor did it interact with medium. Similarly, there was no main effect for either participant gender or group composition, nor did these factors interact with medium. The findings provide some support for the hyperpersonal communication model (Walther, 1996), which predicts that, under certain circumstances, interpersonal relationships can develop in CMC to a greater extent than they can in FTF interactions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The transformation of community values and objectives through exposure to foreign programming remains a primary concern for several media observers. However, an analysis along unilinear lines cannot explain the ramifications of global media\\x92s entry into areas previously protected from such forces. Deeply institutionalized domestic values may manifest in the new competitive environment as global media strive to become a platform for local expression. I show this by examining the national cohesion, an objective considered essential goal for a modern-state. Historically, national media participated by providing a practical channel for diffusing this value. The current opening of this national communicative space to global players appears to present a significant threat to this objective. As several observers note the global integrative forces increase the possibility of linkages between national communities and extra-national networks that may undermine national unity. Foreign media may also impress upon national cohesion by introducing different concepts that influence sentiments of national belonging.\\nIn multicultural India, early strategies of national development highlighted the importance of national cohesion. At the same time, several contending approaches for achieving this objective appeared on the scene. In the decades following independence in 1947, the institutionalization of this objective with its different manifestations influenced national television\\x92s infrastructural expansion and programming. Surprisingly, one finds these differing notions of national cohesion also present in the productions of diverse transnational and subregional enterprises. Furthermore, few of the transnational productions get involved in presenting different nationalisms as part of their strategy for acceptance in the new region. The state, local institutions, and the audience perform a critical role in shaping transnational strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper summarizes the findings of research conducted for the completion of a master\\x92s thesis. The study was initiated with an intuition that, in a postmodern world characterized by global capitalism and electronic mediation, the Internet substitutes the modern nation\\x96state as an arena for the maintenance of cultural distinctiveness. In the same context, it inquires about the possibilities of community formation on the Internet and the characteristics of online communities. The exemplar group used is the global community comprising People of Indian Origin (PIO). Thus, their Internet usage is observed through participant observation in two chat rooms and textual analysis of two Web portals. The study concludes that the Internet allows an offline population to create an online network and dwell in a virtual space; consequently, a representational, transnational community is created. Furthermore, a group such as the PIO can experience their cultural identity in the same sphere.',\n",

First, the globalization of local talents is found to be a precondition for this reversed cultural flow. Second, the formation of a global-local alliance, consisting of networks of both local and global firms and professionals, plays a critical role. The alliance serves to translate local cultural capital into economic capital and to enhance the transculturability of the cultural product. To be accountable to the Western agencies and to be faithful to local culture, the production team is under constant pressure to strike a balance between particularization and universalization.

What makes groups work effectively? This study reviews factors that both promote as well as obstruct effective group performance, and it focuses on one of the many factors that hinder a group\\'s ability to perform as best it can: social loafing. \"Social loafing\" is the phenomenon of individuals in group situations doing less work, putting in less effort or expending less energy on the group project than they would if they did the work alone. It is common in many different situations and research has shown that it transcends cultures. This study looked at the problem from the instructor\\'s point of view and measured the level of instructor awareness of social loafing in university classroom groups in both Japan and the United States. It hypothesized that instructors are unaware of several ways of diminishing social loafing in student groups. It also asked what, if any, preventative steps instructors take to diminish social loafing in student groups? Results showed that the vast majority of instructors on both sides of the Pacific are aware of the concepts of social loafing and free-riding. Furthermore, results support the notion that instructors should be more aware of more techniques to curb loafing and that Japanese instructors tend to take a less active role in curbing social loafing than their American counterparts. Suggestions on how teachers can curb loafing and then suggestions for research are given.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper is an historical and interpretive examination of the United States pharmaceutical industry and its mission to control public discourse and consciousness concerning health and disease via the accelerated commodification of medicine. The paper uses critical theoretical approaches to analyze the processes of mass communication and commodification, and to explain how the US based pharmaceutical industry has redefined the role it plays in the very conceptualization of disease and how these rationalized practices undermine the conventional doctor-patient dynamic. The recent commodification and popularity of psychoactive drugs is provided as an example of this process. Over the past twenty years the pharmaceutical industry has established itself as a $400 billion per-year business. It has done so largely through the creation of demand for its products. Similar to the American media conglomerate in perpetual search of the transnational \"Blockbuster\" cinematic or tele-visual sensation, Big Pharma\\'s ability to exert control over research and development, marketing, and, increasingly, the definitions of dis-ease, is central to the industry\\'s growth as a capitalist enterprise. Not coincidentally the industry has, by way of sophisticated means of mediated representation, made momentous gains in interceding in the doctor-patient relationship. It further acts to define popular meanings of illness while proffering commodified biotechnological remedies. By manipulating specific conceptualizations of popular discourse on health the industry may create and predict the demand for its products. This discussion also provides readers with specific examples of how the for-profit media and advertising industries function and the specific interests they serve.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Globalization and identity are two most vigorously debated terms in the modern critical studies. In order to look at the ways in which politics of identity is involved in globalization and localization, this paper discusses about the recent scene of Korean popular music focusing on the concept of mobility. More specific consideration will be given to the recent controversy about so-called ¡®a group of salmon,¡¯ referring to those musicians who revisit their mother country after growing up in countries outside Korea. These second generations of Korean immigrants have flowed into Korea since the early 90s, and have been forming a big power group in Korean music industry. This paper discusses about cultural and political discourses surrounding a teen idol who decided to choose U.S. citizenship over Korean citizenship, and explores on the ways in which popular music evokes a sense of material politics of identity. Throughout the discussion, I will argue that nationalism is not a simple reactionary localism against globalization, but an aggressive negotiation among economic, cultural and political powers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Navigating the borderlands between certainty and uncertainty presents an enduring challenge to organizations and employees alike. The Uncertainty Management Matrix (UMM) juxtaposes the uncertainty management strategies of employees and organizations. The Working Climate Survey operationalizes the UMM concepts. This research project focused on analyzing the data gathered from over 1000 employees in a wide range of organizations who have completed the survey. The analyses revealed that organizations that embrace uncertainty tend to foster more employee commitment, greater job satisfaction, and less cynicism than those that avoid or suppress uncertainty. Employees in uncertainty-embracing organizations are better able to cope with change than their counterparts in uncertainty-suppressing organizations. This pattern emerged regardless of how employees rated their own uncertainty management skills. The analyses also indicated that communication practices and protocols play an important role in cultivating uncertainty-embracing organizational climates. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these and other findings.',\n",

The specific gestural (symbolic) form of the gesture can be explained by its immediate communicative function, in this case, by what was given and what was new information in it at that moment. Parts of the action that had just been depicted but were still needed (i.e., given) became smaller, or \\x93sloppier\\x94, while the new feature being depicted was larger, clearer, or otherwise emphasized.

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper, I show how very young children (between the ages of 1 and 2 ½ years) use \\x93gaze avoidance\\x94 as a method of resisting caregivers\\x92 efforts to intervene in their activities, specifically their acts of misconduct toward other children. When children hit, bite, push, or take toys away from others, caregivers routinely seek to halt their activities.

       "  'title': \"How Viewers' Process Live, Breaking, & Emotional TV News\",\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'How Viewers\\x92 Process Live, Breaking, and Emotional TV News\\nLive and breaking television news coverage has grown exponentially since the 1990s. Available time and technology, along with the economic pressure to increase ratings, have created an ideal environment for live and breaking news. Journalists intuitively believe these presentational techniques draw massive audiences seeking important information (Tuggle, Huffman, & Rosengard, 2002).\\nNews stories presented as live and breaking often contain emotional visuals. Researchers believe that negative visuals demand viewer attention in ways other visuals do not (Newhagen & Reeves, 1992). This study seeks to test the effects of both live and breaking television news on viewers\\x92 attention and memory. In addition, stories that evoke fear, anger, and disgust will be tested with the belief that each separate emotion has a different effect on information processing (Newhagen, 1998).\\nTuchman (1978) defined breaking news as non-routine or unplanned news events that are covered in the course of a news cycle. It could be a \\x93what-a-story\\x94 (Tuchman, 1973) such as a major passenger jetliner crash, or it could be a less tragic story such as a police chase. Either way, television news organizations believe that, when a story surpasses a particular newsworthiness threshold, it is necessary to inform viewers immediately of the event either by cutting into regularly scheduled programming or by interrupting the flow of a regularly scheduled newscast (Miller, 2000).\\nBreaking news is defined in this study as story that is 1) an unexpected event, 2) important, 3) labeled \\x93breaking,\\x94 and 4) unscheduled. Live news is defined in the same way, except that the news is planned and scheduled. Live news occurs within a newscast. Breaking news can occur at anytime and can interrupt planned newscasts and other scheduled programming. Conversely, traditional (routine) news are news events that are planned and likely to have already taken place.\\n\\x93Live\\x94 news presents events that are often associated with breaking news, although local TV news is replete with live news that is not \\x93breaking.\\x94 The greatest strength of live broadcasting is its immediacy (Brooks, Kennedy, Moen, & Ranly, 2001). There is a prevailing belief among newsworkers that live presentation of the news helps attract viewers (Tuggle & Huffman, 1999). There is also a common industry assumption that live coverage has a positive effect on memory for stories (Snoeijer, de Vreese, & Semetko, 2001).\\nFrom the viewers\\x92 perspective, Shoemaker (1996) suggests why we might expect that viewers process breaking and live news differently than traditional news. She proposed that viewers are predisposed to pay attention to news (most often \\x93bad\\x94 news) because we are \\x93hardwired\\x94 to respond to unexpected events in the environment. This response comes from the biological and cultural need to survey the environment for safety and curiosity. Humans attend to the unexpected and the novel because of an innate drive to know if external threats exist in the environment.\\nThe content of breaking news is overwhelmingly negative (Harrington, 1998). Thus, viewers should attend to and remember breaking news better because it is consistently bad and as the surveillance function suggests and it is in evolutionary interests to do so. The anticipation of \\x93what is going to happen next?\\x94 should increase viewer attention and thus memory for stories presented live.\\nThe interrujption of scheduled programming is a key feature of \\x93breaking\\x94news and distinguishes it from \\x93live\\x94 news. The interruption causes the story to stand out from its immediate context causing it to become the center of attention (Fiske & Taylor, 1991). Identifying a story as \\x93live\\x94 or \\x93breaking\\x94 may also contribute to the story\\x92s salience. After attention is oriented to a breaking news story, viewers prepare themselves to hear and see bad news.\\nEmotionally-laiden video, often found in breaking news and live stories, adds yet another dimension to this type of coverage. Damaging natural disasters, deadly traffic accidents, and exciting high-speed police chases are seen with regularity on TV news (Newhagen, 1998). A majority of studies show that negative messages tend to be remembered better than positive ones (Lang, Dhillon, & Dong, 1995). Studies have found negative compelling video, in general, enhances memory (Newhagen & Reeves, 1992; Lang, Newhagen, & Reeves, 1996). The subtleties of negative emotions that could possibly affect viewers\\x92 attention and memory were examined by Newhagen (1998), who found that video could elicit three primary negative emotions: anger, fear, or disgust. Images that elicited anger were best recognized (indexed as quicker RTs), followed by fear, then disgust. Newhagen reasoned that anger, as an \\x93approach\\x94 emotion, would increase memory in comparison to \\x93avoid\\x94 emotions such as fear and disgust.\\nA key issue in measuring attention and memory in research is the extent to which the cognitive processes required by a study session (in this case, watching television) and the processes required by a subsequent test (in this case, memory) match (Leshner & Coyle, 1996; Roediger, Weldon, & Challis,1989; Tulving, 1983). The secondary task reaction time is best interpreted as an index of the mental resources available at the encoding stage of processing (Lang, 2000; Lang & Basil, 1998). Recognition memory best indexes the extent to which information is encoded. Thus, the measures of attention and memory in this study both address the encoding processes of watching television news.\\nWe posit the following:\\nH1: A story labeled as \\x93breaking\\x94 will increase attention and memory.\\nH2: A story labeled as \\x93live\\x94 will increase attention and memory.\\nH3: Attention and memory will be highest for stories that contain visuals that evoke anger, followed in order by fear, then disgust.\\nRQ1: Is there an interaction between \\x93live,\\x94\\x93breaking,\\x94and emotion on attention and memory?\\nMethod\\nParticipants\\nApproximately 60 university students will be asked to watch a newscast in which the experimental manipulations will be presented.\\nDesign and independent variables\\nThe design of this within subjects experiment is a 3 (story type: traditional/live/breaking) X 3 (emotion: anger/fear/disgust) partial factorial within design. Both story type and emotion type will be within-subjects factors, but each participant will not see all nine possible combinations, but rather three. The set of combinations that a given participant will see represents a three-level between-subjects factor, which will be handled by counterbalancing. Presentation order will be handled by a Latin Square design so that each order of story-emotion combination will have an equal change of being represented.\\nDependent Measures\\nAttention will be indexed by a secondary task reaction time task. Audio tones will be synchronized to the newscasts and will be presented at random intevals. Participants will be asked to watch the newscast (primary task) and press a button (secondary task) as quickly as they can when they hear an audio tone. Memory will be tested with a visual recognition task in which participants will be asked to discriminate between targets (were present in the newscast) and foils (were not present in the newscast). Accuracy and latency of responses will be recorded.\\nStimulus Construction and Materials\\nVideotaped stories will be obtained by the researchers\\x92 professional contacts at local TV stations throughout the country and from the RTNDA archive at the researchers\\x92 home department. A videotape with approximately 30 stories depicting a wide range of live coverage will be prepared. Stories will selected for pretest that contain a video segment that includes images of destruction, injury, and suffering. The tape will be shown to approximately 30-40 undergraduate students (although two groups of students may be needed to rate stories depending on the total length of the story samples). Students will rate the stories using a pencil and paper questionnaire on three seven-point Likert-type response scales, one each for anger, fear, and disgust (Newhagen, 1998). Stories will be chosen according two categorization analytical techniques: factor analysis and comparative mean differences (e.g., stories that have mean ratings high on disgust, but low on both anger and fear would be candidates for the disgust condition).\\nThree examples of each of the three emotions will be selected for inclusion in the main study. One version of the each story will serve as the traditional story. Two additional versions of each will be created by superimposing a graphic to denote either \\x93live\\x94 or \\x93breaking news.\\x94 Stories will be edited so that they each run approximately two minutes. Each of these versions will contain video that the pretest showed to elicit either anger, fear, or disgust. Three stories that represent three combinations of story type and emotion will be edited into an already existing newscast and will appear among other, non target, stories. The entire stimulus tape will run approximately 20 minutes.\\nProcedure\\nParticipants will be asked to come to the research laboratory to participate in a study on how people watch television news. They will be told that they will watch a newscast, but first, the secondary task will be explained. Participants will be instructed to watch a newscast while monitoring the audio for a tone. When they hear a tone, they should press a button on a box attached to a computer as quickly as they can. After the entire newscast (including the three target news stories) are viewed participants will undergo a practice and the main sessions of the recognition memory task. Participants will then be debriefed and thanked.\\nEquipment\\nAudio tones and the secondary task reaction times will be generated and compiled respectively by Psyscope (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993) a psychological software program that will run on a Macintosh (G3) computer. Psyscope can generate the tones and collect the RT to +/- 1 msec. The button box will be connected to the computer. When the audio tone is sounded, the internal clock in the computer will begin.

       "  'abstract': 'This study examined whether the smile was an indicator of felt positive emotion, or simply a communicative gesture independent of emotional state. We replicated an experiment by Fridlund (1991) where we showed participants humor-inducing video clips in three conditions varying in social contact - while alone, or when they believed a friend was watching the same video in a different room, or while they were in the same room with another participant. We videotaped participants unobtrusively, and classified the smiles into nonenjoyment smiles, consisting of zygomatic major action, and enjoyment smiles, consisting of zygomatic major action plus orbicularis oculi action. We also measured their self-report of happiness. We found that unlike Fridlund (1991), the number of smiles did not vary as a function of social contact. Moreover, we found, consistent with previous work by Ekman, Davidson, & Friesen (1990), that only enjoyment smiles consistently, across all social contact conditions, correlated with self-report of happiness, whereas nonenjoyment smiles did not. These results support the finding that one type of smile is an indicator of emotional state, and suggest a more complicated relationship between smiling and communication.',\n",

The present study extends prior research on these subjects by exploring the relationship between participant ideology and attitude change in small, face-to-face groups. To test a set of hypotheses and research questions, 57 zero-history experimental groups discussed three different public problems for 30-60 minutes, and each participant completed pre- and post-discussion questionnaires. Results showed that participant ideology had a clear association with changes on specific discussion-related issues, but participants from every ideological group experienced increased differentiation of ideologically distinct attitudes. It was also found that group-level shifts in opinion were related to self-reported democratic deliberation, though not to observer ratings of deliberation. The conclusion discusses these and other findings in relation to future research and programs designed to promote public deliberation.',\n",

In contrast to the warm, enlightened, and idyllic suburb of countless other American family dramas and sitcoms, The Simpsons\\x92s Springfield is a dark zone of xenophobia, provincialism, and dysfunction, a realm where American life is satirised and held up to ridicule. However, if the family sitcom has traditionally been a major tool for exporting the American Dream and all that is supposed to be comfortable about capitalism, this paper asks what we are to make of the success of The Simpsons\\x92s anti-suburb moving across the globe. The paper mixes textual analysis with audience research of non-Americans watching The Simpsons to connect with, contribute to, and further complicate debates on cultural imperialism and Americanisation.',\n",

Analyses indicated IM users were younger, had used the Internet for a longer period, and spent more time on-line per session than their counterparts. Among IM users, significant differences in \\x93every communication\\x94 also emerged according to gender and the types of relationships maintained.

Furthermore, predictions were made about the effect of a computer technology class on students' computer self-efficacy and perceptions of computing careers. Utilizing a pretest/post test design with a non-technology class as the control group, we found that overall, computer self-efficacy was positively related to positive perceptions of a computing career. Furthermore, advanced computer users had greater efficacy but, interestingly, did not have more positive perceptions of computing careers. In terms of media use, we found that those who use media for instrumental purposes but not those who use media ritualistically are more likely to feel a greater sense of computer self efficacy. Lastly, participation in the computer technology class had a positive impact on computing self-efficacy but did not appear to effect perceptions of computing careers. Potential implications for computing technology courses and for the field are discussed.\",\n",

Based on the official survey of Internet use and demographical statistics, the author finds that the Internet is still a privilege of a small group of people. Among many demographical features, income, education and location are three influential factors of the digital divide. The paper gives the insight of the distorted relationship between these three demographical factors and Internet use. While the majority of Chinese suffers from low income and few opportunities of education and job, the majority of Internet users are people of high income and high education. The regional distribution of Internet users corresponds to resource disparity of different geographical areas. The paper further analyzes the social-economic structure and Internet policy that lead to the digital divide. The paper suggests that, to bridge the digital divide, the Chinese government has to work out a way balancing economic development and human development in terms of Internet policy.',\n",

Its attractions for political communication scholars, as well as its problems, are grounded in its location at the borderlands between methods, commonly characterized as the qualitative/ quantitative divide. As the idea of framing has been pulled out of the critical/cultural studies tradition, some researchers have tried to fashion frame analysis based on traditional quantitative techniques. But to lift framing completely out of the qualitative context in which it evolved is to irreparably hollow out its usefulness as a concept for approaching an understanding of mass communication as a total environment. If the cultural connections to hegemony that are the core of the concept were consistently maintained as the foundation of research into frames at whatever level was of interest, many of the supposed problems of frame analysis would simply fade away.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nThe relationship between the psychobiological model of personality types (psychoticism, extraversion, and neuroticism) devised by Eysenck & Eysenck (1985) and Internet use and usage motives was examined. A sample of 210 undergraduate students were asked to report on their motives for using the Internet and how often they engaged in a variety of Internet and web-based activities. The findings demonstrate distinctive patterns of Internet use and usage motives for those of different personality types. Specifically, those scoring high in neuroticism reported using the Internet to feel a sense of \\x93belonging\\x94 and to be informed. Extraverts rejected the communal aspects of the Internet, and made more instrumental and goal-oriented use of Internet services. Finally, those scoring high in psychoticism demonstrated an interest in more deviant, defiant, and sophisticated Internet applications. Implications of the findings as well as suggestions for future research are included.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"This study examines the degree to which four types of communication patterns - allocution, consultation, registration, and conversation - are present on the Web sites of the ten major political parties during the political campaign prior to the Dutch national elections held on May 15, 2002. The four communication patterns, derived from Bordewijk and Van Kaam's (1984; 1986) typology of information traffic, may have application and value during a political campaign. Although Internet is very much a consultative medium, where people can find whatever they want, but have to search for it actively, more allocutive or transmissional and registrative elements will be found. Because of the political function these Web sites have, special attention is given to the degree of conversation, which can be oriented toward political deliberation and discourse. In a content analysis of Dutch party Web sites, conducted two weeks before the elections, and one week before the assassination of the frontman of one of the parties, the degree to which these types of communication are present is examined. Based on previous studies on the use of the Internet by political parties in the Netherlands, it is anticipated that the types of communication present on the Web sites differ considerably between the political parties. It is hypothesized that left/progressive parties are more inclined to use conversational types of communication on the Web, whereas right/conservative parties will use allocutive/transmissional types of communication. This hypothesis receives support from the data. Another hypothesis, that the amount of effort that has to be put in maintaining the Web site is positively correlated by the degree to which the party depends on a volatile or new electorate, is falsified.\",\n",

Our understanding of how humans engage the products of those efforts, however, is far from complete. One variable that highlights the potential contrast between the rapid development of media technology and the more gradual pace of human evolution is the notion of context instability. Context instability refers to the degree to which media content depicts different locations in time or space in succession, e.g., 21st century Harlem and 19th century Bolivia in adjacent frames. After explicating why this variable should be related to individual memory for content, this paper presents nationally representative data from a public health campaign intended for U.S. adolescents as evidence. Both the measurement of context instability in health advertisements and the demonstrated relationship between context instability and memory are noteworthy for health communication scholars.',\n",

Timing and spacing thus consist of creating and re-producing what could be called organizational closures, that is, spatiotemporal limits that indicate when and where specific organizational episodes are initiated, fulfilled and sanctioned. Organizational spaces and times are thus achieved and delineated through interactions, a phenomenon that will be illustrated through the in-depth analysis of a radio-transmission that involved police officers trying to locate and rescue one of their colleagues.',\n",

The study identifies key characteristics of the coverage and initially investigates influences shaping the coverage. The study suggests that, in the majority of countries studied, EU politics is marginal in national television news and that EU officials are virtually absent from the news. However, when the EU is covered, EU politics is more prominent than other political news. Three influences were found to positively contribute to the amount and prominence of EU news: it was more prominent in public broadcasting news programs, in countries with higher levels of public satisfaction with democracy and in countries with polarized elite opinion about the EU. Similarly, the visibility of EU officials in television news was highest in public news programs, even when controlling for the potentially mediating factor of amount of news about the EU. The findings suggest that, with EU coverage being of invisible importance and without protagonists, the Europeanization of television news coverage is rather wishful thinking than reality.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Intercultural communication competence (ICC) is an area of study that is becoming more relevant in the increasingly multicultural communities that we live in. Though much progress has been made in this area of research since Hall (1959), a satisfactory model of ICC and a scale that translates well into different cultures is yet to be developed. This paper presents a review of past research in ICC and describes an exploratory study that is an initial attempt at identifying variables that contribute towards perceived ICC. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews with participants representing fifteen different countries and responses were analyzed using semantic network analysis. A definition of intercultural communication was derived from the responses, and knowledge and motivation were identified as important components of ICC. Limitations of the study and implications for future research are discussed.',\n",

The underlying premise is that public relations is a culturally bound practice that will functionally differ depending on the originating country, but which also must take into account the cultural norms and expectations of target audiences.\\nThe coding instrument measures dialogic function (i.e., how open and interactive); how easy the site is to navigate; what features are supplied to journalists to help build the media agenda; and how well issues of communicating across cultural boundaries and expectations are addressed. Many results were unexpected and suggest Middle Eastern practitioners are relying on a personal relations model that takes advantage of the lack of a media gatekeeper on the web but not of the web's media agenda-building capacities.\",\n",

It is attempting to transition from a traditional, American-oriented student newspaper into one that reflects the wide diversity of the student body on campus, both in content and style. The transition has been accompanied by practical problems and intercultural/philosophical difficulties. Of most immediate concern is the problem of agreeing what news is and what newspapers ought to be for a multicultural audience. The objective of the present paper, which is written by the newspaper¡¦s advisor, is to provide insight into possibilities and problems involved with questioning traditional definitions of news in training future journalists. Specifically, this paper examines the gap and tension between increasing the multicultural emphasis of the newspaper and sustaining operations in the newsroom. This paper discusses the program curriculum, news value decisions, the information gathering process, the hiring process, and general challenges of diversity issues in a student newspaper.',\n",

Based on such critique, this study performed qualitative research of the university students¡¯ diverse instant messaging (IM) usage behaviors and attitudes. As hyperpersonal interaction perspective predicted, students had high degree of interpersonal interaction through IM. However, the degree of the interpersonal interaction experienced by students varied depending on how they perceived and used IM, from considering IM as a casual communication channel to using it as a relationship management or filtering tool.

       "  'abstract': 'Scholarship in organizational change studies has offered many models of phases or stages through which organizational members progress as they arrive at a change. In this traditional perspective, change is the exception to the ordinarily stagnant state of organizational life. An alternative is to reverse the analytic point of interest between static organization and change--to assume change and the ubiquitous dynamic nature of organization and to examine how organization is an attempt at freezing meaning. Taking a discourse perspective, this essay argues that organizational change occurs, in part, in the performance of intertextuality, or the repeated voices of other organizational members. Three kinds of intertextuality are discussed: voices of past speech, voices of absent speech, and voices of future speech. Through the incorporation of other voices into their own, members make translations between organizational practices, identities, and utterances. It is this translation practice that allows organizational change to be conceptualized as a shift in the ways that people talk.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The European Union (EU) has sought to free up its common internal broadcasting market, while guarding against media concentration, with the aim of promoting media pluralism and cultural diversity. Member States have harmonized their national broadcasting policies with transfrontier EU directives. Likewise, post-communist Central and Eastern Europe countries (CEECs) that desire EU membership have aligned their broadcasting policies with EU directives. The case study reported here looks at five candidate CEECs that have created the competitive markets for broadcasting envisioned by the EU: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia. Until the end of the 1980s the broadcasting systems in these five countries were monopolies controlled by the states. Ten years later dual systems of public and commercial broadcasting were in place. This report examines the influence of the EU\\'s cultural and audiovisual policies, particularly the \"Television Without Frontiers\" (TWF) Directive, on changes in the candidate countries\\' domestic broadcasting policies and institutions. The research employed quantitative and qualitative methodologies, triangulating historical documents, existing statistical data, and interviews with key players involved in the accession negotiation process. The results illustrate the typology of positive, negative, and framing integration described by Knill and Lehmkill (1999) and apply Börzel and Risse\\'s (2000) \"logics\" of domestic change. The conclusion raises questions about the appropriateness of the economic measures used in the screening process to determine whether TWF promotes cultural diversity in the candidate countries. Alternative methods from communication research traditions, such as textual analysis and audience studies, are suggested to measure cultural diversity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Supreme Court\\'s finding in Cohen v. Cowles Media Co. in 1991 that tort actions under generally applicable laws raise no First Amendment issues when used to recover damages for the press\\'s newsgathering tactics has created confusion in the lower courts and increased liability for aggressive newsgathering. Liability has been found to attach to the media even when stories served the public interest by uncovering corporate wrongdoing. This paper argues that the press should vigorously challenge the assumptions behind Cohen that the press has no more First Amendment rights than the general public. The press also should force the courts to confront the inconsistencies created by broad First Amendment protection for expression but little or no protection for information gathering. The paper also argues that another generally applicable law - the \"tester\\'s privilege\" - may hold hope as an effective defense against tort actions over undercover newsgathering techniques.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Mounting evidence suggests that the transition from casual to serious involvement coincides with increased conflict and emotional negativity within romantic relationships; we argue that this turbulence is also manifest in people's appraisals of irritating relationship circumstances. In addition, we identify relational uncertainty and interference from partners as mechanisms that may explain why people attribute heightened degrees of severity and relationship threat to irritations occurring at moderate levels of intimacy. We conducted a cross-sectional study in which individuals evaluated potential irritations that had recently occurred in their dating relationship. As predicted, appraisals were (a) curvilinearly associated with intimacy, and (b) positively associated with both relational uncertainty and interference from partners. Contrary to our expectations, neither relational uncertainty nor interference from partners mediated the curvilinear trajectory between appraisals and intimacy. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the functions and foundations of appraisals of irritating circumstances within dating relationships.\",\n",

A cross-sectional survey of 356 undergraduates at a large, midwestern university was conducted. Exposure to sexually objectifying magazines, but not television, predicted self-objectification. Also, self-objectification mediated the relationship between exposure to sexually objectifying magazines and self-consciousness during physical intimacy and sexual interest.

The three target members that this study is aimed at have two things in common: they are Asian males respectively from South Korea, Vietnam, and Thailand; and they are apparently less aggressive and more passive when compared with the other nine members. The actions of being involved and participating in discussions are found in three forms: producing involvement tokens, waiting for legitimate speech-turn allocation, and ineffective speech-turn intents.\\n\\nThis study discusses why members from these three Asian countries use these three forms of classroom action in a group format. In addition, the results of this study assert the essence of intercultural competence when sensitivities and adaptabilities of cultural differences between oneself and the other interacting participants are involved. Instead of learning to be aggressive and active during multicultural exchanges and abandoning the learned ways of communication, competent communicators can still maintain their own styles and render their communication goals at the same time.',\n",

Although computer-based characters are now able to express basic human emotions, they cannot yet automatically and intelligently adapt their emotional expressions to the changing context.

A 2 x 2 mixed-design experiment (happy vs. sad expression of a character by happy vs. sad context) (N=24) was conducted with a computer-based character presenting happy and sad novels to participants.

Israelis treasure their rich history of Judaism; value education; respect those who are technologically ingenious and are fascinated by popular culture messages from the visual media of television, film and the Internet. But what happens in elementary school, during the students\\x92 formative years, when Jewish values taught daily often conflict with popular culture messages communicated from the Internet? How do educators along with their students evaluate Internet messages? Do the various educational streams from secular to Modern Orthodox differ in their approach to teaching and using the Internet?\\nThis paper examines the extent to which Israeli Jewish education at the elementary school level particularly the State-religious \\x96 the Modern-Orthodox\\x92s Mamlachti-Dati schools - utilize computers and the Internet and encourage popular culture in their classrooms. Qualitative interviews were conducted with educators primarily from the Official-State education streams - Mamlachti-Dati schools, Mamlachti-secular and the Tali religiously enriched schools.\\nThe findings of this pilot study indicate that the degree that Jewish values emanate from religious education influenced teachers and administrators\\x92 approaches to Internet Technology. Educators from secular streams pursued the technology aggressively, while those from traditional streams were more cautious.

Efforts to reconstruct these borders, dissolve or even eliminate them through peace building efforts have proven difficult. One such effort, Palestinian Israeli Sesame Street, has found those borders to be too deep to transcend. Recently, the series, which began its first season in 1998 has decided to chart a new course. Its' second season will treat those borders as something that cannot be penetrated, rather than as it treated them during its' first season, as something constructed. Adults have deemed the series to be too far removed from reality and hence not something to which children in the region should be exposed. My interviews with Israeli-Jewish children during the months of November and December of 2001, however, tell a different story. Children, in contrast to their adult decision makers, want the show to continue in its original format. They use the show as a means for taking time-out from the conflict raging around them.\",\n",

First, it will discuss the issues that usually come up for teachers who are non-native speakers of English, some of which may or may not be applicable to the current situation. From these, the relevant ones will be discussed in more detail, punctuated with examples from the faculty's experiences. Then it will go into the areas of concern regarding teaching a multicultural group which is composed of at least three countries. Among the topics are: the burden on the teacher to adjust to a variety of cultures and English levels, the teaching methodology which may be quite different from the one that each nationality is used to, and the complexities of the socio-cultural relationships of the students within the classroom setting. Finally, it will focus on the particular points pertaining to the advantages and disadvantages of being a Non-Native English Speaking student in a multicultural setting.\\nThe objective of this paper is to show that there are more advantages to learning English in a multicultural setting than in a setting where all the learners are from the same culture and share the same language.\",\n",

Trying to rescue Marxist communication studies from the ¡§jungle of idealism,¡¨ Dallas W. Smythe called for the analysis of demand management in monopoly capitalism with the focus upon the triangular relationship among the audience, the media, and the advertisers. However, this study engages in the ¡§blindspot¡¨ debate by asking the following questions: Do class processes really occur in mass media? If they do, who are the workers, how do they get paid, and what kind of commodity has been produced and sold? These questions, as Smythe expects, are still in dispute. Based upon Wolff and Resnick¡¦s overdeterminist logic of Marxist theory, this study reconceptualizes the audience commodity as fictitious, betting on the future exploitation of labor, and the commercial television economy as credit-sustained accumulation. The production and circulation of the audience as fictitious capital are constrained by changing labor-capital relationship, whereas its normalization and institutionalization are produced by particular regime of truth. In the final section, eight propositions are put forward to demonstrate the critical tendencies as well as the possible transformations of a credit-sustained communication system.',\n",

This paper highlights the usefulness of fictional television relationships for adolescent sexual identity formation by examining Dawson\\x92s Creek for its construction of gay character Jack McPhee. Jack\\x92s sexual identity is constructed and modified through dialectical tensions in his relationship with Jen Lindley, ultimately allowing him to express sexual identity in terms of acceptance rather than in terms of political or legal rights. This difference in narrative form illuminates potential differences between the formation of adult and adolescent sexual identity. Based on ethnographic work on gay men and their use of fictional media combined with a close reading of Dawson\\x92s Creek for sexual identity construction, the paper ultimately argues that fictional representations could serve as a template from which gay adolescents enact personal relationships. It also calls for critical media scholars to examine positive aspects of representations, by examining the politics involved in this particular representation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study was a methodological inquiry into the significance of redefining the ingroup and outgroup distinction. Specialists in the Japanese culture often note that a mere two category definition of relational intimacy does not suffice in describing Japanese interpersonal relationships. This study featured direct and indirect communication strategy preference across six situations, toward four targets based on intimacy level. A total of 279 students in Japanese universities participated in the questionnaire survey. A 6 x 4 mixed design MANOVA was conducted, with 6 direct/indirect strategies as dependent variables. Results indicated that direct strategies were preferred for the most intimate in-ingroup (miuchi) targets, while indirect strategies were preferred most for in-outgroup targets (seken). The relationship between strategy preference and intimacy was linear in nature with bluntly direct communication, but curvilinear with polite and indirect communication strategies. From this, it was apparent that a mere ingroup-outgroup distinction is inadequate, and that a four-level target intimacy classification is essential in observing communication styles of Japanese.',\n",

During everyday newswork, they apply a professional narrative that represents journalistic pressures as well as those from their work world: this results in a greater degree of \\x93chronicle\\x94 news. During a crisis situation such as a terrorist act, in contrast, journalists switch to master narratives that help restore a culture\\x92s identity when its core tenets are under threat: news becomes more of a story form in this case, often relying on enduring mythologies.\\n\\nThese master narratives also vary by the cultural proximity of the occurrence being reported on. Culturally proximate events trigger more specific master narratives, while less proximate events deal with broader cultural understandings that require more complex story-telling.\\n\\nThis study is a comparative work examining two terrorist acts in Israel as covered by major newspapers in the U.S. and Israel. Textual analysis is applied to news items from these newspapers to detect master narratives and explore how master narratives depend on how an occurrence relates to the culture reporting on it.\\n\\nWe found that occurrences with greater cultural proximity were covered with a greater degree of chronicle form than less proximate occurrences, although the story form of news narrative was common to this news reporting in both cases. In each case, the master narratives applied represented central values of a society.

The focus of the method is visual imagery and involves the subjects in an intensive introspection process in which they attempt to express their experiences by making drawings that symbolize the key aspects of their sojourn. This procedure is followed by discussion and analysis of the drawing with the subject interpreting the symbols and images as they feel appropriate. The method has proved effective in helping the subject to explore issues at a level beyond that which could be achieved in an interview setting. Its chief advantage lies in that it allows the subject to express their experiences without the need to work in a second language, at least in the initial stages. Overall, this method would appear to have an importance as a significant way of developing insights into the experience of acculturation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The foundation of a democracy rests on public support and a reasonably broad distribution of knowledge. The mass media traditionally have been assigned with providing much of that knowledge through their surveillance and watchdog functions. However, media do not inform all citizens equally, and mass communication scholars have long studied the threat represented by the knowledge gap phenomenon first identified by Tichenor, Olien and Donohue (1970) and confirmed in more recent analyses (Gaziano, 1997; Viswanath & Finnegan, 1996). That gap is premised on differential print media use by low and high status groups, but the most recent arrival to the media environment--the Internet-leads us to re-examine the relationship between media use and acquisition of public affairs knowledge. Three types of knowledge-about international affairs, about the local community, and about the Internet-are examined in relation to media use, including the Internet, in a telephone survey conducted in a Midwest metropolitan area. Results confirm gaps in all three types of knowledge by high/medium/low education and income groups. Similarly, differences in international public affairs knowledge are found for levels of newspaper readership and \"tenure\" on the Internet. A community knowledge gap is found for newspaper readership but not time on the Internet, while an Internet knowledge gap is found for years on the Internet but not for newspaper readership. Examining the full range of information, we find positive relationships between several media use variables and the overall media use index and the individual and summary knowledge measures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Zen Buddhism is known to attach great importance to the traditional notion of ¡°No dependence on words and letters¡± and ¡°a special transmission outside the teachings.¡± Assuming this heritage, many ancient Zen masters in China and Japan are recorded to have adopted illogical use of language in their communication with disciples. Research has been done to interpret the nature and role of language in Zen discourse. Olson (2000) claims that in Zen Buddhism, language assumes an ancillary position to experience. A number of other studies define Zen experience as either transcending or denying language. Still others discuss Zen discourse in relation to mysticism. These interpretations and approaches, insightful and valuable as they are, are limited in that they fall short of specificity.\\nMy central contention is that the nature and role of language in Zen discourse are best understood essentially within its religious context of mysticism, with particular attention to its communicative and ritual dimensions. My approach to this issue is to focus on koan, as it ¡°may be the most condensed and self-conscious linguistic practice ever devised in any culture,¡± (Wright, 1989, p. 81) thus epitomizing the essential characteristics of Zen discourse. So, a better strategy to understand the nature and role of language in koan consists of the notion of koan as a communication act and the ritualistic dimension of koan. With this approach as the starting point, a more appropriate understanding of language in koan and Zen discourse can be achieved.',\n",

As this form of television became more popular in the 1990s, programs evolved to serve a variety of additional audiences and created new genres of talk television. One of the programs emerging out of this time was \"Politically Correct,\" a discussion-based television talk show mixing humor with current political issues. This paper looks at a series of episodes of \"Politically Incorrect\" to gain a better understanding the ways in which discussion panel members discursively navigate between the immediate panel members and the larger audience. Analyzing talk television using discourse analysis adds to the understanding of mass communication at the level in which participants engage. This study explores multiple ways in which Goffman\\x92s (1967) concept of footing contributes to understanding of this show.

The second goal was to explore the role of motivation in learning from interactive media. I proposed that extrinsic motivation might explain differing results of media learning research in the fields of education and mass communication.\\nResults of hypothesis testing were heavily dependent on which measure of learning was employed. A traditional multiple-choice test of recognition verified an effect of motivation but not of interactive behavior. A comprehension measure of learning, supported by the cognitive constructivism theory of learning employed in this study, supported an effect of interactivity but not of motivation. An interaction between motivation and interactivity was also verified by the comprehension measure.\\nExplanations for the findings are proposed and implications for mass communicators discussed.',\n",

This study draws upon the literatures of epistolary critique, visual meaning and metaphor, and rhetorical criticism to explore the rhetorical device of framing ads as letters. We utilize the triadic classification system of Charles Sanders Peirce to classify the letters-as-ads into either iconic, indexical or symbolic frames. Our initial assumption that more graphically iconic ads would rely less on textual metaphor, and vice versa, was confirmed.

       "  'title': 'Life on the Texas-Mexico Border: Myth and reality as represented in Mainstream and Independent Western Cinema',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Film scholars generally agree that with few exceptions, representations of Latinos in mainstream films in the United States have been limited to narrow stereotypes since the earliest days of film. (Berumen, 1995; Keller, 1985; Pettit, 1980). Most often, Latino actors were typecast into roles in the formula Western and crime dramas so popular with United States audiences, depicting the foil for the \"American\" hero. The roles were clear: those on the United States side of the border were the \"good guys,\" those on the Mexico side of the border were generally not. Even rarer than a rich role for Latinos was a film that tried to address the topic of the Latino experience in the United States.\\nIn mainstream films on the Latino experience, the topic was most often urban crime or the \"problem of illegal immigration.\" (Keller, 1985). A few mainstream films attempted to examine illegal Mexican immigration into the United States-indocumentado pictures-but were little more than formula treatments of complex issues. Most notable of these films are \"Borderline\" (1980) with Charles Bronson and \"The Border\" (1981) with Jack Nicholson and Harvey Keitel. Based on standard narrative formulas, these films could be termed mediocre, at best. Of the few films that tried to go beyond surface treatments of border issues, those that enjoyed the most critical success (although little commercial success) were independently produced films such as \"Alambrista!\" (1976) and \"El Norte\" (1983).\\nEven fewer films have tackled the complex topic of how people living on both sides of the United States-Mexico border negotiate cultural, political and economic identities. But this neglect of border issues doesn\\'t mean that the area was not portrayed in films - only that the portrayals followed \"form.\" In U.S. films, the predominant images of border towns were (and are) negative and stereotypical-the dusty town plaza dotted with loitering Mexicans, glaring from under their sombreros, waiting to indiscriminately rob any Anglo naive enough to enter their primitive, lawless territory.\\nThe tendency towards shallow characterizations and formula narratives is not limited to minority groups and border areas, but is standard practice in the Hollywood film industry, which takes few risks and employs a narrow range of narrative structures and the attendant roles that are easily identifiable by filmgoers. Portraying a character in a stereotypical manner, what Hall (1997) describes as reducing \"people to a few, simple essential characteristics,\" allows viewers to quickly grasp the character\\'s motives, social and educational status, and familial background. But these stereotypes are not neutral - they have the power to set up a symbolic frontier \"between the \\'normal\\' and the \\'deviant\\'... between \\'insiders\\' and \\'outsiders\\'...\" Stereotypes are not dictated by the medium, however, and Williams (1985) argues that films with rich representations can be \"illuminating,\" especially for Anglo members of the audience. The power of these films lies in their refusal to revert to individualize the case, the refusal to create \"exceptions,\" but to instead represent members of all cultural groups in relation to each other, not just within the context of their own \"group.\"\\nAlthough conventional wisdom dictates that typical audiences will not tolerate films deviating from \"tried and true\" formulas, in the 1990s two award-winning independent films about citizens living near the Mexico and U.S. borders broke through to mainstream distribution and were embraced by Western audiences. With vivid images and compelling narratives, these two films, \"El Mariachi\" (1993) and \"Lone Star\" (1996), urged viewers to consider the Texas/New Mexico border in new ways-as contested spaces where different ethnic groups with ties to the region try to resolve conflicts over cultural, technological, and geographical boundaries.\\nAlthough the two films offer starkly different narratives, each compelled viewers to reconsider the complex cultural conflicts that have their roots in past centuries but are being played out as the United States and Mexico struggle to redefine border areas in light of the new \"global order.\" Nowhere is that struggle more evident than in the towns that dot the border between the United States and Mexico, and each of these films, \"El Mariachi\" and \"Lone Star,\" begged viewers to dig deep into their stored memories and amend them to fit this new reality.\\nIn this new reality, the men in white hats are not always the heroes, history is gradually being cast in a different light, geographical borders do not delineate cultural and familial loyalties, and \"Third World\" residents struggle to take advantage of economic and technological opportunities without allowing their social order to be erased in the process.\\nA historical brief on film representations of Latino/as and U.S. Mexico border\\nAlthough this paper is not designed to address specifically the representation of Latinos in film, a discussion of the U.S./Mexico border in film cannot be addressed without explaining to some degree how Latino/as have been portrayed. As Crouteau and Haynes (2000) note, in the United States media, Whites have defined the \"norm\" and all other ethnic groups have been measured against this norm. A prime example is \"Bordertown,\" which appears on first glance to be an assimilation narrative, but the narrative \"maps\" Others in relation to the mainstream. \"Mexican-Americans are marginal, Mexican nationals more so, and Chinese Americans even more so\" (Berg, 1992). The images of the Border cannot be separated from the images of Latinos, and both are presented in Western film from the \"American\" point of view.\\nThe earliest movie depictions of Latino/as and Border areas, according to Keller (1985) were \"an almost unrelieved exercise in degradation.\" Early film titles reveal the stereotypical roles offered to Hispanics-many of the early \"Mexican\" film titles included the term \"greaser,\" beginning with the 1896 Nickelodeon short (Berumen, 1995) and continuing through 1918, when \"Guns and Greasers\" was released (Keller). Although filmmakers discontinued the use of this perjorative term, U. S. cinema maintained the static and stereotypical portrayals begun before the turn of the century - the dark lady, the bandito and the buffoon (Keller).\\nAs early as the 1920s, the Latino community decried these narrowly drawn, negative images and actors sometimes refused roles that insulted their \"ethnic identity and intelligence.\" But despite ongoing criticism, the Hollywood film industry\\'s responses to cries for more expansive roles for Latinos and more reality-based depictions of Latino communities have been shortlived and often shortsighted. Instead, U. S. cinema alternated between periods of no representation and mis-representation of Latinos.\\nMost often, mainstream filmmakers responded to cries of mis-representation by creating Latino heroes in the \"American\" image-borrowing the myth of the caballero from fiction. Most enduring of the mythical caballeros is Zorro, who entered the U. S. lexicon as a cultural icon, and who \"like his Anglo counterparts, of similar western series, his modus operandi was to ride in, destroy evil, and ride out, leaving a broken heart or two behind\" (Keller, 1985). Often presented in films as a pure-bred Spaniard and/or as a member of the upper class, Zorro campaigned bravely and tirelessly (in true action-hero form) to save Mexican peasants from corrupt officials. Beginning with the 1920 film \"The Mask of Zorro.\" The Zorro films have remained popular throughout the century. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) lists no less than 62 Zorro films, including the 1998 version of The Mask of Zorro which was a smashing commercial success, opening on 2,415 screens in the United States. The film earned $22 million in its first weekend and by December, 1998, had gross receipts worldwide of more than $194 million.\\nThe caballero, though a mixed representation, was one of the few remotely positive stereotypes. On the surface, Zorro provided an alternative representation of Latinos, one of the few Latino heroes in U. S. cinema, but in the end, his similarity to the \"American\" hero situates him as an exception to the norm, ensuring that the stereotype of the Latino as inept and corrupt remained undisturbed.\\nThroughout the century, despite a few rich roles in Westerns and some attempts to present banditos as part good/part bad, most films provided no roles for Latinos. In Westerns and crime films, however, the villain stereotypes were expanded to include sub-types. In the 1970s, as censorship lost its grip on movie content, the bandito role was expanded, but not to a multi-faced rich personality. Instead, the new bandito \"practices mayhem, sadism, and sex aplenty...enjoys killing men and raping women...\" (Keller, 1985).\\nThe 1980s offered promise that the roles of Latino/as and border areas would be expanded, especially with the burgeoning Chicano film movement in the United States and Mexico. Although a few films offered expanded representations of the Latino experience in the United States, (Zoot Suit,\" 1982; \"The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez,\" 1983; \"Stand and Deliver,\" 1987, and \"American Me,\" 1992) but few pointed the spotlight on border areas. Of the few films that addressed topics about the Mexican experience in American, the most expansive roles were in independent films such as \"Like Water for Chocolate\" (1993). Despite the promise of expanding representations in the 1980s, negative stereotypes dominated film images in the 1990s. Past stereotypes were perpetuated, with a twist to \"accomodate and reflect the changing political landscape... the stereotypes were narcotraficantes/drug dealers, criminals, bandits, gang members and undocumented workers. Latinas found themselves inevitably as prostitutes and cantineras...\" (Berumen, 1995).\\nAlthough the border and its towns have rarely been the topic of films, it has often been represented in U. S. cinema, particularly in Westerns and crime dramas, which generally did not present the area in a positive light. Most often, the Border was represented as a dividing line between civilization and lawlessness, a place of escape for unrepentant gunfighters. In later films, such as Orson Welles\\', \"A Touch of Evil\" (1958), the border town represents the most sinister of environments, a \"hellish\" town, \"a nightmare world behind everyday reality\" (Nericcio, 1992). If this were just one of many major representations of the border and its towns, there would be little danger of stereotyping, but it is one of few in mainstream Western film, and it exemplifies how border areas are used as settings for the interplay of good and evil.\\nKeller (1985) notes that the Mexican cinema hasn\\'t fared much better in representing the border areas.\\n\"\\x85while Mexican cinema was entirely capable of releasing from its exploitative, commercial crucible major works of artistic merit depicting popular, folkloric, historical, revolutionary, urban, social class, or other values, it was not capable of such achievement with respect to the depiction of the Chicano lifestyle or even the Mexican culture of the border in any of their significant dimensions or varieties. p. 15\"\\nThe Effects of Limited Representations of Latino/as and border areas\\nFilmmakers have approximately 90 minutes to introduce viewers to characters, establish each person\\'s identity and the story\\'s setting, and then work through the story plot and denouement. Given the time restrictions, portraying a character and setting in stereotypical manner allows viewers to quickly understand a character\\'s motivations and to anticipate his/her interaction with other characters in this environment. For most viewers, Cortes (1992) suggests that movies help organize information about \"race, ethnicity, culture and foreignness\" and help \"organize information and ideas about racial ethnic and cultural groups.\"\\nFor the dominant group, stereotyping doesn\\'t often result in serious consequences, because a range of \"types\" are represented. But Dyer (1993 suggests that limiting representations in the media to stereotypical, flat depictions allows members of minority groups to be cast into a role as \"other,\" sometimes with dire consequences. He argues these consequences result because \"how we are seen determines in part how we are treated; how we treat others is based on how we see them; such seeing comes from representation.\"\\nSo, although stereotypes spare viewers some cognitive energy, they often reinforce existing representations. For minority groups, this often means negative representations. Different minority groups have traditionally been assigned different roles to play, but analyses of movie roles and story lines over the past century show that minority ethnic groups have been relegated in all but a few films to portraying the \"deviant, less capable other.\" Until the past few years, for example, African-Americans were limited to five highly racialized roles established in 1915 with the release of D. W. Griffith\\'s controversial film, \"The Birth of a Nation.\"\\nHall (1982) argues that the few characteristics and images presented are actually used to \"reduce everything about the person to those traits, exaggerate and simplify them and fix them without change or development to eternity.\" In the case of Latino/as, Keller (1985) argues that the formula movies favored by the early movie industry, with its emphasis on Americanism and the resultant heroes and villains, firmly established a negative role for Latinos as \"real\" gangsters and outlaws. \"The usual components of wish fulfillment such as romance and true love, destroying evil... rewarding good, happy endings and so on, ensured that Hispanic and other outgroup characters would perform for the assembly line the role of vamps, seductresses, greasers, gangsters and the like, ad nauseum.\"\\nMany fear that limiting the representation of minority groups to a few negative stereotypes contributes to \"subliminal and conscious prejudice against Latinos and other ethnic, racial groups by Anglo Americans, Europeans, and also elitist Latin American and European Spaniards (Rios-Bustamante). This prejudice could occur because stereotypes help symbolically fix boundaries by setting up a symbolic frontier:\\n\"\\x85 [between] what belongs and what does not or is \\'Other\\', between \\'insiders\\' and \\'outsiders\\', \\'Us\\' and \\'Them\\'. It facilitates the \\'binding\\' or \\'bonding\\' together of all of \\'Us\\' who are \\'normal\\' into an \\'imagined community\\'; and it sends into symbolic exile all of Them-The Others-who are in some way different-beyond the pale\" Hall,(1982), p. 258.\\nMore importantly, Cores (1992) argues that presenting these stereotypical images reinforces existing audience perceptions and may actually \"hinder revisionist filmmakers, including Latinos, in their quest to gain critical acceptance of alternative presentations.\" This occurs because films manipulate images of the \"Latin Menace\\x85 iconographically generated by groups of gun-toting Mexican horsemen in the Old West or swaggering young Latinos-presumably gangs-in contemporary urban films.\" These images reinforce perceptions and images of Latinos, and \"condition audiences for future movies.\"\\nMovies That Make a Difference: \"El Mariachi\" and \"Lone Star\"\\nWilliams (1985) argues that despite this tendency for films to reinforce firmly held beliefs, films with rich representations can make help viewers adjust their images to more closely align with \"reality.\"\\n\"El Mariachi,\" directed by Robert Rodriquez, and \"Lone Star,\" directed by John Sayles, both benefited from the increasing audience interest in independent films that began in the 1980s. Independent films had expanded beyond their art house audiences and were attracting baby boomers, who had tired of formula movies and were looking for more complex story lines. With this broadening of audience demographics came an increased interest from distribution companies, and a search for movies that offered interesting narratives.\\n\"Lone Star\" and \"El Mariachi\" could not be more different in style and narrative: Rodriguez was a first time director and producer who favored action scenes with quick cuts; Sayles favored a more leisurely approach that gently switched between scenes of the past and the present, and allowed the story to unfold through a wide range of characters. Rodiguez hoped to generate enough sales in the Spanish-speaking video market to fund a \"real\" film; Sayles was following his tradition of making movies that represented areas of conflict in all their complexities.\\nYet despite these seeming differences, each movie challenged viewers to question their visions of the border and its inhabitants. Neither eschewed the realities of the area-like much of Northern Mexico and South Texas, the images presented a rocky, dry and often \"barren\" landscape. But despite these visual images, each presented a protagonist and story line that challenged the status quo and their beliefs about the nature of the place and its people.\\nUpon its release, Sayles\\' \"Lone Star\" was immediately hailed as groundbreaking movie, with a full range of likable characters that challenged stereotypes. As Sayles\\' narrator, Sam, searches for the \"truth\" about a decades-old murder and his father\\'s role in it, he provides the audience more than just the \"mainstream\" point of view - he directs viewers to the complexity of the situation and let viewers see the border situation through other eyes-the recent Mexican immigrant, the assimilated Mexican immigrant who lost her husband to a prejudiced rogue sheriff, the Native American who doesn\\'t recognize political boundaries, and the teacher who wants students to see past the narrowly drawn vision of the region\\'s history, to name a few. The cast of characters is large, but Sayles handles them deftly, and slowly guides the viewer to see each ethnic group in the context of shared history and the influence of other groups.\\nRodriguez\\' movie, on the other hand, has not been seriously studied because it contains negative images about the border and border images. As Noriega (1992) points out, \"Chicano film scholarship has tended to ground itself in the strategy of unmasking negative stereotypes while affirming positive images.\" But List (1992) suggests that it is important to examine how ingroup stereotypes might combat negative images imposed from the outside.\" She argues that Cheech Marin in \"Born in East L.A.\" (1987) subtly critiques ethnocentrism with his method of \"slipping the message into your coffee\\x85 so it goes down smooth, but later you feel the effect.\"\\nAlthough Rodriquez makes no such claims about the intentions of his film-it was actually intended as a quick money-making venture-the sympathetic portrayal of the protagonist belies the usual stereotype-not the insatiable \"Latin lover or drug dealer,\" but a \"regular guy\" looking for the \"good life.\" Rodriguez\\'protagonist wants to return to his \"roots,\" to search out the simple life enjoyed by his father, the mariachi. He is not the exception, he is the norm-again, a regular guy looking for the life being lost in the pursuit of the American dream \"across the other side.\" He doesn\\'t drive a car as a \"typical\" urban thug might, nor does he wear the stereotypical uniform. Instead, he wears what most clean-cut young men in the southwestern United States would wear-blue jeans, a button-down shirt and boots. When he crosses the border into Mexico, although the images are familiar, they hint of a different story\\x85 a story of mistaken identify, where the mariachi is pursued by an \"evil\" drug lord, but with a twist. By Rodriguez\\' design, the greedy, cut-throat is not a Mexican national, but a \"gringo\" from the other side. And the gringo drives the drug trade, murdering anyone who threatens to disturb his power.

As they move from junior high school to high school, their friendship selection patterns become much more stringent, often excluding others who do not share their class and ethnic background. This paper examines the exception to this data, as I present dialogic interactions between two adolescent females¡ªone African American; the other Anglo-Latina¡ªwho have been friends for over eleven years. Using the Bakhtinian concepts of dialogism, social language, speech genre, voice, addressivity, and answerability, I analyze strategies the girls use to maintain their long-term friendship despite latent cultural insults. Under some of the tenets of Critical Discourse Analysis, I trace how this negotiation is done through the constant shifting of power relations between the girls by invoking Foucault¡¯s notion of power as an analytical tool.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mass communication research almost certainly has varied practical effects on human health. For example, applications of knowledge may boost the effectiveness of advertising for products that hinder and also for those that enhance human well-being. In addition, research may help legitimize university skills courses, which also might magnify the impact of messages. This paper argues that dialectically joining the empirical and critical traditions in media study can help clarify such issues. In this light, it presents a theoretical framework for the study of the health impact of media research. It relies in part upon philosopher John Dewey\\x92s idea of a means-ends continuum, in which all ends represent means to other ends. Thus, research is seen not merely as an end but as an activity with sometimes-unrecognized consequences for human health, as well. Ultimately, the forms that media education takes represent a key to addressing health-related concerns.',\n",

Through an analysis of news production at four analytical levels, namely the global the national the organisational and the professional, I exemplify how processes of globalisation may lead to both homogenisation and diversification/'domestication'of news content. The study is based on newsroom observation and interviews with 40 media experts and news producers at the major Japanese broadcast stations. The interviews include managers, editors, foreign correspondents, news desk personnel, scriptwriters, producers and anchorpersons concerning their considerations from the planning until the finished product. Comparative content analysis exemplifies the outcome of news communication strategies as they differ in Japan and Denmark.\",\n",

This study finds support for earlier work on the importance of listener support and effective policy as influencing the success of local radios. More specifically, lack of coherent government support was found to impede greater public use of the Breton language. The concept of a flow was adapted from global media studies to the local level to explain the type of immersion in Breton language information necessary to recreate public socio-cultural sphere vital to the continuation of the Breton identity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study, based on depth interviews with journalists, is an analysis of the social context of journalistic deception. Borrowing from Elliot and Culver\\x92s (1992) comprehensive definition of journalistic deception that covers not only newsgathering practices but also the potential for deception in journalists\\x92 relationships with news audiences, as well as the omission-commission distinction, this research is an empirical attempt to locate the occupational and individual-grounded bases for deception. Why do journalists use deceptive methods such as impersonations, non-identifications, and fabrication in their work? Deception is located in a moral-pragmatic framework based on harm-benefit, the altruism of the act, and instrumental utilities such as convenience, personal safety and the bottom line. Woven into the journalists\\x92 accounts are attempts to normalize deceptive behavior\\x97consistent with the notion of deception as a prima facie wrong\\x97and the salience of organizational pressures such as legal and business concerns. As an occupational construct, journalistic deception is shaped by professional demands. Tacit rules govern what is acceptable and unacceptable deception based on assessments of the target of deception (newsmakers vs. news audiences), the perceived character of the person deceived, and the nature of the act (omission vs. commission).',\n",

We predicted that production pacing as a structural feature would require more mental resources as it increases, but that story commercials would not require many resources. We did not find main effect of pacing on encoding. But we found that medium paced commercials were recalled better than fast- and slow-paced commercials. Further, as we predicted, fast paced commercials were rated as more likable and led to higher purchase intention. There was a main effect of narrative structure on storage and retrieval. For both cued recall and free recall, story commercials were significantly recalled better than non-story commercials (image commercials and informative commercials). Also story commercials were rated as more likable and led to higher purchase intention. Unlike our prediction, processing story commercials was not cost free.

The paper analyzes the discursive elements that help to sustain the organization\\x92s root military metaphor, and identifies alternate metaphors for wildland firefighting safety that might help the Forest Service to redeem its discursive competence. Implications for rhetorical tools like root metaphor analysis, lists and stories, and the enthymeme, are discussed.',\n",

It also examines how these professionals\\x92 practices coincide with the global theory of public relations, \\x93generic principles and specific applications\\x94 in public relations. While most theoretical principles are based on organizations\\x92 perspectives, I attempt to focus more on the voices of public relations professionals working at firms, or agencies, and investigate issues surrounding the reality of public relations professionals in international settings. Through in-depth interviews with senior public relations professionals, I also examine the professionals\\x92 perspectives on how to communicate with their international clients, how to manage differences, and what they recommend as the most effective practices of international public relations based on their experiences.\\nThe findings show that public relations professionals try to balance general principles and specific applications in their practice. However, their unique identity as consultants makes it difficult to follow all the principles; the relationship with clients as individuals plays an important role. The best approach to the practice of public relations in an international setting is the mixture of both the global and the local approach, or local implementation under a global consistency, with providing local practitioners latitude under clear guidelines and goals of clients.',\n",

The historical dimension is analysed with special reference to the developments in Europe. Especially the discussion in Germany after the introduction of the silent movies is used to make evident that so called modern arguments (learning theory, escapism, habituation, suggestion etc.) have been developed in the times before World War I. E.g.; learning theory is not an invention of the twentieth century, but can be found (relating to media violence) in publications of the 17th century. The author argues, that it is important to look at media history in order not to waste time by inventing the wheel again and again (concerning the effects of depictions of violence). One border has to be overcome: we have to look back and learn from history. Because (to quote Alvin Gouldner) a science ignorant of its founders does not know how far it has travelled nor in what direction.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This study examined the ways different Ukrainian media -- three television channels, one newspaper, and one Internet site -- framed the Ukrainian political crisis of 2001. Dominant media frames and framing devices (Gamson & Lasch, 1983) were identified by content analysis of 829 news stories. Frames were compared across these news outlets as well as across different time periods to analyze the role of framing in public deliberation (Simon & Xenos, 2000). The study found that there was a strong influence of ideology on the way different Ukrainian media framed the news, and that this influence distorted the deliberation pattern. The study found that there were two main patterns of frames used by Ukrainian media: the overt propagandistic pattern and a pattern of hidden attempts at manipulation. The former consisted of the combination of two or more negative frames toward political opponents; the combination of one or more neutral frames and one negative frame toward the opponents comprised the latter. Metaphors and depictions were the dominant devices of framing the crisis among the Ukrainian media. Constructing the discourse, media tried to heavily exploit cultural values shared by Ukrainians: feelings associated with fascism, Civil War, Cold War, Stalin's repressions, etc.\",\n",

The posttest-only analysis, employing a Solomon-Four-Group design, showed that nonsmokers who participated in the curriculum had higher intentions to take action against tobacco use, reflective thinking about the persuasive effects of advertising, perceived realism of ads, perceived similarity of tobacco portrayals, and perceived desirability of tobacco portrayals. This suggests that their awareness of the content in tobacco advertising had been increased, along with their motivations to resist it. Smokers who participated in the media literacy intervention demonstrated greater knowledge, efficacy, intentions to take action, reflective thinking, and perceived realism of tobacco ads. They demonstrated lower levels of identification with media portrayals of smokers, expectancies for tobacco use, and susceptibility to peer influence to use tobacco. This suggests that smokers changed a number of attitudes and beliefs predictive of tobacco use, in addition to a greater motivation to resist tobacco advertising.\\nThe results suggest that media literacy has important and somewhat different effects on tobacco users and nonusers, indicating its potential for broad application in health communication campaigns.',\n",

The Enron collapse provides a case in point summary of why legal standards should never be used as a substitute for ethical principles. Using legal standards to analyze an issue only indicates what is a legal course of action, not what is a morally desirable course of action. As we illustrate in this discussion of Enron, seeking loopholes in the law can lead to ethical violations that are more severe that legal ones. We argue that issues management is the proper location of ethical decision making in an organization. We also determine that the spirit of the law is derived from moral philosophy, and moral philosophy should be used as the ethical arbiter of organizational decision making.\\nAn organization can manage ethical dilemmas through either a deontological approach or in a materialistic manner. We demonstrate the pitfalls of a materialist approach to ethics through use of the Enron case. This paper recommends a deontological approach based on Kantian ethics of moral autonomy and good intention as a basis for ethical issues management. We conclude by offering practical guidelines, based on deontology, to assist in ethical decision making.',\n",

This combination of information provides the basis for understanding the movie as it unfolds and for predicting future events in the movie. Unfortunately, little research has focused on how people create a coherent understanding of what they are watching (but see Livingstone, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1996). This focus on the understanding \\x96 or coherence \\x96 of a movie, and on the cognitive representation that under girds it is central to the mental models approach.\\nExtensive research has been conducted focusing on mental models of text comprehension (Bower & Rinck, 1999; Garnham, 1996; Garnham & Oakhill, 1996; Gernsbacher, 1995; Graesser & Zwaan, 1995; Graesser & Wiemer-Hastings, 1999; Magliano, Zwaan, & Graesser, 1999; Oakhill, 1996; Rickheit & Habel, 1999; van Dijk, 1999; Zwaan, 1999). This research has demonstrated that mental models play an integral role in the comprehension and representation of written texts. In addition, mental models guide the nature of the inferences that people make while reading a text. In our opinion, understanding books, personal discourse, the media, or the world in general, requires constructing a coherent mental model to represent the event. To the extent that a person can construct such a model, the person is said to understand the event (Halford, 1993; Wyer & Radvansky, 1999). Unfortunately, we are aware of no research has that explored the role of mental models in the comprehension of media stories.\\nThe mental models\\x92 approach reflects the observation that thinking typically occurs within and about situations (Garnham, 1997). Mental models are the cognitive representations of (a) situations in real, hypothetical, or imaginary worlds, including space and time, (b) entities found in the situation and the states those entities are in, (c) interrelationships between the various entities and the situation, including causality and intentionality, and (d) events that occur in that situation (Garnham, 1997; Johnson-Laird, 1983; Radvansky & Zacks, 1997; Wyer & Radvansky, 1999; Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998).\\nWe have used the mental models approach to investigate how a movie is understood. When watching a movie, generating a coherent understanding of that movie can be difficult because of limitations in both attentional resources and short-term memory. Indeed, sometimes movies are designed to take advantage of these limitations to create ambiguity. Consider the movie Falling Down. In the movie, Michael Douglas plays a defense engineer (Defens) who has been fired from his job. The movie begins with him stuck in a traffic jam near downtown L.A. He abandons his car and proceeds to start walking home. Everyone he encounters, mostly stereotypic characters such as a threatening ghetto gang, a rude convenience store owner, and a white supremacist, all upset him. He reacts with increasing violence. As he walks across L.A., he calls his ex-wife, telling her that he is coming home to see his daughter for her birthday. She is clearly frightened by the phone call, indicating that there is more to the situation. By the end of the movie, viewers are convinced that Defens is insane.\\nThere are three interpretations of the movie, based on the movie cover and comments about the movie on the web. One interpretation portrays Defens as an average man who is fighting back against an insane society (hero interpretation). A second interpretation is that the movie is a comedy about a man dealing with exaggerated everyday pressures (comedy interpretation). The third interpretation is that the movie is about a man on the edge of insanity who finally goes over the edge because of the pressures from society (insane interpretation).\\nGiven the distinct interpretations of this movie, we decided to test whether the different interpretations resulted in different mental models of the movie. We used a multidimensional scaling (MDS) of viewers\\x92 perceptions of the characters in the movie to identify the different mental models of the movie. We hypothesize that the different interpretations should manifest themselves in different configurations within a multidimensional space. In our investigation of people\\x92s mental models of this movie, we had 89 participants watch the movie. At the end of the movie, we had them rate the similarities of the 9 main characters in the movie. That is, for every pair of characters, participants rated their similarity on a11-point scale (for a total of 36 similarity ratings). We converted the similarity ratings to dissimilarity ratings and then submitted the dissimilarity ratings to a multidimensional scaling analysis. The solution is a depiction in a multidimensional space of participants\\x92 perceptions of the characters. We viewed this solution as a snapshot of the participants\\x92 mental model of the movie. After the similarity ratings, participants rated on an 11-point scale their acceptance of each of the interpretations. Almost everyone thought that Defens was insane. However, about half the participants thought that he also was a hero, whereas the other half did not. We looked at the multidimensional scaling solution separately for those who thought of Defense as a hero and those who did not.\\nThe MDS analysis indicated that a 3-dimensional representation was the best fit for both the here and the insane interpretations of the movie (insane interpretation: stress = .066, % variance = .96; here interpretation: stress = .070, % variance = .95; Kruskal & Wish, 1978). In order to interpret the multidimensional space, we had the same 89 participants rate each of the characters along a number of different dimensions. The locations of the people within the MDS were used as predictor variables and the ratings along the different variables were the criterion variable in a series of regression analysis that were used to test the fit of various dimensional interpretations (see Kruskal & Wish, 1978; Roskos-Ewoldsen, 1997). For both interpretations of the movie, the first dimension was an evaluative good/bad dimension (insane interpretation, R2 = .97; hero interpretation, good/bad R2 = .98). Defens was perceived as moderately bad in each interpretation of the movie. Likewise, the second dimension dealt with the obsessiveness of the characters (insane interpretation, R2 = .95; hero interpretation, R2 = .94). Again, Defens was interpreted as moderately obsessive in each interpretation of the movie. However, the third dimension for the insane interpretation dealt the aggressiveness of the characters (R2 = .89). Defens was judged as moderately aggressive. On the other hand, the third dimension for the hero interpretation dealt how sympathetic the characters were in the movie (R2 = .93). Defens was judged as sympathetic in this interpretation of the movie.\\nWe interpret these findings as suggestion that people did construct different mental models for the different interpretations of the movie. Furthermore, we believe that this findings suggest that MDS provides a useful methodology for capturing snapshots of people\\x92s mental models of a movie or television show.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\nBower, G.

       "  'abstract': \"Abstract\\nThis study utilized a reinterpretation of the priming hypothesis to understand the effect of fantasy violence on children's moral reasoning. A post-test only control group experimental design was utilized. A total of 121 children were randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions. Children saw one of two nearly identical versions of a fantasy violence program with the ending manipulated. In the clip, the main character either used physical violence to solve a conflict or the violence was edited out and the main character appeared to walk away from the conflict. A third group of children was in the no treatment control condition. Subsequently, children were administered the Moral Interpretations of Interpersonal Violence (MIIV) scale that assesses children's judgments of violent dilemmas and assesses their reasoning about those judgments from a developmental perspective. It was found that children who saw the violent ending judged subsequent violent stories as more correct and utilized less advanced moral reasoning strategies when explaining their answers. Neither age nor empathy mediated the main effect. Therefore, it is concluded that the activation of mental models regarding violence is an automatic process that occurs somewhat independently of other potential mediators.\",\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The selection and use of reference terms in discourse can do much to indicate whom a speaker is addressing and with whom he or she is aligning. This can be particularly problematic in public address, in that the selection of one descriptor or proterm over another can effectively include one category or population of persons in the audience and exclude others. Indeed, some seemingly generic or ambiguous references, when situated within public discourse, can be used to infer that differences or asymmetries are being implied between categories or populations of persons. In a speech exchange system whose design demonstrates a concern with inclusiveness, drawing boundaries between participants and their positions on issues under deliberation can be a sensitive matter, particularly if the issues are controversial, or potentially divisive.\\n\\nIn this paper, we explore the sensitivity of managing alignment with others while maintaining one\\'s differences with, or distance from, them, as evidenced in speakers\\' use of an ambiguously inclusive categorical reference term, \"we.\" Our analytic site is in the speech of participants in a public meeting. The paper begins by reviewing what we know about \"doing sensitivity\" and gives background on the public meeting that is the paper\\'s focus. Then we analyze the uses of \"we\" in the presentations of two participants at this meeting. We show that the indexicality and ambiguity of \"we\" and related terms are used by speakers to distance themselves from certain categories of persons and activities, while at the same time including members of the audience, and aligning themselves with categories of persons among them. These uses of \"we,\" we argue, provide participants with a means of indexing yet obscuring the moral judgment of persons and/or moral implications of their actions. That is, we demonstrate how uses of \"we\" call attention to the matters under discussion, and the very discussion of them, as \"sensitive,\" or potentially disruptive to the proceedings and divisive or offensive to parties involved in them.',\n",

Tolkien\\x92s Lord of the Rings trilogy, the fantasy realm of Middle-earth has been transformed from a literary abstraction into a filmic visualization. During the novels\\x92 four-year transition from page to screen, online fan clubs and CMC have been sustaining life-lines for fans to connect to each other, to the literary texts, to the world of Middle-earth, and most volubly, to writer/director Peter Jackson\\x92s artistic decisions. Thus, an ancient borderland inhabited by hobbits, dwarves, elves, goblins, and wizards is reinvented and revitalized as a futuristic borderland inhabited by USENETers, chatters, gamers, and avatars. Throughout the entire process of writing the screenplay, casting the characters, filming the production, and marketing the trilogy, Jackson and New Line Cinema have engaged in collaborative and promotional interactions with Tolkien online fans. This paper examines the impact of CMC at those four stages of cinematic adaptation.

Based on ethnographic fieldwork among Burmese opposition activists in Thailand, this paper demonstrates how gender operates as the dominant frame through which communications technologies are understood and used. In the Burmese context, conventional understandings of gender have worked together with the global discourses of democracy and human rights to reinforce gender and ethnic inequities, ultimately facilitating the process of militarization. Perhaps the greatest hope for change, however, lies in the fact that women themselves are working to change the practices that have for so long inhibited the process of genuine democratization.

       "  'abstract': 'Analyzing the rhetoric of trade publications that target journalism professionals in the United States, this paper examines the ways in which journalists and editors interpreted their experiences in producing news narratives on September 11 for their audiences. Conducting a feminist and semiotic analysis of stories that appeared in the American Journalism Review, Columbia Journalism Review, Communicator, Broadcast and Cable, and Quill, the paper argues that journalists\\x92 public memories of their work relied on masculine metaphors of military and sport, reproduced Orientalist images of Muslim men, and privileged empiricist tasks of knowledge production over complex processes of internal reflection and historical contextualization. Exploring the reasons for such a masculinist construction of the profession, the analysis will situate the profession of journalism within other discourses of masculine capability and public ignorance of the Muslim world. Finally, fleshing out the implications of the analysis for pedagogy, the paper will offer recommendations for the training of future journalists in the classroom.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"An old and basically unsolved problem is whether political media coverage causes political mobilization or political alienation. Both of these contradictory assumptions seem to have been verified to the same extend by empirical studies. Yet, both theories are mostly examined by one time surveys which do not justify the claim that recipients' evaluations were really caused by media coverage. As a consequence, it remains unsure which of these assumptions is correct.\\nThis study is concerned with the influence of political media coverage on individual changes in recipients' judgments on politics. We employed a combination of the methods of content analysis of television news and a panel survey conducted in six waves within a period of over three years. Content analysis data and survey data were then linked for each individual recipient. Recipients who had obtained predominantly positive information about politicians and political parties via television news four weeks prior to an interview did not develop a more positive political attitude. However, those recipients who had received predominantly negative information developed a less favorable view on politics. Causes and effects of these results will be discussed.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The 1990s ushered in a proliferation of televised representations of gays and lesbians. Along with an increased representation in weekly series, the often-ghettoized genre of the made-for-TV-movie followed suit in depicting sexual minorities. In these films, a noticeable trend is their adherence to what some have critiqued in the television movie as the personalization of the political. Most specifically, network and non-pay cable channels have tended to focus their lesbian narratives on universal issues of family (often the victimized mother). I will show how both Two Mothers for Zachary and What Makes a Family?, by addressing the universal concepts of mother and justice, exceed the expectations of docudrama by troubling homophobic politics while addressing an audience through an overt personalization of and manipulation by the films narratives. However, while these films render explicit the pervasive homophobia and hypocritical notions of family which guide our justice system, they simultaneously construct a limited and legitimized notion of The Lesbian via narrative (re)construction and star involvement. By examining the narratives, true stories, and popular reviews of these two films, I explore the possible ramifications of the clustered presentations of the victimized lesbian mother. Furthermore, with an eye toward the work of Judith Butler, Christine Holmlund, and Sue Ellen Case, I attempt to uncover The Lesbian who through repeated representation and call for identification becomes legitimized while alternatives are made invisible and/or inferior.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Monitoring and Blunting Coping Styles as Moderators of Fear Appeal Effects',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Monitoring and Blunting Coping Styles as Moderators of Fear Appeal Effects\\nOver 50 years of fear appeal research still leaves us uncertain as to the conditions under which fear may effectively lead to adaptive attitude and behavior change. Theoretical emphasis has been placed on the relative weighting of threat and efficacy perceptions to understand adaptive versus maladaptive action (e.g., Rogers, 1975, Witte, 1992). While these perceptions are clearly important for the evocation of fear and potential responses, no fear appeal model based solely on these concepts is particularly well-supported by empirical research (Boster & Mongeau, 1984; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Mongeau, 1998; Witte, 1994). Surprisingly, though emotions are generally considered a mechanism to cope for the environment (e.g., Lazarus, 1991), fear most especially, extant research has not considered how coping style might impact the effects of fear arousal on information processing and message acceptance.\\nMonitoring and blunting coping styles are believed to reflect the degree to which people seek out or avoid information when confronting threatening situations (Miller, 1987). A number of studies investigating the effect of monitoring and blunting in clinical settings conclude that monitors tend to experience more anxiety during medical procedures, tend to respond better to more information, and pay more attention to preventative health behaviors (Miller, 1991). However, unanswered questions include how the effects of a message designed to evoke anxiety or fear might be processed differently by monitors versus blunters and to what effect. Stated differently, perhaps adaptive versus maladaptive reactions to fear appeals is a function not just of perceived severity weighed against perceived efficacy, but of coping style triggered in the face of threatening information. In considering coping style in the context of fear appeal exposure, we posit two hypotheses, noting first that monitoring and blunting are not considered opposite ends of the same scale, but rather two distinct coping styles.\\nFirst as monitors desire information and blunters avoid it, we would expect a positive correlation between monitoring and message processing depth, but a negative association between blunting and processing depth (H1). Second, whereas monitors and blunters should have comparable reactions under conditions of low fear arousal, we would expect that under conditions of greater fear arousal, monitors would have a more positive response to the message but blunters would have a more negative one.\\nMethod\\nOf 320 city residents handed a survey ostensibly to examine reactions to information about diabetes, 290 were returned completed. Respondents¡¦ mean age was 44.78 years (SD = 14.65); 59% were female, 41Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide characterale. After completing demographic and perceived knowledge (\\x83Ñ = .92) and relevance (\\x83Ñ = .86) items for several health topics including diabetes, respondents read a message about diabetes designed as a mild fear appeal. The message contained information about prevalence and risk factors for diabetes, the symptoms and health complications associated with type 2 diabetes, and the steps people can take to protect their health (i.e., health diet, exercise, and get tested). Participants then completed a depth of message processing scale (\\x83Ñ = .94), a biased processing measure (\\x83Ñ = .82), attitude and behavioral intention measures for a dieting (\\x83Ñ = .78 and \\x83Ñ = .68) and getting a blood test (\\x83Ñ = .83 and testing \\x83Ñ = .79), fear arousal during message exposure (\\x83Ñ = .93), monitoring and blunting scales (\\x83Ñ = .77 and \\x83Ñ = .84 respectively), and family and personal history of diabetes.\\nAnalyses were based on ANCOVAs for which the predictor variables ¡V fear, monitoring, and blunting ¡V were dichotomized based on median splits. Relevant control variables were taken into consideration, including sex, age, education level, race, current health, topic relevance, perceived knowledge, family history, and prior diabetes screening.\\nResults\\nH1: Monitoring, Blunting, and Message Processing\\nPartial correlations indicated a positive relationship between monitoring coping style and message processing depth (r = .14, p < .05, n = 271), and a negative association between blunting and processing depth (r = -.16, p < .01, n = 271). These results confirm H1 and serve as an indication of the validity of the coping style and message processing measures. Of note, blunting was positively correlated with biased processing (r = .12, p = .05, n = 271), suggesting that as expected, blunters engaged in cognitive techniques to discount threatening information. There was no association between monitoring and biased processing (r = -.01, ns).\\nH2: Coping Style, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions\\nTwo sets of dependent measures were included in the survey: attitudes and behavioral intentions toward dieting behavior and getting a blood test to possibly diagnose diabetes. All dependent measures were subjected to Monitoring (low vs. high) x Blunting (low vs. high) x Fear (low vs. high) ANCOVA analysis. For three of the four analyses (all but attitude toward getting a blood test), a main effect for fear was evidenced (all ps \\x84T .05). For both behavioral intention measures, the high fear group was more persuaded. However, for attitude toward dieting, the low fear group was more persuaded. A main effect for blunting was identified only for attitude toward blood testing (p = .05) for which low blunters had more positive attitudes than high blunters. No main effect for monitoring was revealed in the analyses.\\nFor three of the four analyses (all but attitude toward dieting), the expected Monitoring x Fear interaction was evidenced (ps \\x84T .05). In all cases, the high and low monitors differed little when experiencing low fear. However, when aroused, high monitors indicated stronger attitudes towards getting a blood test and intentions to get a blood test and diet relative to low monitors.\\nCounter to hypothesis, no Fear x Blunting interactions proved significant. However, a 3-way Fear x Monitoring x Blunting interaction appeared in two of the analyses: attitude toward blood testing and intentions to diet (ps < .05). For blood testing attitude, the interaction suggesting that the fear x monitoring interaction was particularly strong for the low blunters. Conversely, for intentions to diet, the fear x monitoring interaction was particularly strong for the high blunters.\\nIn sum, these findings suggest that coping style ¡V monitoring in particular -- is a potentially important factor to consider when investigating the persuasive effects of fear appeals. Though no conclusive claims can be drawn a consistent pattern of high monitors responding particularly well when more fearful suggests this to be a variable worth including in future research on fear appeals. Additional findings focused on processing style and models of the relationships reported here will be included in the completed version of this paper.\\nReferences\\nBoster, F. J., & Mongeau, P.

       "  'abstract': 'This project examines newspaper coverage as an expression of society\\x92s need for stories that underscore powerful norms regarding ethnicity and multiculturalism. What is the role of journalists in voicing norms and myths about issues related to race and ethnicity?\\nThe case subject is the refusal of a Swedish town, Sjöbo, to accept refugees in 1987 and 1988 in violation of national immigration policy. A storm of negative coverage accompanied the unfolding political situation; in its wake, the town came to symbolize xenophobia, racism, and general backwardness in Swedish society.\\n\\nThe paper begins with Stephen Reese\\x92s idea of a News Paradigm, seeking to understand the media\\x92s role in supporting the dominant ideology and the News Paradigm\\x92s function therein. Data were gathered using content and discourse analysis of 300 newspaper articles as well as transcriptions of depth interviews with the journalists who regularly covered the story.\\n\\nThe analysis indicates that the news paradigm is strong but not invisible, because journalists operate self-consciously within it. The newspaper article texts are strikingly similar both in terms of the normative consensus they support and in terms of the professional ideology reflected in them. However, interviews with the journalists suggest that they felt trapped by the news paradigm, implying that its primary strength, its invisibility, is undermined by individual journalist sensibilities.\\n\\nIn addition, analysis of newspaper articles reveals that the media\\x92s role in describing and perhaps perpetuating events became a prominent subtext in the newspaper narrative.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"People get a lot of their political information from visual media, yet we know very little about the impact on political knowledge that images have. In a set of experiments embedded in a general population survey, I examine the effect of adding visual elements to traditional verbal knowledge questions. Then, I compare respondents' performance on two scales of political knowledge, a scale that measures visual recognition of politicians, and a traditional verbal knowledge scale. Data for this paper comes from a web-based survey of 2,358 randomly selected U.S. residents. Using a web-based survey design allows me to add photos of politicians to knowledge questions. I find, first, that minimal visual cues can increase people's performance on verbal political knowledge tests. Second, the analysis reveals clear differences between the sources of verbal and visual political knowledge. People who prefer visual news media-television news, rather than radio news or newspapers-have greater visual political knowledge. Verbal knowledge, in contrast, increases with political interest regardless of which medium people prefer. Basing our assessments of political knowledge only on verbal measures thus hides a major contribution of TV news to increasing political knowledge and disadvantages people in traditional knowledge tests who get a lot of their political information from television.\",\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The paper will report the results of a study that analyzes how (potential) voters form candidate evaluations in a dynamic campaign environment. We analyze the process by which initial candidate preference guides a subsequent search and selection of campaign information; how recipients of this information integrate it in an on-line affective tally; and/or how they store and retrieve the information from memory to form a final candidate preference and candidate evaluations. The study draws on several theories and addresses issues that have received considerable attention in recent years.\\nThe cognitive information processing framework (Lang, 2000) has paid increasing attention to motivated information processing. The central idea is that recipients of information are not just passive receivers of information but are actively engaged in processing information. Preexisting attitudes and preferences, as well as processing goals, affect the selection, perception and acceptance of messages (Baumeister & Newman, 1994; Biek, Wood, & Chaiken, 1996; Ditto & Lopez, 1992; Kunda, 1990; Lodge & Taber, 2000). The research cited above stresses the important role of affect in information processing, exemplified in concepts such as \\x93hot cognition\\x94 and on-line information processing (the sequential updating of evaluative tallies).\\nTwo types of process models are used to explain the formation of candidate evaluations (Lavine, 2002). The on-line process assumes that voters, once they have formed an initial impression of the candidates, incrementally update a running, affective tally for each candidate whenever they encounter information about the candidate (anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic). While the running affective tally is stored and is highly accessible in memory, the memory for the content of the information usually decays quickly. The memory-based process, on the other hand, assumes that voters only form a candidate evaluation when asked for it. Only then they start searching their memory for relevant information and integrate their thoughts into an overall evaluation. Our first research question (RQ1) is to determine which of the two processes postulated above is a better predictor of final candidate evaluations.\\nFurthermore, information processing is goal-oriented, and the type of processing goal has been found to influence the processing mode (Huang & Price, 2001; Redlawsk, 2001). More specifically, the goal of \\x93forming an impression\\x94 about candidates should induce an on-line formation of candidate evaluations and lead to a lower recall of information. The goal to \\x93learn and remember as much as possible\\x94 about candidates should attenuate an on-line formation of candidate evaluations and facilitate a memory-based process. Our first hypothesis (H1) predicts that the information processing goal (task manipulation: impression formation vs. learning condition) will influence how candidate evaluations are formed (processing mode: on-line vs. memory-based, respectively).\\nProcessing goal and processing mode can influence how voters search and recall information about candidates (Lau, 1995). More specifically, voters who merely form an impression of candidates can be expected to focus on one candidate at a time (candidate-centered information search) and update their affective tally without encoding most content of the information in memory. Those who want to learn and remember as much as possible about the candidates can be expected to both look for and recall more information across candidates (comparative information search). Thus, our second hypothesis (H2) predicts that processing goal and processing mode influence the type of the information search (candidate-centered vs. comparative). Our third hypothesis (H3) predicts that processing goal and processing mode influence the amount of recall (low vs. high recall).\\nMethodologically, the paper proposes and uses a computer-based study design that introduces enhanced realism in the study. Instead of exposing participants to a fixed set of specific messages in a static environment and merely measuring their reactions, our study used a dynamic information board that created a fictional campaign environment that is over-saturated with quickly changing information. Out of necessity, participants were forced to be selective and could choose only a limited number of messages. The computer-based study used custom-developed software (in Visual Basic 6) to dynamically present the information in form of headlines (and associated articles) and to track the information selection and processing behavior of the study participants. After completing the search, participants were asked about their perceptions and ratings of the information.\\n\\nData & Methods\\nThe data collection for the experiment was completed in Summer 2002.\\nParticipants: The participants were 229 undergraduate students who were offered extra credit for study participation.\\nDesign, Procedure, and Stimuli: After participants completed an initial questionnaire about political issues, they were randomly assigned to either an accuracy condition (\\x93to learn and remember as much as possible about the candidates\\x94) or an impression formation condition (\\x93to form an impression of the candidates\\x94). The former condition was expected to induce a more systematic and objective information search, the latter condition was expected to facilitate development of an affective on-line tally as well as a more directional, biased information search that will strengthen the initial candidate preference.\\nThe subsequent procedures were identical for both conditions. All participants were asked to play the role of a voter during a fictitious election campaign for an open congressional seat in Illinois. They were told they should be prepared to vote for a candidate in the upcoming election. The experiment required that they choose headlines and articles from the last ten weeks of the campaign. During the task, participants were presented with a random sequence of 40 headlines that, when clicked on, opened newspaper-style stories associated with the candidates in a window. On the \\x93front-page\\x94 of the newspaper, participants always encountered four headlines that changed every 25 seconds to the next set of four headlines. On each screen, each candidate was mentioned in two of the headlines (one positive and one negative, respectively). The valence of the headlines was manipulated by using negative or positive words in the headline. A list of positive words (e.g., praise, hail, support) and negative words (e.g., accuse, oppose, criticize) was developed and used to create the headlines. The headline order across the ten screens and on each screen was randomized. The computer kept track of the selection and processing behavior (headlines, reading time) of the participants.\\nAfter their \\x93vote,\\x94 participants were asked to complete several additional scales and tasks that measured information processing and effect variables. These included detailed candidate ratings, demographics, political predispositions, and a free recall/thought listing task. Participants were also asked to rate their recall items in terms of valence and importance for their candidate evaluations. They were also shown the articles they had read during the information search and asked to rate each of them in terms of valence and whether they perceived candidate bias.\\n\\nImplications\\nBy focusing on how voters process campaign information, the proposed study makes an important contribution to the research on how voters pay attention to campaign information and form candidate evaluations. The dynamic study design presented the participants with a fast-moving, information-saturated campaign environment that forced them to be selective. Giving participants the ability to select messages introduced increased realism in the experimental design and should facilitate the observation of motivated information processing. Because citizens in the \\x93real\\x94 world have the ability to be selective, denying participants in previous experiments this opportunity limits the ability of these studies to understand how recipients process political campaign information.\\nThe study design allows us to track and analyze participants\\x92 information search behavior. This makes it possible to better determine with more appropriate measures which processing mode participants use to form candidate evaluations. The actual encounter of messages during the information search helps to measure on-line processing, and the recalled information helps to measure for memory-based processing. By focusing on the process between stimulus (campaign information) and response (candidate evaluations), we are able to shed some light on the information processing that happens in the \\x93black box\\x94 of the human mind. Our paper will discuss in detail the implications of our findings for the specific theories involved and for political information processing in general.\\n\\nReferences\\nBaumeister, R.

       "  'abstract': 'This study was designed to identify, from a uses-and-gratifications point of view, the motives that young people in the age of 12 to 25 have for using SMS. The study also aimed to assess whether these SMS motives are related to age, gender, current education, mobile phone experience, SMS experience and SMS use. We located four types of motives for using SMS: entertainment, social interaction, immediate access, and efficiency (in time). Immediate access and social interaction were most salient and more often endorsed by young people than entertainment and efficiency (in time). The results of this study show that the most salient reason for young people in the age of 12 to 25 to use SMS is the convenience of being able to contact and interact with their peers whenever they want and wherever they are. To distinguish heavy SMS users from moderate SMS users, the following significant predictors were established: entertainment, social interaction, immediate access, mobile phone use, and current education. A remarkable finding from our study is that apparently, adolescents (age 12 to 18) use SMS more often for intrinsic or social use, like entertainment and social interaction, than young adults (age 18 to 25), who use SMS more often for instrumental or task-oriented use, like efficiency (in time). Another interesting finding was that although male and female users do not differ with respect to the number of messages sent, female users are apparently more enthusiastic about using SMS as a means of communication than male users.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the early work done by Asch (1952), Sherif (1935), and Deutsch and Gerard (1955), the study of normative influences seems to be making a comeback in recent years. Although there is some evidence to support the idea that restructuring normative beliefs can result in behavior change, the norms literature is silent about how or why this influence occurs. The literature also confounds descriptive and injunctive norms. Through a 2 (descriptive norms: high or low) x 2 (perceived benefits: high or low) x 2 (similarity: high or low) between-subjects (N = 174) experiment, we tested whether two cognitive mechanisms moderated the norms-behavior link. Results indicated that descriptive norms do not exert a direct influence on behavior. Rather, perceived benefits moderated the relation between descriptive norms and behavioral intention and perceived similarity moderated the relation between descriptive norms and self-efficacy. Recommendations for norms-based campaigns include (a) making distinctions between descriptive and injunctive norms, (b) specifying the underlying moderating variables, and (c) distinguishing strategies to improve self-efficacy from those to change behaviors.',\n",

Over a two-month period, the author did in-depth interviews with more than 20 college students at a Midwestern university who had gotten tattoos. The author argues that although tattooing among college students was a form of cultural consumption, these tattooed students also tried to transform tattoos into signifers distinguishing themselves from others, and freeze a special moment in time or a relationship as an antidote to postmodern fluidity. The author also found that these young students got tattoos as a form of non-verbal intra-personal communication, which means the tattoo is more than a visual signifer open to other people's interpretations; it also serves as a signifer with special signifed meaning to the tattooed persons themselves.\",\n",

Three significant myths and their implications are discussed: (1) the myth of the universal Marcos; (2) of noble savages and passive victims; and (3) of the neoliberal beast. These myths inscribe the movement with meaning that goes well beyond events and circumstances in Mexico and they channel the energies of national and international supporters.

One of the issues to be dealt with is what to do with the former Taliban fighters who have been captured in Afghanistan. The most dangerous have been transported to the detainee camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba where they are being held under heavy guard indefinitely. A controversy has arisen over how to treat the detainees. The issue has not only created a partisan spit, it has polarized parts of the Bush administration and put the U.S. at odds with the rest of the world. This study uses a \\x93community structure approach\\x94 to explore the connection between city characteristics and nationwide newspaper coverage of extending Prisoner of War status to the Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees imprisoned at Guantanamo, Cuba.

The articles were then coded for both prominence and article direction (favorable, unfavorable, or neutral), then combined to calculate a single score \\x93Media Vector\\x94 for each newspaper.

       "  'abstract': 'Over the last two decades college radio has become commodified in various ways, resulting in two identifiable trends at specific college stations: standardization and professionalization. This essay suggests that these two trends have affected feminist cultural production by creating an andocentric climate, silencing young women at college radio stations. Relying primarily on interviews with women working at four different college stations in the US, and applying a feminist political economic theoretical framework, this essay highlights and interprets their experiences working in college radio. Throughout the course of this project, the young women interviewed demonstrated two distinct reactions to commodification occurring at these stations. These reactions are significant because they point to an important legacy of Riot Grrrl. Women who self identified as having a Riot Grrrl feminist sensibility responded in more nuanced, informed and critical ways than women who did not claim such an identity.',\n",

We examine how Dutch newspapers frame the Bosnian war. From our perspective framing starts with the selection process, resulting in specific way of covering the news. Our research shows that the newspapers produce significantly more news about human suffering than the chronology (extra media data about the daily events in the conflict made by the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation on Srebrenica NIOD, 2002). The assumption that news coverage increases when national interests are at stake finds its proof as well. The presence of Dutch soldiers in Bosnia guarantees a continuous attention to their activities. The research shows also remarkable differences between the various newspapers in media coverage.',\n",

During a 16-day coverage of the air disaster, journalists from the United States and South Korea reported the cause of the crash very differently. Korean journalists framed the cause on a combination of bad weather, faulty navigation devices, and negligence on the part of the Guam air traffic controllers but American journalists highlighted pilot error as the most probable cause. The comparative textual analysis of the news stories in the New York Times and NBC Nightly News of the United States, and JoongAng Ilbo and KBS News at 9 of South Korea, as well as depth interviews with the journalists who covered the crash, traces the divergent reporting to national interest, dissimilar interpretations of information from news sources, and preconceived personal biases held by these journalists.

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Historically, women\\x92s untraditional or gender-disrupting behaviors have been fodder for psychiatric diagnosis. The 19th century hysteria epoch, for example, has been critiqued as a moment of pathologization of mass middle females challenging the gender status quo rather than an actual epidemic of mental disorder. This paper argues that hysteria shares numerous symptoms with other periods in western history where women have been pathologized. It tracks these similarities by deconstructing the \"symptoms\" ascribed to the different disorders, including neurosis in the 1950\\x92s, personality disorders and post traumatic stress disorder in the 1980s and most recently, depression. Even while psychiatric literature describes depression as a disease that doesn\\x92t discriminate, this study argues that the psychiatric discourse works specifically to dub women\\x92s coping mechanisms and low productivity as dysfunctional and thereby \"re-feminizes\" depression. By drawing out the similarities among 20th century \"female\" disorders, the study contends that depression and depression-linked diagnoses have become normalized in the late 20th century. More, this cultural comfort with naming women\\x92s distress as disorder has allowed for new \"technologies\" of behavioral discipline to arise, namely activities of self-scrutiny, self-diagnosis, an appetite for psychopharmaceutical drugs and self-conducted treatments, and finally, new diagnosis created by mainstream media.',\n",

       "  'title': 'NGOs AND GOVERNMENT: THE SOCIAL SHAPING OF INTERNET FROM BELOW',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'This paper argues that novel approaches to social development of the Internet have emerged in Latin America. NGOs and social movements were a much greater influence on the early development of the Internet there, relative to commercial and other actors. This seems to have left important effects on the role of the Internet in society. The very early use of the Internet as a international tool for organizing resources and support by the Zapatistas in 1991 was only the most visible of a number of ways that NGOs, social movements and political groups throughout Latin America began to use the Internet to network among each other and mobilize support abroad. Small NGOs in Brazil were often using the Internet before medium size businesses. Peru developed extensive public Internet access before the United States did. While many businesses and branches of government are only now beginning to use the Internet, hundreds of NGOs have been using since 1990. We argue that this has given these groups within civil society a considerable agility in organizing and acting that may well create a lasting effect on relative power relations with other more traditional sectors of society.\\nThis different path of Internet development is due to several converging factors. First, many activists across Latin America turned in the 1980s away from state-centered political work to grassroots organizing, often using alternative media (Fox l988). Second, a quite different relationship had developed between university and society in Latin America, which led professors and students to take technology into activism almost as soon as they discovered it themselves. Third, several NGOs, both global like the U.S.-based Association for Progressive Communications, and national like IBASE in Brazil or the Red Cientifica Peruana in Peru, built on universities and other early knowledge bases about the Internet to focus their operations on bringing the Internet as an organizing tool to a wide range of other NGOs and social movements. These NGOs trained people in how to use the Internet for networking and organizing, trained them in the technical use of the Internet, created and operated non-profit ISPs, and created models almost like non-profit franchises, for how to set up small cybercafes or telecenters.\\nWithin these general approaches, there were an interesting variety of approaches, both early in the late 1980s-early 1990s and in the late 1990s to present. This paper concentrates on several cases within Brazil and on the Red Cientifica Peruana in Peru. The study finds that approaches have depended in large measure on the availability of telecommunications and ISP infrastructure. Those in turn depend on both government regulation of telecommunications and developments within private industry in telecommunications and Internet Service Provision.\\nCivil society in Peru had more open space to use Internet. Telecom use was more open to small businesses. RCP quasi franchise model could multiply freely. Even after privatization, Telefonica left the market open to small business rather than occupying it itself, so a space was created in which many small access centers, called cabinas publicas, flourished. Brazil had more directive policy. Brazilian telecommunication development was more directly driven by corporate and state interest. Both telecom and ISP market were quickly occupied by larger businesses. Bythe mid-1990s, however it became clear that Internet access needs by poorer people were not being met, so state and local governments, as well as NGOs have begun to create a number of telecenters.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper draw on research conducted for a recently completed PhD dissertation that explores the realm of cultural production associated with graphic design, understood in this context as a ubiquitous, yet largely invisible, communicative practice that nevertheless contributes substantially to the make-up of our visual culture. In doing so it invokes the conceptual apparatus of Pierre Bourdieu, particularly the notions of \\'habitus,\\' and the (middle) class fraction he labels the \\'cultural intermediaries\\' (or \"no collar\" - as opposed to white collar). In this paper I focus on defining, elaborating and ultimately complicating the notion of habitus as it applies to the professional milieu of graphic design in North America. The alternative perspective thereby developed - and informed most tellingly by strands of feminist thought - allows for the comparative evaluation of various high profile graphic design interventions versus less celebrated, but rather more numerous, instances of graphic dissent.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hong Kong is very much a part of mainland China -- physically, geographically, culturally, politically, and economically. On the other hand, because of its role as a British colony for 150 years, Hong Kong is about as different from the rest of mainland China as it could possibly be.\\n\\nAround the time of the so-called Handover at midnight on June 30, 1997, Hong Kongers went through a severe identity crisis. Did their loyalties -- and their cultural identities -- lie with the British, who provided Hong Kongers with all the rights and privileges associated with Western democracies? Or did they lie with the Chinese motherland, the last, great Communist totalitarian regime on earth?\\n\\nFruit Chan, an independent filmmaker in Hong Kong with a distinctive directorial style, dealt with the Hong Kong identity crisis in a series of films called The Handover Trilogy -- \"Made in Hong Kong\" (1997), \"The Longest Summer\" (1998), and \"Little Cheung\" (1999). This paper takes both a long view of the cultural identity of Hong Kongers and a close-up view based on the work of Fruit Chan, specifically The Handover Trilogy. It will attempt to show how cultural identities influence film portrayals of cultural identities, while the images in films reflect and reinforce these identities.',\n",

This essay discusses several issues related to Nigeria\\x92s market liberalization goals by reviewing industry history, analyzing the reform decrees and key reform activities. In the end, it discusses what needs to be done in order to meet all the stated goals.\\nIn 1992, Nigeria had issued a Decree to liberalize its telecommunications market that had long been under the control of government monopoly. To be sure, the Nigerian government, then under military dictatorship, had sought to hold firmly to government-control of telecommunications despite pressures, both internally and externally, for liberalization. It changed its policies only when it was compelled to believe that liberalization would be the key to the following: quickening telecommunications development, bringing in a massive infusion of cash to government coffers, and the beginning of the development of a telecommunications manufacturing base. There were several key liberalization strategies to achieving those goals including attracting technically capable market entrants, ensuring an enabling competitive and stable marketplace, and convincing investors about the market\\x92s profitability.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Objective Rejection?: Argument Quality Assessment and Involvement',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"Research investigating the role involvement and message strength in persuasion has demonstrated that the effectiveness of any message depends, in part, upon whether the individual is involved with the attitude object and whether the message is strong or weak (Petty & Cacciopo, 1986). Drawing from ELM research, social judgment theory research, and other persuasion literature, Johnson and Eagly (1989) conducted important meta-analyses of the effects of involvement on persuasion. In 1994, Johnson continued this research by integrating the work of Wood and her colleagues, (Wood, Kallgren, & Preisler, 1985; Wood, 1982) regarding the effects of knowledge on persuasion. Taken as a whole, research on knowledge, experience, and involvement has produced some crucial insights into what variables influence the relative strength of an argument or its ability to lead to persuasion.\\nAlthough consensus has not arisen, research utilizing the functional theory of persuasion has delineated various underlying functions, including the social adjustment, value-expressive, object appraisal or utilitarian or knowledge, the experiential, and the ego defensive functions (Katz, 1960; Smith, Bruner, & White, 1957; Snyder & DeBono, 1985; Herek, 1987; Shavitt, 1989; Maio & Olson, 2000; LaFrance & Boster, 2001; Lapinski & Boster, 2001, Hullett, 2002). More recent research on involvement has incorporated functional research in order to address differing types of involvement and the effects differing levels of involvement (Lavine & Snyder, 2000; Maio & Olson, 2000; Petty & Wegener, 1998; Liberman & Chaiken, 1996; Lavine & Snyder, 1996; Zuwerink & Devine, 1996; Maio & Olson, 1995; Johnson, 1994). Furthermore, argument strength and argument quality have been discussed and delineated in order to clarify whether the effectiveness of an argument in persuading is directly related to the individual assessment of the argument\\x92s inherent quality (Lavine & Snyder, 2000; 1996; Zuwerink & Devine, 1996; DeBono & Packer, 1991). It may be concluded that the attitude object and the individual\\x92s involvement with that attitude object influences the individual\\x92s assessment of argument quality, and subsequently affects persuasion.\\nThis manuscript investigates whether argument quality assessment is affected by different types of involvement or attitude function (knowledge, experience, social adjustive, and value) and level of involvement or issue importance. Although a considerable amount of research suggests that type of involvement and that level of involvement effects attitude change (Lavine & Snyder, 2000; Petty & Wegener, 1998; Maio & Olson, 1995; Johnson & Eagly, 1989), the relationship of involvement type and level has not been systematically investigated in light of argument quality assessment. Given that argument quality assessment plays an important intermediate step between the message and persuasion (Hullett, 2002; Fazio, 2000; Lavine & Snyder, 2000; 1996; DeBono & Packer, 1991), a clear understanding of whether attitude function and involvement level effect the individual\\x92s assessment of argument quality would be valuable.\\nMETHOD\\nFifteen participants completed the pilot instrument. Twenty-seven attitude objects were pre-tested in order to find attitude objects that demonstrated a high degree of functional consensus (Herek, 2000) as well as a high standard deviation in overall agreement with the topic area\\x92s directional statement in order to be able to compare high and low agreement individuals. Participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement on seven-point Likert scales with statements matching their attitude with a function (i.e. \\x93this issue is informed by my values/morals) as well as their level of issue importance.\\nBased upon the criteria of functional consensus and variance in overall agreement, three attitude objects were chosen for each of the four functional categories, resulting in twelve total attitude objects. A separate group of 16 participants were asked to generate pro and counter attitudinal arguments that would be relevant to the functional consensus. For example, participants generated arguments for and against human cloning with the intent of making them relevant to a person\\x92s values. From the resulting list of arguments, a pro-attitudinal and counter-attitudinal argument was chosen that appeared to be relevant to the target function. At this point, a topic area was eliminated from each of the four categories due to the lack arguments generated that were functionally relevant. Human cloning and homosexual Boy Scout troop leaders were chosen as value relevant topic areas. DNA testing for death row inmates and payment of college athletes were chosen as the knowledge relevant topic areas. The experiential topic areas chosen were required group projects for university classes and a reduced drinking age to 18. Finally, the social function relevant topic areas were the educational benefits of international travel and free health care to elderly.\\nThis project is currently in the data collections stage. We expect approximately 100 participants to complete the study instrument. Twenty participants have completed the instrument, and a complete analysis of all results will be available in the near future. Participants were given (and will be given) the same pilot test questionnaire regarding functional consensus and importance as in the pilot study to determine if the issues were perceived as functionally relevant, as well as to ensure that the manipulation was successful. Participants were asked to rate the quality of a pro-attitudinal and a counter-attitudinal argument about each topic area using a schematic differential scale measuring argument quality convincing/not convincing, logical/illogical, compelling/not compelling, and easy to argue against/hard to argue against (LaFrance & Boster, 2001).\\nDISCUSSION DIRECTIONS\\nAnalysis of the 20 completed instruments indicates that the functional manipulation was probably successful, and that the argument quality assessment will probably be able to be analyzed as a composite. The goal of analysis will focus on two primary research questions; does the level of personal importance of a issue affect an individual\\x92s assessment of argument quality and does the perception that a topic is informed by a specific function affect an individual\\x92s assessment of argument quality. The examination of these questions will advance the study of persuasion, especially in the areas of objective argument quality assessment and functions and issue importance.\\n\\nDeBono, K.

       "  'title': 'Online Privacy as Legal Safeguard: The Relationship Among Consumer, Online Portal, and Privacy Policies',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The advent of information technologies has raised public concern regarding privacy, as documented by the results of several surveys. While several European Union member countries must follow strict and specific regulations that protect consumer privacy, the United States has followed a privacy policy of self-regulation; thus, individual companies themselves devise formulas for ensuring customer privacy online. As borders designed to protect the consumer, online privacy statements seldom provide explicit reassurance that consumer information will be kept confidential and will not be exploited. In this study, we focus on online privacy and investigate how consumer information is protected or exposed by online portal sites. Building on a previous content analysis, which found that privacy statements do not always protect customer interests as much as they serve as legal safeguards for the companies involved, we propose a textual analysis designed to supplement and strengthen our previous findings. We undertake this study because, whether or not consumers read these statements, they provide evidence of the internet industry\\'s self protective efforts at the expense of consumer privacy of information.\\nPublic discourse about the cultural impact of information technology often focuses on privacy concerns. The Pew Internet & American Life Project reveals that 701f Internet users call for new laws to protect consumer privacy online (Fox and Lewis, 2001). Advanced data mining technologies have led to the proliferation of consumer database and management enterprises. Personal data is now a tradable commodity in capitalist societies (Hamelink, 2000), placing free market principles and privacy protection at odds with one another. Since digitally stored data can have an indefinite life span, public concern over the ability to control our own information is evident in consumer reluctance to provide personal data to online businesses (Fox and Lewis, 2001; Elgesem, 1996).\\nWhether or not consumer anxiety about information gathering is warranted, the online industry has responded to public concern and consumer advocacy efforts with voluntarily posted privacy statements to alleviate those concerns. Although governed by suggested industry guidelines, these privacy statements seldom provide explicit reassurance that consumer information will be kept confidential and will not be exploited. Instead, they frequently outline how companies intend to use private customer information so that, in the event of consumer complaints, the companies are absolved of responsibility. Companies such as Microsoft Passport Services are known for exploiting consumer information, and were finally pressured into revising their privacy policies and statements following a series of articles originating from Salon.com. Both Yahoo\\'s and Microsoft\\'s Hotmail email services reportedly divulged customer information in opposition to their stated privacy policies not to share personally identifiable information (Gillis, 2002).\\nOnline privacy statements are often placed inconveniently at the bottom of the page and are often tedious, complex, and replete with legal language the average web user finds difficult to comprehend. Kandra (2001) finds that many of the security statements of e-tailers sound reassuring, but offer very little protection to the individual consumer. Additionally, web users often find privacy policies difficult to trust (Reagle & Cranor, 1999). Building on this evidence, we examine privacy statements posted by online companies to determine whether they effectively protect personally identifiable and non-identifiable data. A discourse analysis of privacy statements could provide in-depth analysis of privacy statement content, and examine how portals use statements to guarantee personal information privacy and/or legally protect themselves. Because this is ultimately a policy question, a discourse analysis would allow the detailed examination of language, both legal and technical, contained within these statements to determine how a document designed to guarantee consumer privacy protection transforms into a company legal safeguard. Qualitative textual analysis techniques (following Fairclough, 1995; 2000 and van Dijk, 1997) seek a deep explanation of meaning through the observation and interpretation of patterns displayed in a mediated text (web portal privacy statements in this study). Textual discourse analysis lends an empirical grounding to the abstract observations about the social character of language and its cultural functions offered by social theory (Fairclough, 2000). A sample of web portals chosen from phase I of this study are analyzed.\\nThis work examines discourse (as defined by Fairclough) as a text. Fairclough characterizes discourse analysis as an examination of texts or language in concordance with the thematic structure of the text and speech. This interpretation of textual characteristics considers speech practices and sociocultural practices embedded within the text. Thus, the aim of discourse analysis, according to Fairclough, is to clarify the \"systematic links between texts, discourse practices, and sociocultural practices\" (1995, p. 17). Similarly, van Djik\\'s (1997) stated purpose of discourse analysis is to study texts \"not only as form, meaning and mental process, but also as complex structures and hierarchies of interaction and social practice and their functions in context, society and culture\" (p. 6). For the purposes of this research, discourse will encompass written language in the text of the privacy sections in the sample of web sites. The unit of analysis in this study is the relation between two themes within the online text: consumer protection and legal safeguards for the web company. It examines the legal and computer-oriented vocabulary, grammar and syntax, and organization of web sites to interpret the meaning of the use of privacy in terms of the data-sharing practices of the companies who own the sites. It examines assumptions about rights, concepts of privacy, and data mining. Specifically, this research asks: to what extent does the language in online privacy statements serve to protect and reassure the consumer while allowing the web company to sell and mine consumer information? Are abstruse legal and computer terms used to confuse the consumer in order to obscure the company\\'s data sharing policies? What terminology do these sites use to maximize their own protection while reassuring the user? These statements will be analyzed in terms of policy considerations for the protection of personally identifiable consumer information.\\nBuilding on a previous content analysis conducted by the authors, we hope that this study will expose the vulnerability of the privacy statement as a method of privacy protection. Constant technological changes and the interlocked nature of new media ownership combined with the miniscule number of users who ever notice or even read these statements further challenge the effectiveness of this instrument and indicate that privacy protection should involve more direct and legislative measures. Focusing on the use of language will help understand the process through which private information is compromised under the guise of offering personalized and improved services. We hope that this research would lend support to the FTC\\'s recommendation for a legislative solution to online privacy concerns rather than industry-driven privacy initiatives.\\n\\nReferences\\nElgesem, Dag.

       "  'abstract': 'The paper examines the literature on the concentration of ownership in American communications and the central question of media diversity. It is a think-piece that analyzes a good deal of the empirical studies on ownership, examines antitrust doctrine, and discusses a lot of the relevant court cases and FCC policy history. Among other things, the paper traces how a long-standing, but vague commitment to diversity on the part of the FCC (understood primarily as a diversity of viewpoints) got invigorated and reformulated by the civil rights movement in the late 1960s. By the early 1970s, diversity was understood as the ownership of media properties (particularly broadcast stations) by racial minorities and the FCC deployed minority preference policies to facilitate that outcome. But the change in equal protection jurisprudence that cast doubt on the constitutionality of minority preferences has also meant that diversity policy in broadcasting and media in general is now looked at with much suspicion by the appellate courts. This change in equal protection analysis (obviously abetted by the Reagan revolution), along with the growth in media and consequent claims regarding \\x93substitutability\\x94 (abetted by the ideology of deregulation), underlay the recent moves to do away with most FCC media ownership restrictions. The paper takes issue with the metaphor of the \\x93marketplace of ideas\\x94 and suggests that we replace it in favor of the metaphor of a \\x93mixed media system.\\x94',\n",

Two parallel studies were conducted, one which advocated flossing (N = 196), the other of which urged students to limit their alcohol intake (N = 200). In both cases, a composite index of anger and negative cognitions fully mediated the effects of threat-to-freedom and trait reactance proneness on attitude and intention. The data showed that, in fact, reactance can be operationalized as a composite of self-report indices of anger and negative cognitions. The implications for persuasive health communication, in general, are considered as well the specific findings for flossing and drinking.',\n",

Scheufele and Shah (2000) found that opinion leadership, or personality strength, is linked to civic engagement both directly and indirectly, mediated by various communication variables. However, they do not offer a complete theoretical account explaining the nature of these influences that relates them to the specific patterns of media use that foster participation. Accordingly, we explicate the construct of opinion leadership, outline it causes and consequences, and then examine hypothesized relationships using data from a large national survey conducted in 1998. We examine opinion leadership as an endogenous variable within a structural equation model. Our analyses show that opinion leadership is less a function of demographic variables than a number of psychological factors related to levels of self-esteem and confidence in one\\x92s own abilities. In addition, we find opinion leaders are strategic in their media use, with television hard news use prompting newspaper hard news use and subsequent on-line information search. Particularly important, the link between opinion leadership and media use is largely mediated by interest in politics, which triggers information seeking across all types of media. In turn, interest in politics, newspaper reading, and on-line searching are significant direct predictors of civic engagement. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.',\n",

Service providers who experienced more positive communication relationships with their supervisors, coworkers, and customers tended to be more satisfied with their job, more committed to their organization, and less burned out. Only their communication relationships with customers predicted their turnover intentions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper we assess scholarship about new media and organizational discourse from a practice perspective. While this scholarship in the last twenty years has yielded valuable contributions, we argue that its current innovative capacity lies behind that of both technology production and use. More precisely, we identify three issues which we believe a) are relatively under-developed in the current state of the literature, b) have become particularly problematic in the light of contemporary organizational and technological innovations, and c) may benefit from a practice perspective. These issues revolve around a relatively narrow characterization of context, an atomized view of communication processes, and a compartmentalization of technology?s discursive potentials. Based on an analysis of these limitations, we outline a programmatic statement suggesting how a more practice-oriented understanding of the recursive interaction between people, new media, and organizational discourse contributes to overcoming these shortcomings. We contend that by focusing on the everyday activities of situated actors, a practice orientation can provide insights into the dynamic, emergent, and enacted nature of organizational discourse as it unfolds through a complex array of new and evolving media.',\n",

Results point to both the reliability and validity of the new measures. Another study designed to determine the association of orientations with temperament, ob satisfaction, and subordinates\\' perceptions of the credibility of their supervisors also is reported.

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper we examine the relationship between discourse and organization. It is a relationship of growing interest in organizational studies as organizations are increasingly framed as discursive constructions. However, such framing appears subject to at least three orientations. First, an organization may be cast as an already formed object with discourse central to the features and outcomes of organizing. Second, organizations may be seen in a perpetual state of becoming through the ways that the properties of discourse shape organizing. Finally, organizations and discourse may be cast as a duality that is mutually constituted. Moreover, each of these three orientations provides a different cast to the terms discourse and Discourses. We use these interpretations and different notions about discourse to explore the research traditions on language and social interaction. We contend that all three orientations are necessary and should operate simultaneously to reveal a complex view of the organizational-discourse relationship, one that is discerning of the strengths and shortcomings of discourse as a metaphor of organizations.',\n",

Also, individuals with traditional attitudes about same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception are negatively related to tabloid use, because their views are not reinforced there.

Therefore, people are using tabloids as part of their overall media consumption, for both diversionary purposes and as a means to seek information.

Different strands of research and theory are cited in support of this argument: after a discussion of the essentialist/\\nconstructionist debate, the focus turns to sociological work on the construction of homosexuality, on the legitimation of violence, and on the connection between masculine gender norms and homophobia. The paper then considers the role of (mis)interpretation of biblical scripture as a basis for anti-gay ideology, and concludes with a review of a psychological study of the motivations of incarcerated anti-gay assailants which supports the paper's thesis.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Consonant media coverage, i.e., a very similar presentation and evaluation of issues in all media of a particular country, is usually considered to bring about powerful media effects. Though plausible, this notion has hardly been put to test. Similarly, we know little about media effects on attitudes towards European integration. This study pulls these two research strands together. It is investigated whether consonant coverage affects attitudes towards European integration by linking, at the individual level, content analytic measures to survey data in 13 European countries. If the media in a particular country evaluated EU representatives similarly (i.e., consonantly), then these evaluations positively affected people's attitudes towards further European integration. This effect was boosted by the visibility of EU representatives. Conversely, if the media in a particular country evaluated EU representatives dissonantly, then no effect of the coverage emerged. Cognitive selection mechanisms did not protect EU citizens from the influence of consonant media coverage, which indicates powerful media effects. The findings suggest that media effects should not be omitted when dealing with attitudes towards European integration. Moreover, the results imply that media effects research may, under certain circumstances, benefit from the 'concept of powerful mass media'.\",\n",

Although the traditional model of voting behavior points to the importance of the psychological factors at an individual level, it fails to explain whether and how the importance of the vote determinants varies depending on other factors during the course of an election campaign. Drawing on priming theory, this paper attempts to test how television news use and interpersonal discussion on politics moderate individuals¡¯ voting behavior. Based on previous discussion about television news¡¯ emphasis on candidates¡¯ character and political homogeneity in interpersonal discussion, it was hypothesized that television news use will promote candidate image-based voting, and interpersonal political discussion will encourage party-based voting. Results largely support these hypotheses. In the 2000 election, candidate character (i.e., competence and personal quality) and party identification were primed by television and interpersonal discussion respectively whereas policy issues have been muted by television news.

       "  'abstract': 'The motives to adopt new media, as exemplified by Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), were assessed in a uses and gratifications survey. To define motives of new media use, a preliminary qualitative study was administered. Diffusion research and the theory of play were considered to explain motives for adopting new media. Survey results suggest three gratification dimensions: playful exploration, status and function-related motives. Consumer innovativeness was taken into account as a personal predisposition toward new media use. Although the predictive power of gratifications was weak, the motive to play, first introduced by this study, was a highly ranked gratification. The results related to this dimension provide new insights into media adoption.',\n",

The theoretical position that human information processing involves a limited capacity system has been used to demonstrate that listening performance is retarded by increasing levels of cognitive load. Similarly, it is argued that increases in cognitive backlog during listening will lead to altered levels of anxiety during a listening task. As predicted, anxiety levels are observed to grow during listening performance. This pattern contrasts markedly with patterns observed for public speaking. In addition, decreases in affect for the listening task are observed, along with an unusual pattern of correlations between anxiety and listening performance.',\n",

Sexual orientation (heterosexual), topic of the disease (cancer), respondent sex (female) and target person sex (female) emerged as stronger predictors of outgroup homogeneity effects. That is, female respondents perceived more homogeneity in female target persons, heterosexuals and people with cancer. In addition, interaction effects were found for respondent sex and target person sexual orientation such that female respondents perceived heterosexuals as being more similar on all four dimensions of outgroup homogeneity effect.

This study examines those underlying values and looks at how values are reflected in the professional roles endorsed by editors and reporters.

Hypotheses and research questions were generated based on an integrated theoretical model of message processing and outcome. Formative research was conducted to investigate the construct of message cognition value and to evaluate anti-marijuana messages designed to vary on sensation and cognition value. In the experiment, 338 18-20 year old college students viewed 4 anti-marijuana public service announcements 4 times each over a 4-week period in a laboratory setting. They completed measures of sensation seeking (NFS), need for cognition (NFC), cognitive processing, attitudes toward marijuana use, behavioral intention to use marijuana and self-reported marijuana use. Results are consistent with previous research showing effects for message sensation value (MSV) on attitude, behavioral intention and behavior. Additionally, a significant main effect for message cognition value (MCV) indicates that high cognition value messages led to greater cued recall than low cognition value messages. This effect was particularly evident among high need for cognition individuals. Message cognition value did not have a main effect on attitude, behavioral intention or behavior. Need for cognition moderated the effect of message cognition value on attitude, but not behavioral intention or behavior. Interaction effects involving NFC/MCV and NFS/MSV were not found. Implications of results for future research and theory development are discussed.',\n",

To what degree and for which types of issues can we observe a domestication of issues?\\n3. How does the news geography relate to issues and persons in media coverage?\\n4. Do common topics in the coverage in different countries exist that may indicate a topical integration across different nations?\\nFor the empirical study, prime time news shows of 18 TV stations in eight European countries (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Norway, France, Spain, Italy) and the USA were taped for seven consecutive days in winter 1998/1999. Fieldwork was done by multilingual coding teams at the University of Munich, Germany. The results give some insight into the specific news selection processes - with an identical historical situation forming the background of coverage.',\n",

As in a previous study using college students, animated graphics elicited the most attention while redundant text graphics elicited the least. Yet, as in the previous study, redundant text graphics elicited higher skin conductance levels than either the animated graphics or no graphics conditions. As in the previous study, the graphics enhanced recognition for harder stories more so than for easier stories. Delayed cued recall in both studies was best for stories with animated graphics and worst for stories with no graphics. The graphic conditions did not affect free recall of information in the previous study. But for these older participants both redundant and animated graphics aided free recall for stories that participants rated as being harder to understand, and animated graphics also aided free recall for easier stories.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the first implementation of technology in academic libraries, the computer has affected all phases of library operation. College and university libraries are undergoing profound and undoubtedly permanent changes. Research reveals that technological change has a different impact on women workers than it has on men; it shapes the way in which work is conducted and by whom. What, then, are the implications for academic libraries, where the workforce is predominately female? This paper attempts to address this question. We begin with a history of technology and libraries to provide a context for the reader. Next, we review the literature in two areas: 1) gender and technology in the workplace, and 2). gender in libraries. Evidence for the relationship of shifting gender roles due to the introduction of technology in academic libraries is supported by three studies. First, examination of data provided by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics suggests that the gender composition of libraries is changing. Second, the results of a pilot study on technology and gender in academic libraries supports the hypothesis that men are increasingly occupying technology-based positions which include higher salaries and access to administration which improves their status and empowers them to make or influence decisions. Finally, the results of a survey in one academic library suggest that although male and female librarians and library workers are equally likely to have to use technology extensively in their positions, men are less likely than women to recognize as women as technology experts.',\n",

Young adults viewed a 35 minute video excerpt and then evaluated the depiction of either the lead male or lead female character. Male participants agreed with conventional sex role stereotypes more than female participants and found the male superhero to be a positive role model for children. Though neither males nor females believed the female lead character was a good role model, this effect was significantly stronger for females. Androgynous participants liked both characters significantly more than participants who measured high in masculinity and femininity. A significant relationship was observed between conventional sex stereotypes and the extent to which participants recognized sex stereotyping in character depiction. In addition, males indicated greater approval for allowing both their daughters and their sons to watch this program. The effects of academic major and race on stereotyping are also analyzed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A play model of communication processes in chat rooms is proposed that goes beyond motivational explanations of chat use and completes them. Using Goffman\\'s frame analysis, the model explains why the anonymous and not binding nature of chat communication does not lead to a total disrespect of social conventions. Fundamental elements of conventional games (Linder / Roos/ Victor 2001; Sutton-Smith 1997) are applied to chat communication and substantiated in an empirical study combining observational and think-aloud procedures. The chat play deals with identity: The players in the chat room aim at revealing the identity of their fellow players and at the same time, at managing their own identity. The term \"identity\" is confined to key aspects of the physical appearance like age, gender, status and attractiveness. In face-to-face-situations, these attributes provide first impressions on a person - in chat rooms, however, conversations have to make do without these basic personal cues. Thus chatters try to solve the riddle of the other chatters\\' identities, and, in turn, ask them riddles about their own. However, the mere knowledge of the others\\' identities is not gratifying: What really produces pleasure is an inventive and creative use of language and a knowledgeable way of composing threads. \"Expert chatters\" excel in their strategic communication skills: Their active, speedy and inventive style in chatting makes them attractive conversational partners. Those who do not master these strategies, or disrespect fundamental social conventions are ignored and barred from play and its pleasure.',\n",

This study is an empirical examination of Elliot and Culver\\x92s definition of journalistic deception that departs from the focus on undercover work, hidden cameras and impersonation. In a Web-based survey with 740 journalists, competition and medium emerge as the two most salient predictors of deception tolerance. Journalists who view competition to be an important consideration in ethical decision-making are more tolerant of deception. Television journalists have a higher tolerance of deception than print journalists. The salience of competition and medium demonstrates how ethical decision-making is a function of occupational pressures as journalists negotiate the tensions between morality and professional demands. A regression analysis reveals that the newsroom environment, rather than individual-level variables, is the most important force shaping journalists\\x92 assessment of deception.',\n",

It first compares various types of presence-related terms (e.g., telepresence, virtual presence, mediated presence, co-presence, and presence) and suggests that the term, presence, works best for the systematic study of human interaction with media and simulation technologies. After extensive explication processes, presence is newly defined as \\x93the psychological state in which the virtuality of experience is unnoticed.\\x94 Three types of presence\\x97physical, social, and self presence\\x97are categorized based on corresponding domains of human experience. Conceptual definition of each type of presence is made following the general definition of presence. Finally, implications of the current explication to the study of presence are discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Third-person perception is the notion that media affects others more than oneself, whereas first-person perception is the opposite; the belief that oneself is more affected by media than others. Meta-analyses have revealed that a robust third-person perception exists, thus researchers have turned their interests to examining the conditions under which third- and first-person perceptions occur. This study examines the role of presence (i.e. perceiving the television experience as more intense and real) in moderating the third-person perception, specifically investigating the reversal of a third-person perception to first-person perception. Because presence has been described as a psychological state that can be induced given the \\x93right\\x94 media conditions, and with minimal cues, then experiencing increased presence may be a situation in which television viewers describe themselves as being more affected. As such, presence should diminish the third person perception. A random phone survey of 402 adults confirmed a third-person perception of television\\x92s estimated impact on thinking and feeling. However, as predicted, an increased sense of presence diminished the third person perception, apparently allowing viewers to admit to the effect of television',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"While tobacco-related media content, both pro- and anti-smoking content, is widely believed to have a significant direct influence on adolescent decisions about smoking, the processes that may underlie this influence are neither well documented nor well understood. Particularly notable is the absence of evidence that anti-smoking campaigns achieve their intended effect. However, what does have a significant and well-documented effect on smoking adoption are adolescent perceptions of peer norms.\\nThis study examined the role of peer norms and mass media in a test of the presumed influence hypothesis, a theoretical model suggesting that smoking-related media content may have a significant indirect influence on adolescent smoking via its effect on perceived peer norms. That is, adolescents may assume that smoking-related content in mass media will influence the attitudes and behaviors of their peers (even if not their own). These peer perceptions in turn can influence adolescents' own smoking behaviors.\\nResults of a pilot study of 129 middle-school students showed no direct effect of either pro- or anti-smoking promotions. But pro-smoking messages had a significant indirect influence through their perceived effect on peers. Most interestingly, anti-smoking campaigns were associated with perceptions of increased pro-smoking attitudes and behaviors among peers, thus compounding, rather than counteracting, the substantial influence of peer norms on smoking adoption.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Priming and Stereotyping: How Mediated Images Affect Perceptions in Interpersonal Contexts',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"Priming and Stereotyping:\\nHow Mediated Images Affect Perceptions in Interpersonal Contexts\\nMedia represents an important mechanism for members of different social, cultural and ethnic groups to learn about each other. Storylines about social groups enable viewers to develop knowledge structures about these social groups which include information about their personality traits (e.g., aggressive), behaviors (e.g., talks loud ), and social status (e.g., uneducated). This particular function of media is often described as the reinforcement of social stereotypes (Fujioka, 1999; Wilson & Gutierrez, 1996). The present research examines how stereotypical portrayals of African American women in media significantly influence perceptions of African American women in interpersonal contexts.\\nThe activation-recency hypothesis proposed by Hansen and Hansen (1988) suggests that individuals who are primed with media content are more likely to use the content for subsequent information processing than those not primed. Ford (1997) used the activation-recency hypothesis to test whether stereotypic portrayals of African Americans increase the likelihood that European Americans will make negative social judgments of an African American target person. Stereotypic and neutral comedy skits involving African American characters were used as priming stimuli. Participants viewed the skits and afterward were instructed to read a vignette describing a legal case in which a student was accused of physical assault. Ford found that the priming resulted in greater attributions of guilt for the perceived African American offender than the European American offender. Hansen and Hansen argue that participants transfer knowledge that is obtained via the media to other contexts because \\x93the distorted appraisal of a subsequent stimulus induced by activation is unlikely to be consciously corrected\\x94 (p. 290). In other words, we are not likely to watch a situation comedy above African-Americans and consciously correct the impressions we form of African-Americans from that television show.\\nPrevious research has failed to explore within group differences in stereotyping and instead comparisons have focused on between group racial differences. For example, most of the comparisons in the stereotyping literature are between blacks and whites (see e.g., Dijksteruis & van Knippenberg, 1998; Dovidio, Kawakami, Johnson, Johnson & Howard, 1997; Fazio, Jackson, Dunton & Williams, 1995; Spencer, Fein, Wolfe, Fong & Dunn, 1998). In this paper, we examine for both between group differences (e.g., black vs white) and also within group differences (e.g., different African-American female stereotypes). We hypothesize that mediated images of African American women activate a specific African American female schema and make it salient for subsequent information processing.\\nA considerable amount of research on social schemas suggests that the mental models we hold of others contain very complicated knowledge structures (Brewer, 2000). Collins (1991) argues that African American women have historically been portrayed by mediated institutions (e.g., television) as nurturing-asexual mammies, domineering matriarchs, sexually aggressive jezebels, and lazy welfare mothers. Collins, along with other cultural critics, contends that the salience of these popular forms negatively contribute to the ways African American women are perceived and the conditions under which they are accepted in society (Bogle, 2001, Dines & Humez, 1995; Gray, 1991; 1995; Omi & Winant ,1986; Wilson & Gutierrez, 1996). Thus, we expect that participants primed with a specific African American female stereotype will evaluate another African American woman as more consistent with that stereotype. For example, participants primed with a mammy stereotype should rate another African American woman as more nurturing compared to those primed with a jezebel stereotype.\\nH1a: Exposure to stereotypic portrayals of an African American woman will result in stereotype consistent judgments of another African American woman.\\nH1b: Response times will be faster to stereotype consistent adjectives than to stereotype inconsistent adjectives after viewing a mediated image of an African American woman.\\nWhile our first hypotheses focus on within group stereotype differences, a considerable body of knowledge suggests that media portrayals of African Americans are often automatically perceived as \\x93hostile,\\x94 \\x93dangerous,\\x94 \\x93lazy,\\x94 and \\x93stupid\\x94 (Dijksteruis & van Knippenberg, 1998; Fazio, Jackson, Dunton & Williams, 1995; Wittenbrink, Judd & Park, 1997). This literature suggests that regardless of the specific stereotype primed, the mere presence of an African American triggers a negative affective response. Devine (1989), for example, argues that we are all aware of the social perceptions of African Americans as generally \\x93bad\\x94 in the sense that the social category \\x93Black/African American\\x94 connotes negativity. Greenwald and Banaji (1995), on the other hand, argue that these subtle associations not only reflect knowledge of the stereotypes but a belief in them as well. Gaertner and Dovidio\\x92s (1986) Aversive Racism framework supports this view by suggesting that associating African Americans with negativity illustrates a latent form of racism, which can enable an individual with an egalitarian self-image to behave in prejudicial yet rationalizable ways. They argue that these types of association are a reflection of personal beliefs, even in cases where indicators of more overt forms of racism are absent. Whether African Americans are associated with negative words quicker than are European Americans because of an underlying automatic categorization (Devine\\x92s perspective) or because such associations imply aversive racism (Gaertner & Dovidio), we expect to replicate these findings in the present research:\\nH2a: Response times will be faster to negative words and slower to positive words when evaluating an African American woman.\\nH2b: Response times will be faster to positive words and slower to negative words when evaluating a European American woman.\\nReaction times to negative words when evaluating an African American woman may be even faster when the individual sees two consecutive African American images. In the present study, individuals first view a film clip that portrays an African American woman in some stereotyped role or they view a control clip which does not portray an African American. In part two, they watch and evaluate either a European American or African American female in a job interview setting. Being primed with a televised image of an African American female in addition to viewing an African American interviewee may result in an additive effect whereby participants will make negative judgments fastest when they viewed both an African American female on the film clip and are evaluating an African American interviewee:\\nH3: Exposure to both a media portrayal of an African American woman and an African American woman interviewee will result in faster responses to negative judgments of the interviewee than will viewing the African American interviewee without the media portrayal.\\nMethods\\nA 4 (stereotype image: welfare mother, mammy, jezebel or no prime condition) x 2 (race of interviewee: African American or European American) between-subjects experimental design with both factors completely crossed is utilized. 260 undergraduate students between the ages of 18-29 from introductory speech communication courses will participate.\\nIndependent Variables\\nStereotype image. Participants in the stereotype image conditions view a two-minute videotaped segment of a movie where an African American actress played the role of welfare mother (taken from The Women of Brewster Place), mammy (taken from To Dance with a White Dog), or jezebel (taken from Introducing Dorothy Dandridge). In the control condition, participants view a time equivalent segment of a movie about the life of a European American male in high school (taken from Better off Dead). The three priming clips were extensively pilot tested to ensure participants viewed the clip as highly representative of the stereotype.\\nRace of interviewee. After viewing the priming tape, participants will observe one of two 3-minute interview tape involving a male interviewer and female interviewee in an employment interview scenario. The interviews are similar on all dimensions except for the race of the female interviewees (African American or European American). The male interviewer, who remains off camera, conducts both interview scenarios. The interview script was adapted from a set of job interview scripts (Wilson & Goodall, 1991).\\nDependent Variables\\nPositive, negative and stereotypic adjective associations. Fifty adjective words representing words associated with positive and negative African American stereotypes, welfare mother, mammy and jezebel stereotypes are used for the response time measures. The items for the positive and negative stereotypes were adapted from previous research examining response times to African American stereotypes (Bargh et al., 1995; Devine, 1989; Dovidio et al., 1997, Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). Words related to the welfare mother, mammy and jezebel stereotypes were taken from descriptions of the stereotypes (Bogle, 2001; Collins, 1991; Jones, 2000). Participants will assess whether a term \\x93fits\\x94 the person they observed on the interview tape. The speed at which participants associated the woman they observed on the interview tape with each adjective will be timed in milliseconds (Dijksterhuis & van Knippenberg, 1999; Greenwald & Banaji, 1995; Wittenbrink, Judd & Park, 1997).\\nJob suitability items. Participants respond to 40 items indicating how suitable the African American or European American female is for the position of sales representative that she was purportedly interviewing for using 1-7 Likert scales where 1 stands for strongly agree and 7 stands for strongly disagree.\\nProcedures\\nParticipants will be told they are participating in two unrelated mini-studies as neither study alone takes enough time to fulfill the research requirement. For the media prime manipulation (mini-study 1), participants will be told that we are currently trying to develop a visual aide library for instructors to utilize in the basic courses and we need their help in selecting appropriate clips for different constructs. After viewing the priming clip and answering questions about it, participants will then be moved to a different room. Participants will be told that the second study is about interviewing techniques. They will watch an interviewee and then critique the person\\x92s performance. After viewing the interview tape, participants then complete the adjective association response time task using Micro-Experimental Lab (MEL). The adjectives will be counterbalanced such that participants view them in order 1 or order 2. Participants will respond to the adjectives by hitting a \\x93YES\\x94 or \\x93NO\\x94 key. The \\x94YES\\x94 and \\x93NO\\x94 keys will be counterbalanced to reduce any effects due to the dominant hand always associated with one key (e.g., \\x93yes\\x94 always being the right hand key). Finally, participants will complete the job suitability items and then be debriefed and dismissed. Data collection for this project began in October.\\n\\nReferences\\nBargh, J.

These hypotheses were tested by way of a six-condition, between-participants experiment wherein female college students (N = 114) were randomly assigned to either a control condition (in which participants were not exposed to any version of the test) or one of five treatment conditions featuring the same basic purity test with concentrations of items pertaining to different sexual activities. Following this, a paper-and-pencil questionnaire elicited participants' perceptions of the prevalence of specific sexual activities among their peers. Results indicated that when interacting with variables such as prior sexual experience and views about premarital sex, purity test-taking does affect perceptions of specific sexual activity prevalence among peers.

The results also indicated that inoculation treatments elicit anger and reduce the number of positive responses to the attack message, which, in time, directly enhance resistance to the influence of persuasive attacks. In addition, results showed that issue involvement enhances counterarguing output which, in turn, directly fosters resistance. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that inoculation treatments trigger threat; however, elicited threat neither directly nor indirectly enhances resistance. This unexpected finding may be attributed to one of the topics selected, which failed to generate a high enough threat level as was generated in previous studies. Finally, structural equation modeling didn't reveal any path between inoculation and resistance, suggesting that anger, responses to the attack message, and counterarguing output may have accounted for most of the variance in participants' resistance to the influence of persuasive attacks. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Prior Knowledge as a Moderator of Fear Appeals\\nOver 50 years of fear appeal research still leaves us uncertain as to the conditions under which fear may effectively lead to adaptive attitude and behavior change. Theoretical emphasis has been placed on the relative weighting of threat and efficacy perceptions to understand adaptive versus maladaptive action (e.g., Rogers, 1975, Witte, 1992). While these perceptions are clearly important for the evocation of fear and potential responses, no fear appeal model based solely on these concepts is particularly well-supported by empirical research (Boster & Mongeau, 1984; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Mongeau, 1998; Witte, 1994). Although recent research has examined the effects of fear arousal on information processing, specifying the conditions that would lead to more or less careful message processing (Baron, Inman, Kao, & Logan, 1992; Baron, Logan, Lilly, Inman, & Brennan, 1994; Gleicher & Petty, 1992; Hale, LeMieux, & Mongeau, 1995; Jepson & Chaiken, 1990), prior knowledge, a variable that might impact perceptions of threat and efficacy, processing depth and style, and attitudes has yet to be considered in a fear appeal context.\\nExtant research has shown prior knowledge to impact persuasive outcome by promoting more systematic processing (Wood & Kallgren, 1988; Wood, Kallgren, & Preisler, 1985), stronger resistance to attitude change (Wood, 1982), and greater attitude-behavior consistency (Kallgren & Wood, 1986). Applying what is known about prior knowledge to fear appeal processes, two key effects are likely. First, topic-relevant knowledge should impact intensity of emotional arousal because the degree of uncertainty both in terms of threat and efficacy is constrained. Empirically this position is supported by Hoffner¡¦s (1997) research on children¡¦s fright reactions in which prior knowledge of the positive outcome of a film scene reduced facial expressions of fear as well as self-reported fear for those with a blunting coping style. Thus,\\nH1: Prior knowledge will be negatively associated with fear arousal.\\nAs to message processing, Biek, Wood, and Chaiken (1996) found negative affect to interact with knowledgeability such that highly-aroused, knowledgeable people engaged in more biased processing of new information on AIDS risk scenarios compared to other groups. This study, however, did not consider a) fear apart from other emotions, or b) how potentially familiar arguments are processed. It is likely that a message repeating generally familiar information (e.g., the dangers of smoking or not wearing sunscreen), particularly information intended to induce a negative affective state, would encourage reactance among more knowledgable subjects, and thus lower message acceptance. However, for those who are less knowledgable, potentially threatening information might be both more arousing and more accepted. Thus,\\nH2: For less knowledgable subjects, high fear messages will be more persuasive than low fear messages. For more knowledgable subjects, low fear messages will be more persuasive.\\nOf note, subjective, rather than accurate, knowledge is the construct of interest because, as Wood et al. (1995) note, perceptions and attitudes, themselves subjective, are more influenced by information that is subjectively meaningful.\\nMethod\\nThe study involved a 2 (Perceived Prior Knowledge: high vs. low) x 3 (Fear: high vs. low vs. control) x 2 (Message: testicular vs. breast cancer) between subjects design. Two hundred and sixty-three undergraduates, 55 0.000000emale and 45Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide characterale, participated. Women received messages and survey items specific to breast cancer whereas men received messages and questions specific to testicular cancer.\\nRespondents first completed a survey measuring general cancer anxiety (six items \\x83Ñ = .78), specific cancer anxiety (six items \\x83Ñ = .83), perceived cancer-specific knowledge (2 items, r = .74), and trait anxiety (20 items \\x83Ñ = .90). After an intermediate task, respondents read one of three messages (efficacy-only, low fear, high fear) about either breast or testicular cancer. The survey then measured message-evoked fear (6 items \\x83Ñ = .93), message processing depth (14 items \\x83Ñ = .92), defensive (7 items \\x83Ñ = .92) and adaptive reactions (4 items \\x83Ñ = .76), perceived severity and susceptibility, response efficacy (3 items \\x83Ñ = .67), and self-efficacy (4 items \\x83Ñ = .70). Attitude toward self-exams was assessed with 19, 7-point semantic differentials (range ¡V3 to 3; \\x83Ñ = .92). Behavioral intentions to perform self-exams were assessed with seven 7-point Likert items (range ¡V3 to 3; \\x83Ñ = .87). Demographics, including age, sex, ethnicity, year in school, past-self exam behavior, and family history of breast cancer (for women) or testicular cancer (for men) were assessed. For ANOVA analyses, knowledge was dichotomized based on median split.\\nResults\\nManipulation Check: Fear Arousal\\nAn ANOVA with fear arousal as the dependent measure indicated a main effect for message type, F(2, 255) = 13.51, p < .001, \\x83Ø2 = .10, a main effect for sex, F(1, 255) = 6.90, p < .01, \\x83Ø2 = .04, and a sex by message type interaction, F(2, 255) = 3.95, p < .05, \\x83Ø2 = .03. Specifically, the high fear group reported experiencing more fear than the low fear and efficacy-only groups (p < .001). Men experienced more fear than women (p < .05). Finally, the interaction indicated that men and women experienced comparable fear levels in response to the efficacy-only message, but men experienced more fear in response to the low and high fear messages than women. These data support a successful fear manipulation.\\nH1: Prior Knowledge and Fear Evocation\\nControlling for age, sex, family history of cancer, and past self-exam behavior, correlational analyses indicated a small significant, negative correlation between perceived knowledge level and fear arousal (r = -.12, p = .05, n = 250). This result supports H1.\\nH2: Prior Knowledge, Fear, and Persuasive Effect\\nA Message Type x Sex x Knowledge ANCOVA revealed a significant main effect for sex on attitudes toward self-exams, F(1, 245) = 7.94, p < .01, \\x83Ø2 = .03, indicating women had more favorable attitudes toward breast self-exams than men do toward testicular self-exams. As predicted, a significant interaction between knowledge level and message type, F(2, 245) = 3.41, p < .05, \\x83Ø2 = .03, indicated that there was essentially no difference in self-exam attitude across messages for those low in knowledge. However, the high knowledge groups had more favorable attitudes toward self-exams after receiving the efficacy-only, rather than the low or high fear messages. Importantly, a three-way interaction, F(2, 245) = 4.20, p < .05, \\x83Ø2 = .03, suggested that the 2-way interaction was primarily a function of differences for men, but not women.\\nThe 2-way and 3-way interaction did not appear when considering processing depth and self-exam intentions. However, a Knowledge x Message x Sex interaction was evidenced for defensive processing, F(2, 247) = 3.01, p = .05, \\x83Ø2 = .024, indicating that high knowledge men felt least manipulated by the efficacy-only message and most manipulated by the low and high fear messages whereas the low knowledgeable men found the high fear message to be the least manipulative. Of note, men found their messages more exaggerated than women did, F(1, 247) = 9.32, p < .01, \\x83Ø2 = .04.\\nThese results suggest that perceived knowledge level might not only minimize emotional reactions to fear appeals, but it may also impact perceptions of a message as overblown and exaggerated, and thus moderate its persuasive impact. Differences between the effects found for men and women, the absence of an effect for self-exam intentions, and the impact of knowledge on other variables measured will be addressed.\\nReferences\\nBaron, R.

In previous studies, they have been used interchangeably to indicate the existence of the displacement effect of a new medium on the older forms of media. This paper suggests that such undifferentiated use of the two variables can be problematic, in that media use is an objective measurement while media reliance, perceptual. Using the data from a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2000, this study compares the differences between media use and reliance in three aspects: demographic characteristics, knowledge, and individual interests. Findings of our study suggest that interests in different content areas as well as demographic variables including age, education, and income have different effects on media use and reliance. Moreover, media use and reliance have different effects on knowledge about current affairs.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"Processing Radio PSAs: Production Pacing, Arousing Content, and Age\\n\\n\\nThis study will examine how radio public service announcements (PSAs) are processed by college-age and tween (9-to-12 year old) listeners. Specifically, it will look at the effects of production pacing, arousing content, and age on listeners= physiological, cognitive, and emotional responses to substance abuse PSAs aired on the radio. The study builds on previous research with college-age and adolescent viewers on the effects of production pacing and arousing content on the processing of televised substance abuse PSAs. Thus, this study asks whether production pacing and arousing content in radio PSAs have the same effects on listeners that they do in televised PSAs. Secondly, it asks whether radio PSAs have the same effects on tweens that they do on college-age viewers.\\nThe study uses the limited capacity model of mediated message processing (Lang, 2000), which considers message processing to be the result of the interaction between the message\\x92s form and content and the message receiver\\x92s goals and interests. Both the form and content of a message can elicit automatic allocation of processing resources, while message receivers can control the allocation of resources by deciding how relevant, interesting, or familiar the message is. Because people are limited capacity processors, whenever the automatic and/or controlled demands for processing resources exceed the capacity of the message receiver, the system is overloaded and some aspect of processing is performed less well.\\nLimited capacity theory predicts that both faster pacing and arousing content will automatically elicit both self-reported feelings of arousal and physiological arousal. Previous research has supported these predictions (Hitchon, Thorson, & Duckler, 1994; Lang, Dhillon, & Dong, 1995; Lang, Newhagen, & Reeves, 1996; Lang, Bolls, Potter, & Kawahara, 1999; Lang, Schwartz, & Snyder, 1999). Thus, in this study it is predicted that:\\nH1: As production pacing increases, both self-reported and physiological arousal will increase.\\nH2: Arousing content will elicit greater self-reported and physiological arousal in listeners than calm content.\\nIn general, both voluntary and involuntary allocation of attention to an external stimulus leads to slower heart rates as the body is quieted in an effort to focus attention (Cacioppo & Tassinary, 1990). Research on television has shown slower heart rates during arousing television messages than during calm television messages (Lang et al., 1995; Lang et al., 1996; Thorson & Lang, 1992). We predict the same will be true with arousing and calm radio messages.\\nH3: Listeners will have slower heart rates during arousing messages than they will during calm messages.\\nPrevious research has also shown that increasing production pacing increases attentional effort as long as the processing system is not significantly overloaded. Thus when fast production pacing does not push viewers beyond overload, fast-paced messages appear to receive more attention than slow- and medium-paced messages. Once the system reaches the point of overload and viewers can no longer keep up with the message, however, they appear to expend less effort \\x96 the result being that they pay less attention to fast-paced messages than to slow- and medium-paced messages. In this study, it is expected that fast-paced messages will result in significant cognitive overload. Therefore:\\nH4: Heart rate should be relatively faster during fast-paced messages than during slow- and medium-paced messages.\\nPrevious research examining the effects of production pacing and arousing content on processing have suggested that there are no messages about risky products and substances that are not arousing (Lang, Lee, Chung, & Zhao, 2001). Thus, it is likely that both calm and arousing radio PSAs will push subjects into overload. However, cognitive overload will occur sooner (at a lower level of pacing) for arousing messages than for calm messages. Generally, overload is first seen as a decrease in recognition memory resulting from overload of the encoding process. Thus:\\nH5: There will be an interaction between Production Pacing and Arousing Content such that as pacing increases, recognition memory will increase to a point and then decrease, and this decrease in recognition will be greater for arousing messages than for calm messages.\\nFinally, in experiment one, subjects will be college-age students, and in experiment two the same stimuli will be used with tweens. This will allow us to find out if tweens show the same physiological, cognitive, and emotional responses to production pacing and arousing content as college-age students. This leads to the following research question:\\nRQ 1: Are there differences between tween and college-age populations on any of the dependent variables in this experiment?\\nTo test these hypotheses and answer the research question, participants will listen to 24 radio PSAs that vary in terms of production pacing and arousing content.\\nStudy Design\\nThe design of the experiment is a mixed Arousing Content (2) X Production Pacing (3) X Message (4) X Order of Presentation (4) design. Arousing Content, Production Pacing, and Message are within-subjects factors, and Order of Presentation is a between-subjects factor. Two levels of arousing content (calm and arousing) and three levels of pacing (slow, medium, and fast) are fully crossed resulting in six categories (calm-slow, calm-medium, calm-fast, arousing-slow, arousing-medium, and arousing-fast). There are four messages for each category, resulting in a total of 24 messages. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the four counterbalanced orders.\\nStimulus Materials\\nPacing. Three levels of pacing (slow, medium, and fast) were identified for this study. Pacing was operationalized as the number of structural onsets (i.e. voice changes, change from voice to a sound effect) in the message (Potter, 2000). Slow messages have 0 \\x96 3 structural onsets, medium messages have 8 \\x96 14 structural onsets, and fast messages have 21 -38 structural onsets. An ANOVA confirmed the manipulation was significant.\\nArousing content. Arousing content has two levels (calm and arousing). To categorize messages as calm or arousing, all of the PSAs being considered for inclusion in the study were pre-tested in two sessions with two different tape orders. The messages were shown to undergraduate students in communications courses who rated their emotional responses using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM), a pictorial scale used to assess emotional response along the three dimensions of valance, arousal, and dominance (Lang & Greenwald, 1985). From these ratings, five arousing messages and five calm messages within each production-pacing level were chosen for inclusion in the study.\\nDependent Variables\\nArousal. Listener arousal will be measured in two ways. Self-reported arousal will be measured using SAM. For this study only the valence and arousal dimensions will be measured. Physiological arousal will be assessed by measuring subjects= skin conductance responses.\\nAttentional Effort. Controlled attention will be measured using heart rate.\\nEncoding. Recognition will be used to assess encoding and will be measured using a forced-choice, four-alternative, multiple choice test. There will be four questions per message.\\nProcess\\nNinety undergraduate students enrolled in communication courses at a large Mid-western university are participating in experiment one October - December of 2002. Ninety tweens from schools in a Mid-western town will participate in experiment two in January - March of 2003.\\nEach subject will complete the experiment protocol individually. After giving informed consent (experiment one) or parental consent and informed assent (experiment two), subjects will be seated in a comfortable chair and sensors for measuring heart rate and skin conductance will be attached to the forearms and non-dominant hand. Subjects will then listen to the 24 national broadcast quality radio PSAs. When each PSA ends, subjects will rate how they felt while listening to the PSA using the SAM scale. Heart rate and skin conductance data will be collected while subjects listen to the announcements. After listening to all 24 PSAs, the sensors will be removed and subjects will complete a distractor task. After completing the distractor task, subjects will move to an adjoining room where they will be seated at a computer to complete the recognition test. They will also complete a sensation seeking questionnaire and respond to questions about their use or likely use (for tweens) of tobacco, alcohol, and/or marijuana.\\nResults from this study will add to knowledge about the effects of production pacing and arousing content in radio messages. It will also increase understanding of how tweens process media. This will help media producers be more effective in designing and creating radio PSAs that elicit attention, convey knowledge, alter attitudes, and perhaps change tweens= intentions to perform risky behaviors.\\n\\nReferences\\nCacioppo, J.

Particularly, this study focused more on what web tools were used, what emotional content was chosen, and what propaganda techniques were applied to disseminate hackers¡¯ messages in more effective ways.\\nThe findings suggest that politically motivated hackers preferred graphic, text, and e-mail to spread their messages. They frequently used visual content (gruesome photos, national flags, and logos) and verbal content (profane languages, verbal insults, slogans, and statistics) against opponents. The most popular propaganda technique used by politically motivated hacker groups was name-calling. The usage of web tools, emotional content, and propaganda techniques was different among pro-Israel, pro-Arab, pro-China and pro-U.S. hacker groups.',\n",

It argues that the production of rights occurs in the realm of social relations, which have cultural, economic and political dimensions. The creation of rights is often precipitated by mass movements that are animated by an ideology, as was the role of liberalism in the transition from feudal absolutism. Once rights have been erected, they become the basis in turn for animating the struggles of other groups from whom those rights are excluded.',\n",

The author argues that the rising survey industry in China, which has infiltrated by both the state and the market, is actually swallowing the \\x93public.\\x94 The survey practices in the 1980s can be characterized as state-sponsored. Most of the opinion polls were engineered by the Party-state to justify their reform policies by referring to \\x93public opinion\\x94 and to mobilize the public consent for further reforms. The concept of \\x93public\\x94 was thus formed only in terms of state-related. Moreover, since most of the surveys during this period were limited to the sample of the urban intellectuals, the \\x93public opinion\\x94 represented by the polling became elitist in essence, which sacrificed the principle of universal and equal access for the general public. Since the 1990s, survey research has become a booming industry in China\\x92s market economy. However, the \\x93public\\x94 represented in the surveys are still partial and incomplete. The development of the market economy in the 1990s led to the formation of a specific stratum of the urban middle-class, which now occupies a central position within the \\x93public.\\x94 Most rural Chinese are excluded from the \\x93public opinion\\x94 since the marketing research does not reach those rural regions.

       "  'abstract': \"America's pluralistic society is growing increasingly diverse as groups compete for media representation. Bombarded by a sea of images, many people fail to see their images reflected in the media. Although this is often articulated in terms of minority groups, the issue can be generalized to multiple sources of identity and meaning in people's lives. People see themselves as individuals but also as men or women, members of generations, of ethnic groups, of organizations and various other social roles through which people enact their goals and values. This paper focuses on people's perceptions of how they are portrayed in the media as well as the issue of media influence on the values portrayed. A survey in a major Midwest metro area measured perceived importance of values and their portrayal in the media, finding TV viewing correlated with perceived media representativeness of oneself as an individual and TV news viewing associated with perception of one's ethnic group. Perceived importance of values also is correlated with perceptions of their portrayal. Several dimensions of values recognized in the media are linked to people's perceptions that the media portray people like them, their generation, and their ethnic group. Regression analyses controlling for social categories in predicting people's perceptions that the media portray people like them, their generation and their ethnic group shows that actual media use is relatively unimportant, while dimensions of values assessed for importance and the patterns of values recognized in the media are significant predictors.\",\n",

The study surveyed 155 public relations educators and practitioners to determine their impressions on factors such as whether students are being imparted the knowledge and experience that is necessary for them to become public relations practitioners, the knowledge and skills respondents thought were critical for students to become successful professionals, the skills they felt new graduates needed to have, and what they considered to be the characteristics or criteria of the public relations profession. Results revealed that the first step appears to have been accomplished with agreement among public relations educators and practitioners about the importance of subjects that should be taught to college public relations students, and more importantly, the knowledge, skills and courses recommended by the Commission for Public Relations Education. While not all respondents agreed about the best career plan for future public relations professionals, a majority of respondents felt that majoring in public relations was the best thing for students who want to work in public relations. Because not all of the subjects that were perceived to be important by the respondents were also taught as much as they should be, it appears that some subjects need to be taught more.

Similarity, relevance, valence, and subjective norm mediate these effects in the comparison phase. Identification and empathy are seen as two instances of various parallel involvement and distance conflicts. A 2*2*2 between-subjects experiment indicated that the PEFiC-model best fitted the data with unipolarity of factors. The PEFiC-model outperformed traditional theories in explaining, for example, that bad characters were judged highly dissimilar to oneself, evoked more distance than involvement, and yet aroused positive appreciation. Furthermore, the effects of mediated bad persons differed strongly from ethically good ones.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'This study examines the media, public, and policy agendas in five countries relative to the Israeli/Palestinian dispute for periods as long as a quarter century. The media agenda was measured in the Associated Press (AP) for the United States, Agence France Presse (AFP) for France, Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) for Germany, TASS/ITAR-TASS (TASS) for the Soviet Union/Russia, and the Xinhua New Agency for China. The full texts from all these news wires archived in the LexisNexis electronic database were searched for quotes by Israelis and Palestinians, using the InfoTrend computer program. The quotes were also scored for the side quoted first in the story. The public agenda in the United States was an assessment of American public sympathy towards Israelis and Palestinians in surveys from the POLL database of the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut. The American policy agenda of interest in Middle Eastern issues was explored by examining surveys asking about Palestinians compared those concerned with Arab nations. The most striking feature of the three types of the American agendas was lack of abrupt changes in any of them throughout the 25 years of the study. All shifts were so gradual that even cataclysmic events such as wars and the September 11 terrorist attacks did not lead to agenda shifts that were obvious by inspection of the time trends. Therefore, parties to the Middle Eastern dispute might not be able to count on a single event to lead to their allies to push effectively for a resolution to the conflict. Turning to other countries, all their news agencies showed a decrease in favorability toward the Israelis in 2002. These trends imply the impact of several factors, including the target audiences and the political environment of the media studied.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'This paper interrogates the spatial and iconic ways that landscape in Southern California is used inscribe, naturalize, and exploit a profitable racial caste system in San Diego County?the very border region that the ICA has chosen as its theme in 2003.\\n\\nThis project summarizes five years (1995-2000) of field work and media work by the author among migrant farm-workers?primarily indigenous Mixtecs from Oaxaca and Mayans from Guatemala--in northern San Diego county. Utilizing clips from the award-winning documentary Rancho California (por favor), the paper challenges two fundamental myths. The first is a mythology of commerce and public relations. California promotes its intensive agriculture as breadbasket for the nation and as a key to consumer utopia. Few realize, however, that California intensively tills and farms, not simply crops, but human labor as well. In the post-NAFTA age of globalization,?raced-labor? is, arguably, one of the state?s most important economic products. Rancho California (por favor) document several of the hundreds of farm labor camps that exist in Southern California suburbs; camps that are always slightly, and conveniently, out-of-view. In some cases, scores of families live in makeshift shacks within a few hundred feet of the gated communities that employ them in Carlsbad, La Costa, and Del Mar. In other cases several hundred indigenous Oaxacan boys live and work invisibly in vast produce farms near Fallbrook and Escondido. Rancho California (por favor) documents the organization of these camps; their functions; and the meticulous ways that this human product is cultivated by managed deprivation on the margins. Far from the high-tech start-ups, race-labor has always been California?s most central ?synergy.?\\n\\nThis paper and visual presentation also questions a second set of favored academic mythologies. A slate of easy truisms characterize documentary theories of the past 15 years, such as: the problematic representation of the ?other?; the stylizing and constructed nature of documentary ?actuality?; the problem of speaking with any voice voice that is not, in some ways, also autobiographical of reflexive. These celebrated postmodern notions in documentary emanate from models of post-structuralism that have spurred an even more extensive (but no less problematic) orthodoxy in media critical studies: of semiotic openness; of textual rather than political oppositionality; of reception as an unstable shifting and defined by a mulitiplicity of reading positions. And while visible evidence from the arroyos in Rancho California (por favor) demonstrates how power works through public constructions, it does not leave one much confidence in academic notions of multiplicity and openness. The ?signs? of power in this raced landscape, that is, are also literal containers for worker bodies. These ?texts? are also chain-linked barriers for families. The creative, ?counter-practices? of these California campesinos, are also acknowledged parts of many local economies. They are, however, seldom recognized on the ground as acts of symbolic resistance.\\n\\nTying the immigrant/race-issue to specific, explosive political initiatives?like prop 187, prop 209?that erupt and fade from the headlines, risks ignoring the long, economically productive (but apparently invisible) daily ?habits? of California?s racial formation. Rather than looking at landscape as a place where racism happens, this paper shows how landscape?as enacted by zoning commissions, community associations, and corporations, and as fenced by growers?is also the means by which racism is ?performed? and in some cases, celebrated. ?Performativity,? far from being limited to subject sexuality positions in the way that Judith Butler describes, also characterizes a contested social space that is dramatically physical rather than abstract.\\n\\nII.

This article argues that private media participation has led to the use of Akan forms of representation to facilitate communication, through the articulation of national issues among an ethnically diverse group of people in Accra. It discusses how traditional Akan forms of representations have assumed national significance as a result of new forms of programming and representations. It posits that this dynamic in representation is the result of a media practice evolved through programming, which reflect authentic Ghanaian cultural identity. Akan has risen as a main language on some radio stations in Accra, because of the emergence of a hybrid cultural phenomenon which allows the use of an ethnic language for communications across an ethnically divers population.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper describes the political process of implementing the National Recovery Administration (NRA) codes in U.S. broadcasting from January 1933 to May 1935, when NRA legislation was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Through this first New Deal period, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) sought to maintain its corporate dominance of broadcasting that it won in the the Radio Act of 1927, and later the Communications Act of 1934. The largest U.S. radio networks (the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System) through its control of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), largely steered the NRA code-making process. The NAB Board of Directors developed a set of \"war plans\\' to protect advertisers, agencies, broadcasters, alike from attacks by unfriendly groups. The NAB\\'s principal focus was to protect the advertiser-supported broadcasting system from opposition groups. Though this organization, national broadcasting industry interests usually won out over the concerns of local or small-town broadcasters. Due to a largely cooperative policy that favored President Roosevelt, the radio industry maintained industry control through 1935 over the broadcasting status-quo despite challenges from organized labor groups such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and other organizations that had protested the almost complete commercial re-orientation of the industry. The following key turning points through the 1933-35 period: (1) organization of the Radio Broadcasting Code Authority (RBCA); (2) the establishment of network company unions to thwart independent unionism; (3) announcement of \"Code of Fair Competition for Radio Broadcasting\".',\n",

Because electronic mail seems to contribute greatly to the expanding volumes of information organizational members receive, and consequently, to the ensuring pressures to process the information, this study used electronic mail to explore the way in which organizational members process information.

       "  'abstract': 'Results of past research on physician-patient interruption present an inconclusive picture. This study re-conceptualizes interruption into co-operative and intrusive categories. Thirty physician-patient interviews, 13 male/male and 17 male/female, were audio-taped and micro-analyzed. It was found that physicians did not interrupt patients more or vice versa. Rather, physicians and patients interrupted differently, the former more intrusively and the latter, more co-operatively. Furthermore, physicians did not dominate speaking turns nor speak more words than patients, as previously believed. We argue that their difference may not be measured by the number of words or speaking turns because it is imbedded in their respective communication style. It was also found that female patients exhibited eleven times as much co-operative interruptions as did male patients. When physicians interrupted patients, they were unsuccessful only 61f the time. When patients interrupted physicians, they were unsuccessful 321003410535f the time. This pattern points out a novel challenge for training--teaching patients the skill of interrupting physicians successfully.',\n",

It was based on the British public service model. When The Bahamas dismantled colonization with independence from Britain in 1973, the broadcasting system retained the structure that was left by the British. From its inception broadcasting was state-owned, a condition that remained in effect until 1993. Throughout its seventy-two years of history, broadcasting in The Bahamas has faced numerous changes and challenges. Today, perhaps its greatest challenge is staying economically viable and aesthetically appealing to local audiences.

In this paper we will argue that a feasible managerial concept of public relations needs more indicators than relationships alone to reflect the plural nature of its service to organizations and society, and that this needs to be an empirically based concept. We, therefore, will propose a two-by-two-dimensional definition of organization and communication and derive four basic models of communication management from it. We will propose different indicators for each of the four models. Then we will argue that the four models are not exclusive, but complementary, and that organizations are best advised to use these simultaneously in various combinations, i.e., as strategies. We will argue that this is necessary because all models are positioned at the behavioral level, i.e., on (members of) organizations and their publics. Taken individually, the societal level remains totally neglected. We will argue that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the legitimacy problem of organizations. To address this we will propose a new view of practical public relations called reflective communication management that is derived from social sciences rather than behavioral sciences. In this view of communication management the four existing models are combined as strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With a worldwide trend of regulatory reform through liberalization, the goal of universal service might be threatened because the trend would undermine the cross-subsidy arrangements that have underpinned universal service. The choice among the different financing methods is a fundamental policy issue and is likely to be different in each country, given its own conditions and needs. Furthermore, the role of government and the regulator will vary with the particular method of funding that is chosen. In this context, this study tries to compare the implementation of universal service in the US and Japan focusing on the framework of Levy and Spiller (1996), which emphasizes the importance of institutional structure in policy-making processes. The study uncovers that the decentralized regulatory process and formalized regulation in the US are largely rooted in its institutional governance and have facilitated pro-competitive implementation in universal service. By contrast, in Japan strategic implementation has been possible through a more discretionary institutional system and the strong regulatory incentives for market-conforming intervention.',\n",

Its research aim is to know the relationship between TV consumption, viewers? favourite programmes, the electronic equipment that they have at home and the influence of these factors on the consumption of Pay-per-view (PPV) which started in Spain at the same time as digital TV, in 1997. The first important conclusion is that people who contract PPV services are great consumers of television and watch 218 minutes of TV per day; 5 minutes more than those who only receive general television stations, and 23 minutes more than those who have digital TV, but who do not contract PPV. The second conclusion is that there is no relation between computer technology (ownership of PC and consumption) and the contracting of PPV services. On the hand, contracting PPV is associated with the ownership of more modern TV equipment (screen 16/9, dual/stereo, VCR and videogame console) and audio equipment (Hi-Fi music centre). Thirdly, monthly household spending on PPV is also related to the possession of technological equipment. People who have a 16/9 TV set, or a dual/stereo TV set or teletext, spend more money than people who do not have them. On the other hand, people who do not have a PC, or a link to Internet, do not use e-mail and do not have a VCR spend more money monthly on PPV than people who do have this equipment and do use these services.',\n",

The associational effects of religion are limited, especially in comparison to the positive effects of political interactions that occur in non-church based settings. Moreover, our findings indicate that the cognitive dimension of religion fosters a retreat from certain types of communication behaviors, contributing to several negative effects on political efficacy, political trust, and social trust. Our study also confirms fears that the growing evangelical church movement may be doing damage to social capital, as evangelical Protestants are less knowledgeable of politics, less politically efficacious, and less trusting of others, after all controls.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Title:\\nRe-making of Popular Memory\\nthrough Historical Documentary Series:\\nAnalysis of of KBS\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThis paper suggests that the ideology of \\'modernity\\' and \\'development\\' is an important aspect of the historical documentary films in Korea, and further attempts to identify the distinctive characteristics of this particular form of visual representation. In developing the idea that the historical documentary films in Korea can be understood in terms of their capability of enabling the ideological reproduction to emerge and work within this form of visual representation, this presentation suggests that the documentary films can be seen to have its own mode of representation, as well as its own structure of narratives.\\n\\nThroughout the analysis both of the structure within the narrative and representational style, and of its changing relationship with the economic, political and social spheres, the paradoxical links between cultural practices and power relations can most usefully be explained. A number of different ways of looking at the documentary films are identified with this end in mind, including investigating the history and the definition which the documentaries have made, their own unique means of production, the relations of political and commercial forces within them, and their changing modes of representation.\\n\\nIn particular, this paper focuses on the way how the historical documentary films in Korea perform an important function of \\'legislating\\', or \\'constructing\\', and \\'interpreting\\' the concepts of \\'modernity\\' and \\'development\\' embodying the nation\\'s history, and also the way how the films efficiently mobilize the strategic modes of narratives and representation, so as to fulfill the designated ideological purposes. The modes of representation in particular allows us to consider the field of forces as unstable, and to consider the shifting nature of the relationship between visual production of documentary films and its reception from one historical period to the next.\\n\\nThe presentation suggests that while there are definite limits of a commercial, political and social kind placed upon cultural production of this particular visual form, the mobility of cultural objects made possible by the means of visual communication undermines, to some extent at least, the effectiveness of these restraints and underpins the specificities of the ideology of modernity and development dominating modern cultural life of our own.\\n\\nThis presentation assumes that documentary film is a vehicle for exposition, and is a more expansive form of representation than news, able to develop the values of duration, to stay with upholding action for several minutes, and to carry out an intensive filming of its topic followed by considered and lengthy phases of editing. Between the two poles of full theatricality and observationalism, documentary films have a whole range of options narrativizing its materials, both across the film or program as a whole or locally, within the terms of a specific scene. Given that documentary films do have a level of narrative structure, variously repressed or projected, this presentation would ask how the narrative actually works in this film or program, and with what aesthetic and cognitive consequences for the viewer.\\n\\n\"Imagined Modernity\" in Official Documentary Films\\n\\nHistorical documentary is frequently a vehicle for exposition of the ideology of modernity and development. By employing the strategies of their own narratives and representational styles, the television official documentary films play a role of legislating and interpreting the nation\\'s history. This study, however, does not particularly concentrate on the ideology of \\'modernity\\' established by the nation\\'s official documentary films, but more specifically on the ideology of \\'imagined modernity\\' through and in which the Korean\\'s own identity is formulated.\\n\\n\\nThe \"imagined modernity\" in this presentation is \\'the modernity in mental map, manipulatively designated and operated by the media performance. The issue of \"imagined modernity\" raises the question of the nature of social challenge posed for the ethical project of social theory by modernity. Whatever the arguments about its genesis and its implications, we broadly agree that the transition to \\'modernity\\' involved:\\n(a) an increased specialization or division of social labor in all social spheres, not just the economic - although economic specialization may have made other forms possible;\\n(b) the development of generalized structures of social co-ordination;\\n(c) what is sometimes called secularization but is more accurately described as the rise to dominance of a culture of critical rationalism and its associated scientific world view and the accompanying decline of doxa of tradition, especially the religious world view.\\n\\nThe problems raised for the Enlightenment project were the followings:\\n(a) first is concerning the question of how to build and rebuild the \"imagined community\";\\n(b) second problem is the question of structure and agency, and the dialectical relationship between social specialization and complexity, and the necessary accompanying growth in structurally constraining systems of general social co-ordination.\\n(c) the third problem is the relationship between the rational moral subject as individual consciousness and self-identity and the subject as socially formed.\\n\\nThis exposition is mostly grounded in to-camera and voice-over speech. And, the combination of presenter speech and images is often interspersed with the accessed voices of interviewees. Since many documentaries are concerned with the character and causality of other than physical events, their visualizations regularly need the support of speech, whether offered directly by a presenter or indirectly by those portrayed. Yet documentary is a more expansive form of representation than news, able to develop values of duration, to stay with unfolding action for several minutes, and to carry out intensive filming of its topic followed by considered and lengthy phases of editing.\\n\\nThe communication researches in the past largely rest upon an ideology as to the historical development of social provisions and their relationship to the development of modernity, and its characteristic structures and practices. They are narratives that make action and critique both possible and necessary. The form of history and the kinds of stories we construct and mobilize will depend upon both the question we are asking in the present and how that question has been framed historically. Such histories must be subject to validation both in the light of historical evidence and in the context of a rational discursive sphere of criticism.\\n\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe aim of this study is to analyze the social origins of certain historically specific forms of \"modernity\" shown in official television documentaries in Korea, (\"The Visual Diary\" in English, an official television documentary series, edited and produced, and broadcasted by a public broadcasting institution in Korea. The official documentaries themselves are \"the systems of identity formation\" funded and supervised by the nation\\'s broadcast institutions which provide a universal broadcast service for all the audience groups in the nation. A set of broadcast institutions constitutes a national system when it supplies the majority of the nation\\'s needs in information, and did so through an integrated and coordinated network of institutions. Such systems in Korea were consolidated since the 1960s, and they represented the precursors of modern state broadcasting.\\n\\nThrough analyzing the representational modes of the recent official documentary series, this study suggests that an oscillation of identification have continuously worked since the inception of the western modernity. Hence, the fixed ideal of unitary and coherent identity forced by official documentary films is in some senses invalid at least for the audiences who have passed through radical ruptures in history and experienced the vicissitudes of fate. The visual representation of history in the form of official documentary films presented the ideological foundation for the nation\\'s total structure of governance by influencing the viewers\\' popular memory, but also reminded the historical wound of \\'imagined modernity\\'.\\n\\nThemes, key narratives, and codes for representation\\n(The Visual Diary - 1948, KBS)\\nThemes Key narratives Styles of representation(OF: official, UOF: unofficial)\\n1. education expectations for new (western)educational system UOF / LS(pupils) / fast cw / light & amicable atmosphere (schools; roads)\\n2.

Thus, the collective experience presents the ideological foundation for the nation\\'s total structure of governance.\\n\\nNot only by employing the both the quantitative and qualitative research methods to analyze the narrative structure, but by utilizing in-depth interviews with documentary viewers, this study analyzes the both thematic and aesthetic codes of one episode (1948 - Nation-building) of the documentary series. Through the research, the study reveals how the both aesthetic and thematic codes construct a coherent mythological narrative about the shape of modernity in Korean history. The study finds that the mythological narrative about the \\'imagined modernity\\' is established, through a series of codes for visual representation, largely characterized by following three important themes.\\n\\n(1) The Nation-State\\nThe first theme is towards the construction of modern \"nation-state\", achieved in each clip more precisely by:\\n¨ç de-colonialism (Independence) (#4, #6; #7, #10, #11, #12, #13, #17);\\n¨è anti-communism (#4, #5, #14, #15, #16);\\n¨é economic development (#8, #12).\\n\\n(2) Westernization\\nThe second theme is towards the \"westernization\", which may include the concepts of:\\n¨ç Americanization (#8, #11);\\n¨è internationalization (#2, #10);\\n¨é western civilization (#1, #2, #11, #17).\\n\\n(3) Humanism\\nAnd, the final theme is towards the \"humanism\", which has sub-categories of:\\n¨ç freedom (#3, #4, #5, #8, #10, #15, #17);\\n¨è democracy (#3, #4, #6, #7, #12, #13);\\n¨é the quality of life (#8, #9, #10).\\n\\nThe study implies that the mythological narrative about the modernity represented in documentaries intends to serve a specific need for ideological control over the society. The visual representation of history through the documentaries exerts the political influences over the audience\\'s popular memories.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\nAllen R. C. (ed.)

In total, 2,315 speaking characters were assessed. The goal of the study was twofold. While updating the literature on the depictions of women in television commercials, this examination additionally aimed to provide insight into the quality and frequency of these characterizations across all age ranges. Findings suggest that males continue to outnumber their female counterparts, with the quality and diversity of these roles favoring males. Moreover, girls and senior age women tend to fare worst in terms of traditional stereotyping.',\n",

It especially investigates these images\\x92 denial of voice, and their universalizing abnegation of the ambivalent, borderland position of many Muslim women both in the diaspora and in countries such as Iran caught between Western and Islamic values. Arguing that the image of the silent and silenced veiled woman has been used to derogate Islam as a pre-modern and barbaric religion, it also acknowledges the possibility of desire and fantasy evoked by this figure in Western eyes. Through an examination of instances when veiled Muslim women have, exceptionally, been granted speaking rights in media representations, the paper examines the complexity and ambivalence of the border territory that is denied expression in the dominant visual trope.',\n",

It examines how these strategies extend or diminish the dialog between interviewer and respondent and how they contribute to the process and outcomes of the qualitative interview. It explores the nature of the qualitative interview as compared to the therapeutic encounter and considers the similarities and differences of the two processes. The therapeutic techniques included for analysis within this paper are empathy, reflective listening, focusing, and therapist self-disclosure. The text provides examples that analyze the applications and outcomes of these therapeutic techniques and presents extended portions of the individual interviews as a means of identifying the therapeutic strategies embedded in the dialog.\\nThe paper will initially provide a general description of the qualitative interview and the therapeutic encounter. These descriptions will orient the reader to the nature of these processes and identify the basic strategies and goals of each methodology. These discrete, yet similar events provide a foundational framework for this project and offer a point of reference for other, more detailed analyses that demonstrate a blending of the two. A broad definition of discourse and discussion of discourse analysis will provide a brief overview of the strategies employed for this exploration and clarify the emphasis on interview process rather than interview content.',\n",

This analysis holds that specific motivation and context must be considered in order to advance such a claim, especially in light of undercurrents of misogyny contributing to such phenomena as \"slash\" fan fiction authored by women and dealing with romances between male heroes. With this in mind, the study assesses the practices of female fans as well as relevant text and production factors in the context of particular, gender-related issues surrounding the series \"Farscape\" and \"Stargate SG-1,\" and finds that activities designated as emancipatory can, in fact, reproduce hegemony, and that fans sometimes appropriate resistive rhetoric in defense of hegemonic proclivities.',\n",

By analyzing a distinctive university BBS youth culture, the author intends to answer how is the resistance of a youth culture possible when it occurs in a fast changing society like China. Data presented in this article were based on face-to-face in-depth interviews with fifteen student BBS users from four Chinese universities. Discourse analysis is used in analyzing the data. Conclusions are as follows: first, new technology, such as the BBS, empowers the students to constitute their own BBS language style and to resist the real contexts they live in; second, resistance can only be observed if it is placed in a specific contextual and historical moment; and third, as to the case of the BBS youth culture in China, contradiction between the real trends of the society and the governmental and intellectual discourses produces subject positions for the youth to resist the orthodox ideas and traditional values; that is, the resistance of this youth culture is intimately related to their immediate living contexts.',\n",

We retest a model that suggests that primary antecedents, such as perceived news accuracy and perceived financial aspects of journalism, affect attitude toward newspaper (AN), which then affects newspaper readership. In retesting the model via structural equation modeling and partial correlations, we find that the process appears to differ by newspaper and newspaper community. With data from a 2000 telephone survey of a large Northern urban center, we find support for the model in terms of readership of one of the two focal newspapers.',\n",

Prior research found that the avoidance group expressed more healthy intentions than the other three groups. Researchers hypothesized that this unexpected finding was due to participants\\x92 prior knowledge about their low-risk status, which caused them not to believe the high-risk diagnosis they received.

       "  'abstract': 'A survey study of 471 teenagers in South Africa was conducted to explore the impact of the U. S. culture on the development of local adolescents. Adopting theoretical ideas from uses and gratifications research tradition, it was hypothesized that repeated, and more frequent, use of foreign media programs would lead to a positive attitude towards foreign products and ideas. The rationale was that the performance expectations built upon repeated use would lead to a point in which the individual\\x92s choice to gratify specific needs is no longer driven primarily by content-specific evaluation but by general expectations of the medium performance that are related to important audience needs and values.\\nThe results showed a significant relationship between the exploration of one\\x92s own cultural heritage and the advancement of autonomy and socialization tasks through media use. Furthermore, the use of television\\x97which in South Africa is dominated by U.S.-produced programs\\x97was positively associated with the spread of a global image that is represented by the U.S. culture. Suggestions on how to improve the measures and the theoretical model for future studies are also presented.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"Scanning television programs with the aid of a remote control device to find a suitable viewing option has become a widespread selective strategy among television viewers (Heeter & Greenberg, 1988; Walker & Bellamy, 1991; Walker, Bellamy & Traudt, 1993). Although correlates like age, gender, education, channel repertoire or sensation seeking (Wenner & Dennehy, 1993; Heeter, 1988) are well known, the explanation of this particular choice behavior remains quite unclear: Why do viewers choose a certain program after a period of scanning? What makes this question especially interesting is that rapid-fire scanning does not leave very much time for the decision: Within a few seconds viewers have to decide whether an option is suitable for watching or not. So it is not very probable that viewers base their judgements on complex information of the television stimulus like the plausibility or the appeal of the narration. Rather, it stands to reason that time is too scarce for systematic and well-founded judgements and that viewers go by peripheral cues - features of the message that are easy to process and that can influence judgements considerably if there is no time, ability or opportunity to process a stimulus more intensively. This reflects the position of dual-process-theories in social cognition (e.g. Cacioppo & Petty, 1985, Petty & Wegener, 1999; Chen & Chaiken 1999) that assume two fundamental modes of judgement formation: One is the systematic or central mode where people try to extract the most truthful judgement out of a given stimulus constellation, and the other is the heuristic or peripheral mode where people try to save time and effort by using well-tried rules of thumb (Moskowitz et al., 1999). This basic idea of dual-process-theories is the foundation of the model and the empirical study to be presented. The model proposes that viewers constantly process information when scanning through programs; the judgments about the single options are based on the information they just perceived. The options are evaluated rather heuristically than systematically, as decisions are made very quickly, and moreover, are not very vital to the individual and can be revised anytime without monetary costs. In this situation, peripheral cues can stop the heuristic mode and initiate a more systematic evaluation. What becomes visible in television behavior is a longer pause at options that bear such peripheral cues. One type of cues seems especially relevant to this kind of process and has been subject to extensive research: Perceptually salient cues of the television message.\\nFormal features like pace, movement, visual effects, voices, sounds and music have been proven to evoke attention in viewers (especially orienting reflexes), and equally have content features like violence, erotic portrayals, humor and emotion been proven to have effects on attention and arousal .\\n\\nThus, when viewers are scanning through programs, an attentional shift or a rise in arousal can be provoked if they touch an option that is perceptually more salient than the previous ones. Furthermore, it is not only the mere amount of salient features that results in orienting reflexes, but also sudden changes in salient features (Eimer et al., 1996); so the amount of change from one option to the next should also have the potential to terminate heuristic processing (that is scanning). Terminologically, scanning periods are television intervals of short duration that serve as orientation; decision periods represent the first few moments of a chosen option that are equal in duration to the scanning intervals. Following these considerations, two hypotheses are be set up:\\n\\nHypothesis 1: The density of salient features in decision periods is higher than in scanning periods.\\nHypothesis 2: The change in salient features from the last scanning interval to the decision period is higher than the changes within the scanning period.\\n\\nEmpirical study. To test these hypotheses, a study combining content analysis and behavioral meter data was conducted. On the one hand, television program from the 15 largest German TV channels was recorded in summer of 1997 during one hour, covering prime time between 19:30 and 20:30 p.m. This program was content-analyzed for cuts, camera movement, movement of objects and people, visual effects, voices, sounds, music (formal features), violence, erotic portrayals, humor and emotion (content features). The coding recorded the status of all mentioned variables for every second of the hour. On the other hand, meter data from the continuous national German television measurement system were available for the same period of time. The meter data recorded all movements made by all persons in the panel on a second-to-second-basis. Thus, an exact time match between content data and behavioral data was possible. Only persons who were watching television alone were included in the analysis, as not to confuse individual with group behavior. All in all, data of 1746 viewers were used. Prior to actual analysis, behavioral data were analyzed in order to identify scanning and decision periods; from this analysis, 3052 clusters of scanning and decision emerged.\\n\\nData analysis. To test hypothesis 1, a comparison was made between the amount of salient features in the scanning period (mean value) and the amount of salient features in the decision period (see figure 1).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Rationale for data analysis in hypothesis 1 (example with cuts per minute)\\n\\nTo test hypothesis 2, a comparison was made between the amount of change in salient features in the scanning period and the amount of change in salient features from the last scanning interval to the decision period (see figure 2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Rationale for data analysis in hypothesis 2 (example with cuts per minute)\\n\\nHypotheses will be confirmed, if the value for salient features resp. the value for change in the decision period is greater than in the scanning period. To test the significance of the comparison, linear mixed models (Brown & Prescott 1999) were computed that take into account that viewers can perform several choices (repeated measurements).\\n\\nResults\\nHypothesis 1 can be partly confirmed: The values for camera movement, object movement, voices and sounds are consistently greater in decision periods than in scanning periods. On the other hand, visual effects, cuts and music could not yield that effect. As for content features, violence, humor and emotion but not erotic portrayals had higher values in decision periods. This means that most of the salient features have the predicted effect on television program choice: It is probable that viewers pause for a longer period of time if they come across a more salient television message.\\nHypothesis 2: Looking at changes in salient features, we can confirm an effect on selection for all features but humor and erotic portrayals. This means that the change from the last scanning interval to the decision period is more important than changes within the scanning period. Hence, viewers tend to stop their scanning when they meet an option that represents an unusually high contrast to the previous option.\\n\\nReferences\\nBrown, H. & Prescott, R. (1999).

Legal change appears as another significant influence and this paper focuses on defamation law and news production and considers how defamation law attempts to take news production practices into account. US and Australian cases have created, and continue to draw on, models of journalistic practice, which appear to be aimed at lessening any 'chilling effect' of defamation law on media speech. The authors argue for an interdisciplinary, comparative approach to understanding the different legal regimes and their effects within news production.

The traditional common pattern of statehood in the mediamatics sector is obsolete and a new common pattern seems to emerge, encompassing changes of political institutions, content and processes of regulation and control.

By considering the meaning of artistic agency in the production of global advertising, as well as by acknowledging the implications for media consumers and critics, this essay interprets integrated branding as a source of the \\x93contestation\\x94 described by Appadurai as the global imagination. The discussion is organized around an historical literature review of the century-long development of artists into graphic designers in the advertising industry, a theoretical framework based on concepts of globalization by Appadurai and Giddens, and a review of relevant critical theory. The BP campaign is analyzed in a semiotic analysis of past and present logos and their attendant meanings. Following this interpretive explication of the integrated branding process and its meaning, the study concludes that integrated branding represents a key obstacle for authenticity, agency and action in global communication.',\n",

After four months, both received and sent email messages were coded for relational maintenance strategies, self-presentation strategies, self-disclosure statements, complaints, seeking common ties, frequency of contact, and mutual desire to maintain friendships. Results showed no significant differences between intergenerational and intragenerational pairs in the agreement to stay email friends. After controlling for total messages sent, it was found that the number of self disclosure and self presentation strategies used by friendship partners were the most important differences in intergenerational and intragenerational friendship pairs and in those pairs that agreed to stay friends and those that did not. Regardless of age cohort, it was determined that in email friendships both partners should communicate often, find common ties, and engage in relational maintenance strategies.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Sex and Violence Makes Me Yawn: Autonomic Desensitization to Music Videos',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"The influence of sex and violence are one of the major concerns in music video research. Content analyses of music videos has found a high degree of videos containing sexual or violent content (Sherman & Dominick, 1986; Tapper, Thorson & Black, 1994). Further, it has been found that some genres like rap are more likely than other genres to contain sexual and violent content (Smith & Boyson, 2002).\\nOne effect of sex and violence that has been demonstrated is a desensitization effect. This effect refers to viewers who view a lot of violence or sex becoming less disturbed or aroused by it (Harris, 1999). Desensitization has primarily been demonstrated through attitudinal response. For example, Johnson, Jackson, and Gatto (1995) revealed that male adolescents who viewed violent rap music videos tended to more easily condone the use of violence as a means of social problem solving relative to their peers. Kalof (1995), demonstrated that viewing music videos that portrayed women in a sexually explicit nature led to greater acceptance of adversarial sexual beliefs. Further, Preston (2001) found that college students who viewed a lot of music videos perceived less sex and violence in music videos than students who very rarely viewed music videos. The purpose of this study is to examine whether desensitization to sex and violence in music videos is rooted in differential autonomic emotional reactions to the content on the part of heavy viewers compared to light viewers.\\nEmotional processing of media content during exposure could form the basis for latter evaluative reactions to media messages. Research in Cognitive Neuroscience has demonstrated that emotion gets associated with memories formed during exposure to information in the environment (Ledoux, 2000). A dulling of emotional reaction to information could lead to less strong emotions associated with information in memory which in turn could lead to the attitudinal responses found by researchers studying desensitization to sex and violence. A first step to testing this explanation of the desensitization effect for music videos is to examine whether there is dulling of emotional response during exposure brought on by frequent viewing of music videos. Therefore, this study will test the following hypotheses:\\nH1: Heavy viewers will be less aroused during exposure to violent music videos compared to light viewers.\\nH2: Heavy viewers will experience less negative emotion during exposure to violent music videos compared to light viewers.\\nH3: Heavy viewers will be less aroused during exposure to sexual music videos compared to light viewers.\\nH4: Heavy viewers will experience less positive emotion during exposure to sexual music videos compared to light viewers.\\nMethod\\nIndependent Variables\\nViolence\\nViolence was conceptualized as the visual presentation of an act of physical aggression against another human. Violence was manipulated by showing participants videos that had been rated during pre-testing as having a high degree of violence and videos that had been rated as having very little violence.\\nSex\\nSex was conceptualized as the visual presentation of real or simulated physical activities associated with human sex acts. Sex was manipulated by showing participants videos that had been rated during pre-testing as having a high degree of sex and videos that had been rated as having very little sex.\\nDependent Variables\\nArousal\\nArousal was conceptualized as a dimension of emotion pertaining to how excited or calm a person feels (Lang, Bradley, Greenwald & Hamm, 1993). Skin conductance was measured by assessing participants' skin conductance. Skin conductance was collected for a five second baseline period prior to each video and time-locked to exposure to the music videos.\\nEmotional Valence\\nEmotional valence was conceptualized as a dimension of emotion pertaining to how positive or negative a person feels (Lang, Bradley, Greenwald & Hamm, 1993). Emotional valence was measured using facial EMG. Specifically, facial muscle activity was measured in the Zygomatic (smile) and Corrugator (frown) muscles. Facial EMG data was collected for a five second baseline period prior to each video and time-locked to exposure to the music videos.\\nStimuli\\nMusic videos for this study were selected in a two stage process. First, the researchers selected 15 videos they believed were high in violence, high in sex and low in both sex and violence. The pool of videos were selected from the music video library of a campus cable television station. This station airs a locally produced weekly music video program so it receives music video service from all the major record labels. The 15 selected videos were pre-tested on 10 undergraduate students enrolled in a communication course. Pre-test participants rated the videos for how prevalent and explicit sex and violence was in each video. Ratings on prevalence and explicitness were collapsed to give each video a gross sex and violence score. Three videos that scored the highest on violence / low on sex, highest on sex / low on violence and lowest on both sex and violence were chosen as stimuli. The nine stimulus videos were edited into three random orders.\\nParticipants and Procedure\\nParticipants were 60 (30 heavy viewers, 30 light viewers) undergraduate students enrolled in a communication course at a large northwestern university. Prior to the experiment 125 students enrolled in the class completed a survey that measured how often they viewed music videos. Students who scored at the extremely high end of the scale (heavy viewers) and students who scored at the extremely low end of the scale (light viewers) were contacted and asked to participate in the experiment. Participants completed the study one at a time in a psychophysiology lab. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. Participants were prepped for the collection of physiological data and then given instructions for completing the self-report measures. Self-report measures of perceived sex and violence were obtained for a manipulation check and were asked to indicate if they had seen the video before to control for familiarity. Self-report measures also included attitude toward the video and the arousal and valence dimensions of the SAM scale. Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions and then were shown the videos. Participants completed self-report measures between each video and informed the researcher when they were ready for the next video. After completing self-report measures for the last video, participants were thanked and dismissed.\\n\\nReferences\\nHarris, (1999). A Cognitive Psychology of Mass Communication.

       "  'abstract': 'Shaping an International Issue: Analyzing U.S. Media Coverage about a \"War with Iraq\"\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nThis paper attempts to critically analyze the media coverage on a possible war with Iraq, proposed by US President George W. Bush in September 2002. To analyze the issue as an international issue, this paper first extensively reviews various salient characteristics of international issues, their media coverage, and public perception. They include the structural limitations of news gathering, various \\x93distances\\x94 or \\x93borderlands\\x94 emphasized or deemphasized in international news, and construction of social sentiment. Based on this review, the latter half of the paper quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes U.S. media coverage on the Iraq issue through three agenda-setting newspapers. The quantitative analysis reveals news stories\\x92 reliance on U.S. official sources, while relatively marginalizing Iraqi sources, although Iraq would be the most affected location concerned. The qualitative analysis shows how various \\x93distances\\x94 and \\x93human agencies\\x94 are discursively and linguistically emphasized or deemphasized; thus showing support for the U.S. position on the issue.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This case study analyzes the implementation and negotiation micropractices of a specific program of enterprise discourse, Stephen R. Covey\\x92s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Through the lens of discursively influenced identity, we focus on the intersection of discourse and organizational practice to explore what characteristics of the enterprise discourse make it so effective at shaping the identities of organization members. We illuminate key characteristics of the discourse of enterprise for identity shaping and organizational control by examining micropractices at SkyWatch, a high-tech, defense-oriented government facility in the western United States. SkyWatch members, in response to Congressional budget cuts, reorganized themselves into a more competitive, market-oriented organization. During this period of change, facility leaders turned to Covey\\x92s 7 Habits as a way of teaching \\x93trust\\x94 and \\x93character\\x94 to the members of the SkyWatch workforce. This case thus provides an excellent opportunity to assess the implementation of a specific program of the enterprise discourse and to see what makes this particular discourse successful at shaping organizational identities. Specifically, our findings indicate that Covey\\x92s change program shows the simultaneously general and specific nature of value-based identity discourses, blurs the boundaries between the internal and external organization, functions in multiple contexts, and takes on the character of a mandate.',\n",

Instead of simply describing the ability to read and write, nowadays literacy often refers to technological know-how. However, literacy might not be exactly what communication scholars ought to assess in the technological context. Instead, this research proposes to assess fluency or competency. Also, technological fluency or competency can no longer be limited to computers alone, but must be extended to other technologies, such as email, the web, instant messaging, etc. The research described tested an existing computer-mediated communication (CMC) competency instrument that might fill the existing research gap. Over three applications, the revised instrument proves to be reliable and valid. Also, the research shows that CMC competency is partially due to the medium itself, but partially also due to the context in which the medium is used by an individual and his/her personal criteria in relation to others, and/or the socially constructed reality and meaning in which any CMC interaction takes place.',\n",

Second, this paper looks specifically at the functions and purposes of the Sisterdjs listserv for its participants. Ultimately, I argue that the Sisterdjs listserv is an educating and encouraging space for its participants with no offline equivalent. My findings suggest that Sisterdjs is important to the identity construction of female DJs. Collectives such as this one provide support to women who are pursuing interests beyond the borders of their traditional gender roles. Such encouragement and reassurance works to break down beliefs in the necessity and naturalness of performing prescribed gender roles, both within and beyond the borders of E/DM communities.',\n",

By analyzing data from large-scale consumer surveys conducted in three most economically advanced cities, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, this study constructs two consumerist value indices, quality consumption, innovative consumption and attitude toward advertising. It finds that exposure to market-content on media, media advertisements and foreign movies each has a distinct contribution to fostering a more ready acceptance of the two consumerist values and a more positive attitude toward advertising. More detailed analysis shows that different socio-cultural milieu among the three cities play different but still significant roles in enhancing the consumerist values. Implications of the findings and directions for future studies are discussed.',\n",

Regardless of ethnic boundaries, a homogenous, monolithic Chineseness is imposed on every Chinese. In the process, ethnicity, though not totally effaced, can only be staged on the margin.

HPV is the fastest growing and second most-prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States. It has been identified as a primary cause of cervical cancer, a disease that kills 5,000 women in the United States. Mass media may be able to play an important role in fighting the disease because there is at present no cure and the disease is spread through sexual contact. However any media campaign must take into account the expertise and beliefs of university health professionals, since these individuals work at the \"front lines\" in protecting student health. Our findings suggested areas of broad consensus among these professionals, including beliefs in the high prevalence of the disease and the value of mass media for raising awareness and education. However there was little consensus about other issues of importance for message designers, such as the severity of the disease and the appropriate targets or objectives for message campaigns. A social marketing perspective is used to identify ways in which health messages can be developed that may assist the efforts of our respondents in fighting HPV and cancer.',\n",

PETERSBURG JOURNALISM:\\nbetween centre and periphery\\n\\n\\nThe paper describes the transformation of contemporary Russian journalism in the natural dichotomy of common trends initiated and set to a great extent from the centre of power in Moscow on the one hand, and specifics pertaining in the regions, on the other. As common trends characterising the post-Soviet society and media we note capitalization, westernization, commercialization and corruption. The specific character was formed by the political and economic conditions pertaining in St. Petersburg as one of 89 subjects of the Russian Federation from the end of the 1990s to the beginning the 2000s. The paper is based on the empirical study on the city media conducted 1998-2001 in St. Petersburg and presented as a licentiate's thesis in spring 2002 at the University of Tampere, Department of Journalism and Mass Communication. The data consists of pilot interviews with eleven experts in 1998, in-depth interviews with thirty journalists in the editorial offices of the eight basic media in 1999 and a survey of eleven experts in 2001. Posing the question how the common trends are converting into the local context the paper describes the forming of the conditions for journalism and its emerging characteristics. On the one hand, the study reveals crucial changes after the decade of reforms, such as the intensive development of informational and advertising services in society and commercialization of media and journalist's labour. On the other hand, the study notes the forces of continuity constituting the past because the media and journalists formerly served rather the interests of the political and economic groups than the interests of public.\",\n",

The two sets of coverage, however, differ substantially in the nature of that light. The Watergate coverage gives explicit voice to the metaphor of publicity as a searchlight, an apersonal and disembodied agent of surveillance which illuminates the political in a rational-institutional light. By contrast, the Clinton coverage is implicitly built around a metaphor of publicity as a floodlight, a dramaturgical exposure of the political process which celebrates instead an emotional, personal, and narrativistc frame for the political and a subjective, embodied approach to journalism.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Difficulties in the implementation of information system technologies\\nThis paper will explore questions highlighted by strikingly severe and similar problems organizations face in the implementation of information systems. Clegg, et al, (1998) suggest that up to 801f information system projects do not meet expectations. Similar experiences are reported across time, industry, organizational size and national or cultural boundaries (Clegg, et al, 1998; Martinsons and Chong, 1998; Hirschheim, 1985). Further, scholars reviewing the literature find not only a consistent pattern of disappointment regarding the intentions of those initiating projects, but a fair amount of agreement on basic explanations. Explanations for information system project failures are broadly characterized as \\x91social\\x92 rather then a technical kind (Bjorn-Anderson, 1986; Clegg, et al, 1998; Hirschheim, 1985). In other words, success turns on adaptation of organizational relationships rather then resolving technical glitches.\\nA key \\x91social\\x92 problem repeatedly pointed to in the literature is the failure of organizations to elicit adequate levels of motivation on the part of the full range of those implicated in the success of a project. Motivation is understood as a question of the willingness or motivation of organizational members to exercise skills and energy in reference to the formal stated objectives of a particular project, i.e., \\x91ownership\\x92 of or \\x91identification\\x92 with the project. Two sorts of motivation are differentiated. \\x91Compliance\\x92 is behavior in response to authoritative directives and regulated by the terms of the employment contract associated with efficacy of organizational functioning within established relationships. \\x91Commitment\\x92, on the other hand, is associated with organizational innovation and change in relationships. The overall argument made below is that information system implementation projects typically fail because they require some form of relational change undermined by deficits in \\x91commitment\\x92.\\nSocial influence and \\x91project leadership\\x92 factors in eliciting \\x91commitment\\x92\\nProcesses of eliciting greater individual \\x91commitment\\x92 - i.e., processes of mutual orientation in coordination of relational change - include \\x91participation\\x92 in the project and social influence processes that lead to support for the project. A key to the latter is \\x91project leadership\\x92 (Rost, 1998). \\x91Project leadership\\x92 in this sense is not \\x91leadership\\x92 typically understood in \\x91leadership\\x92 research \\x96 that associated with positions of formal authority (Bush, 1998). Instead, following the social psychology of John S. Turner (1987, 2001) and some leadership theorists (Rost, 1998), it is understood here as situational quality. Situational factors include patterns of mutual identity that form around particular cognitive contents. In other words, \\x91leadership\\x92 is a function of relational dispositions among sets of actors mutually identified or embedded in social processes of meaning formation, or mutual identification \\x96 a \\x91normative\\x92 group or \\x91cohesive\\x92 group. Rost (1998) \\x91leadership\\x92 with the ability to impact particular outcomes \\x96 relational change through coordination of new mutual visions, beliefs, habits and practices.\\n\\x91Participation\\x92 is a behavioral role in decision making regarding the project. \\x91Participation\\x92 lends a sense of \\x91ownership\\x92 and identification with the project leading to higher levels of \\x91commitment\\x92.\\nStructural parameters for project \\x91participation\\x92, \\x91project leadership\\x92 and \\x91commitment\\x92\\nA review of the literature draws one to two basic organizational structural elements with potential to explain why organizations tend to fail to elicit adequate \\x91project leadership\\x92, \\x91participation\\x92, and \\x91commitment\\x92 in projects. One is a particular form of authority relations \\x96 hierarchical, command-control structures. Organizational socio-structural factors are identified in grounding hypothesized determinants. One of these is the type of authority structure - centralized, command-control authority structures. These structures create \\x91social distance\\x92 undermining social influence processes and thus the potential support of \\x91project leaders\\x92. In addition, these authority structures have implications for the role of \\x91participation\\x92 in projects \\x96 limiting \\x91participation\\x92 in general, and locating those who \\x91participate\\x92 (and thus who are most likely to be \\x91project leaders\\x92) in structural locations at greatest \\x91social distance\\x92 from the majority of system users. Those most likely to be \\x91project leaders\\x92 due to overall organizational disposition and opportunity to \\x91participate\\x92 are thus structurally located at greatest social distance from the full range of those implicated in the success of a project. \\x91Social distance\\x92 in light of the heterophilious difference and conflict of interest between hierarchical levels is hypothesized as one foundation for failure of effective ability for \\x91project leadership\\x92.\\nTwo social influence infrastructures are identified based on relational ties in the organization, in turn tied to types of organizational outcomes. Organizational outcomes are differentiated into \\x91relational\\x92 and \\x91instrumental\\x92 and tied to social influence paths grounded in particular types of relational infrastructures in organizations. Thus, \\x91leadership\\x92 hierarchical ties are associated with \\x91relational\\x92 outcomes, and \\x91managerial\\x92 ties are associated with \\x91instrumental\\x92 outcomes. Deficits in \\x91leadership\\x92 relationships or social influence infrastructures are tied to command-control authority structures that tend to prefer \\x91managerial\\x92 relationships.\\nA second structural factor examined as a structural foundation understanding levels of \\x91commitment\\x92 towards a project is organizational politics. Organizational politics is understood as informal resources exchange networks within organizations \\x96 i.e., \\x91political coalitions\\x92 \\x96 that determine or channel organizational resources. Two sorts of key resources are examined regarding information system implementation: Training and participation in decision-making.\\nIn sum, two structural factors \\x96 centralized, command-control hierarchy and organizational politics \\x96 are examined as common factors that explain patterns of information system success and failure across organizations noted in reviews of the literature.\\nData and methods\\nData involves attitudinal measures as well as communication network measures before and after the implementation of two major information systems in service corporation in the 1990\\x92s. Using social network analysis concepts and techniques (Burkhardt and Brass, 1992), \\x91social proximity\\x92 to \\x91project leadership\\x92 will be modeled as social influence model explaining information project success. Goals are to specify and test constructs derived from speculative conclusions regarding the inhibition of information system success regarding organizational conflict and miss-management of resources due to hierarchical conflict and informal organizational politics. Further, this research develops social information processing theory by using social psychology theory to create and test new indices of \\x91normative\\x92 relational contexts for social influence.\\nBjorn-Andersen, N., Rasmussen, L.

       "  'abstract': 'Feminists have produced fundamental challenges to traditional politics around the world. However, the public communication of these issues remains a key challenge for feminism. In this essay I review recent case studies of feminist-news interactions from around the world, including an empirical study of my own, in order to identify some of the shared structures (and agencies) involved in these interactions. Feminist-news interactions are complex and multi-level and I argue that the contradictory mix of containment and publicity that feminism has experienced in the public sphere is the result of feminists\\x92 uneven success at negotiating different levels of this interaction. Feminists have generally been more successful at negotiating the economic or organizational structures of news \\x96 the structures of access \\x96 than they have been at countering the discursive rules of news \\x96 the structures of representation. Whether this impasse is permanent or negotiable is a critical question for feminist theory and practice.',\n",

As proposed by Martin (2002), three perspectives to cultural studies, namely, integration, differentiation, and fragmentation were used to review relevant literature. The second half of the paper provided a critique of current study on organizational culture in foreign subsidiaries of MNCs. It was suggested that most studies assumed cultural boundaries as fixed, isolated, and stable, which failed to reveal the complexities involved in today\\x92s multinational companies. As a result, we indicated various ways how Martin\\x92s subjective view of organizational culture as well as her nexus approach to cultural studies could be used to in studying organizational culture in binational or multinational work settings.

       "  'title': 'Surviving soccer fever: 2002 World Cup coverage and the (re)definition of Japanese cultural identity',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'In the early summer of 2002, Japan came down with a serious case of sokka feeva (soccer fever). Originating in this country\\x92s first ever co-hosting of the soccer world cup with neighboring Korea, the virus promptly spread through the entire nation. Soon, every aspect of Japanese popular culture, and even of the Japanese physical environment, was somehow inundated with soccer references ranging from huge posters and billboards to magazine covers to world cup comic books or hello kitty dolls. In the muggy days of June, residents of Japan\\x97and the thousands of tourists who poured over the nation\\x92s capital to attend the games hosted in the area\\x97wore blue soccer jerseys to the office, ate soccer cup noodles and drank soccer drinks, sang soccer songs at karaoke, used soccer graphics as their cellular phone screen savers and watched the games from home, bars, clubs, work or even the mall. All this in a country where barely ten years ago, the sport of soccer was virtually unheard of (Moffett, 2002).\\nThis paper examines the visual narratives constructed in Tokyo around this historical occasion on various Japanese popular cultural sites including advertising, public relations campaigns, magazine and other print media photographs, and television coverage. I was fortunate enough to watch these narratives unfold as I resided in Tokyo at the time the world cup took place. I am particularly interested here in addressing how Japan visually located itself in relationship to the rest of the world for both a Western audience of tourists and the domestic Japanese audience. I will also examine how Japan managed to turn this \\x93foreign\\x94 sporting event into a specifically Japanese\\x97or at least Asian\\x97cultural phenomenon, domesticating Western cultural influence in the process. I believe that Japanese officials\\x92 and media producers\\x92 handling of the event is significant because it is illustrative of the larger process through which Japan has forcefully claimed its place as a major player in the global capitalist world order in the past few decades.\\n\\nSports in a global environment\\nSports play a significant role in the construction of national and/or ethnic identities. Sundeed (2001) points, for instance, to the significance of Little League Baseball in promoting a new Taiwanese identity constructed in opposition to the People\\x92s Republic of China, even though the sport was originally introduced to help promote reunification. Boyle (2000) analyzes the central position soccer has taken in defining nationhood in the stateless nation of Scotland. As he puts it, \\x93At the national level, the Scottish international football team has at times been one of the few collective expressions of a Scottish national identity,\\x94 (p. 22). Others have noted similar patters in France (Carrard, 2002), East Germany (Magdalinski, 1999), Cameroon (Vidacs, 1999) or Argentina (Alabarces and RodrÌguez, 1999). By allowing fans to engage in highly publicized events deemed of national or international scope, competitions such as the Super Bowl, the World Cup or the Olympics contribute to the creation of the kind of imagined communities Benedict Anderson (1983) considers essential to the development of cultural and national identity.\\nThe types of sports deemed national or at least highly popular in a cultural environment are also reflective of the dominant values promoted in this particular culture at a particular point in time. This is certainly true in the case of Japan, where, at least until this summer, Baseball had been judged the perfect representative of the values of the corporate world, and, hence, the ideal national pastime (Horne, 1999). Japan\\x92s adoption of soccer, which started being consciously planned by political and business leaders about ten years ago, might thus reflect a shift in this country\\x92 internal value system from the highly hierarchical seniority-based cooperative ideal of the salariman to the more creative, youth-oriented, initiative-taking character of new entrepreneurs (Moffett, 2002).\\nBut the appearance of soccer on the Japanese popular cultural scene is not just important internally. As numerous scholars have noted, Japanese popular culture cannot be adequately understood outside the context of this country\\x92s long and complex relationship to the West (see for example, Ivy, 1993, 1995, 1989/1997; Hammond, 1987; Najita, 1989/1987). According to John Whittier Treat, \\x93the question of Japan\\x92s popular culture inevitably invites the questions of origins, sources, influences and colonialisms both long-standing and otherwise\\x94 (1996, p. 4). Indeed, as with many previous \\x93cultural importations\\x94 ranging from Japan\\x92s educational and media systems (Kato, 1978) to aspects of Judo or of the current Sumo championship system (Inoue, 1998; Thompson, 1998), soccer was consciously brought to Japan from Europe, only to be turned into a Japanese \\x93tradition\\x94 with, in particular, the establishment of the J-league. Foreign managers were hired to train Japanese teams and turn corporate league players concerned with cooperating with and differing to the authority of their elders into competitive risk-taking individuals (Moffett, 2002). Japan\\x92s selection as a host for the 2002 World Cup demonstrates this country\\x92s ultimate success in \\x93importing\\x94 the sport. The decision to so assertively do so may be indicative of a desire to reframe Japan\\x92s image both internally and globally. I believe this desire was illustrated in the omnipresent imagery surrounding the World Cup events that took place in Tokyo throughout the summer of 2002.\\nThe following analysis focuses on visual representations of soccer found in Tokyo and its surrounding areas as the World Cup was taking place. Because I strongly believe that Japanese popular cultural texts must be considered in the larger context in which they are distributed and consumed (Darling-Wolf, 2000a), I am not spotlighting one particular text, or type of text, but examining the ensemble of visuals omnipresent in the Japanese capital at the time as Tokyo residents or tourists might have experienced it. In order to do so, posters, billboards and street advertisements were photographed, materials referring to soccer\\x97from ads to magazine articles\\x97were collected, and television programs and commercials were taped during a seven-week period started in mid-May 2002, shortly before the Cub started, to early July, shortly after it ended. Of course, I cannot claim to have been able to collect all materials referring to the event available at the time. I believe, however, that I was able to gather a representative sample of the type of imagery Japanese soccer fans and foreign tourists were exposed to. A close examination of these materials revealed a number of \\x93cultural myths\\x94 (Barthes, 1972, p. 129) developing around the theme of the World Cup in photographs and other visuals displayed around Tokyo.\\n\\nJapan as part of the world\\nOne of the most obvious manifestations of sokka feeva in the early summer 2002 was the sudden proliferation of multiracial imagery in the Japanese media. While Western faces are certainly always present on the Japanese popular cultural scene (Darling-Wolf, 2000b; Creighton, 1995), the beginning of the world cup prompted an unprecedented explosion of \\x93united colors of soccer\\x94 imagery in the streets of Tokyo powerful enough to cause residents to walk around with personal renditions of the Disney theme park song \\x93It\\x92s a small world after all\\x94 running through their brains. Huge billboards advertising athletic shoes, sports drinks, or even cell phones featured soccer players of various ethnicities and nationalities united by the capitalist endeavor of venting the merits of these products to the Japanese audience. Japanese players were, of course, included in this diverse imagery, suggesting that Japan was \\x93one of the teams\\x94 not only on the soccer field but also in the capitalist world order.\\nThe most literal illustration of this phenomenon was, perhaps, the World Cup public relations campaign that ran in commuter trains until the Japanese team\\x92s elimination from the competition. The campaign was composed of series of small posters, similar to those found hanging from the ceiling of most Japanese public transportation, describing various high points in soccer World Cup history. One poster focused, for instance, on the French 1998 victory, another on the \\x93Maradona show\\x94 that brought Argentina its 1986 victory in Mexico, a third on Brazil\\x92s record-setting forth win in 1994 in the United Stated, all hanging next to each other. Written both in Japanese and English, the campaign seemed to be designed to appeal to foreign tourists as well as Japanese locals. The English language employed in the posters was, however, manipulated to closely resemble the grammatical structure of the Japanese language and consequently be easier for Japanese native speakers to comprehend. This use of \\x93Japoglish\\x94 is a common feature of Japanese advertising written in English to suggest an international flavor but targeted at a domestic audience.\\nIn case the Japanese audience did not feel included enough in the multiracial and multinational world of the campaign, the posters soon started boasting Japanese accomplishments. On the morning of June 15, the day after Japan beat Tunisia in its third World Cup game, several posters dated \\x93June 14, 2002\\x94\\x97as opposed to simply the year employed for other countries\\x92 victories\\x97presented highlights from the game. Unlike all the other nations featured in the campaign, Japan had not quite yet won the cup itself. But advancing this far in the competition was reason enough for celebration and for visually locating Japan as \\x93one of the winners.\\x94\\nThis celebration of Japan\\x92s mere participation in the event was also illustrated by television commercials featuring Japanese from all walks of life exchanging their shirts, suit, or school uniform coats when encountering each other on the street, as soccer players do after a particularly good game. Numerous Japanese sports fans indeed wore jerseys from teams outside Japan and gathered in bars frequented by foreigners to cheer other nations on. In fact, rather than expressing disappointment after Japan\\x92s elimination from the cup on June 18 after loosing to Turkey, Japanese fans gathered in Roppongi\\x97the area of Tokyo most frequented by foreigner\\x97to celebrate. Thus, the visual discourses surrounding Japan\\x92s hosting of the World Cup stressed Japan\\x92s involvement in larger world affairs, located Japan as a major player on the international scene, and promoted feelings of unity not only among Japanese, but also between Japanese and members of other nations.\\n\\nThe World Cup as a Japanese event\\nThe emphasis placed in Japanese popular culture on multiculturalism does not mean, however, that Japanese cultural specificity was completely erased from soccer-related imagery during the World Cup. On the contrary, much of this imagery integrated Japanese cultural elements into Japan\\x92s celebration of international and intercultural exchange. For instance, posters used all over Tokyo to welcome tourists in six different languages, superimposed a soccer ball over a reproduction of the famous \\x93wave\\x94 woodcut print, an immediately recognizable symbol of Japanese traditional aesthetic. Another poster in the same ad campaign used an idyllic representation of Mt. Fuji (photograph included here, but could not submit electronically)\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, much of the imagery designed to promote the event employed the cartoonish features characteristic of Japanese graphic arts heavily influenced by a long tradition of comic books and animation.\\nMembers of the Japanese team, such as Hidetoshi Tanaka and Junichi Inamoto, also became cultural icons whose faces appeared on publications targeted at Westerners as well as Japanese. In fact, most of the coverage of the event turned into a celebration of Japanese popular culture\\x97the youth-oriented culture most representative of the new generation of Japanese likely to claim soccer, as opposed to the more \\x93traditional\\x94 baseball, as their sport. Extremely popular young Japanese celebrity Kimura Takuya was chosen to hosts the coverage of the opening ceremonies for NHK, the Japanese public television channel. Soccer was quickly integrated into Japanese popular culture and Japanese popular culture integrated into soccer.\\nAs soon as the Cup started, the famous Sanrio characters\\x97from Hello Kitty to Badzmaru\\x97who have contributed to the spread of the Japanese \\x93kawairashiisa\\x94 craze to the rest of the world, started to sport the colors of the Japanese team, along with more indigenous characters such as the robot cat Doraemon or the fuzzy king of the forest from one of the most celebrated children\\x92s movies, Totoro. This integration of soccer into all aspects of Japanese popular culture served to turn the World Cup 2002 into a Japanese event. While Japan shared the limelight with Korea, and while this cooperation was generally recognized in official materials, the colors of the J-team very much dominated the spectrum of media coverage in Japan. Even Cookie Monster, Elmo and Big Bird opted not to support their home teams and donned blue and white jerseys.\\n\\nDomesticating foreign culture\\nIndeed, cultural imports also fell victim to the Japanese strand of sokka feeva that struck Tokyo in the early summer. Either \\x93claimed\\x94 as Japanese\\x97such as the Sesame Street characters mentioned above\\x97or presented as being \\x93on Japan\\x92s side,\\x94 foreigners and their cultural manifestations were effectively and safely integrated within the Japanese popular cultural environment in the visual discourses surrounding the World Cup. For instance, foreign soccer players were not only used to advertise products all over Japan, but they were often used to advertise Japanese products. Representations of foreigners also typically erased territorially grounded references to cultural environments outside Japan. While Tanaka was photographed with a smiley Caucasian boy in what seemed to be the street of a European country for a cell phone ad, foreign players were posed against a colored, or at least culturally neutral background. Displayed in the streets of Tokyo, these deterritorialized images of foreign players\\x97often accompanied by Japanese typographic elements\\x97very much became an integral part of the Japanese visual environment.\\n\\x93Foreign players\\x94 were also available for purchase in the form of small plastic figurines sold at every corner store, or distributed for free with various soft drinks (some of them were even part of the bottle cap). These mini-players came equipped with a short bibliography identifying their name and the team/country they played for. Fans who drink a lot of soda were encouraged to collect them all.\\nEven potentially more disturbing aspects of foreign culture were similarly commodified and domesticated on the Japanese popular cultural scene. While Japanese officials occasionally expressed concern over foreigners\\x92 (mis)behavior in their public relations campaigns\\x97one poster seen at every train station suggested, in English, \\x93let\\x92s safely enjoy the World Cup together\\x94 and offered advice on appropriate behavior\\x97other popular cultural texts celebrated the exotic \\x93darker side\\x94 of Western touristic invasion. One Japanese magazine titled Furigan (the Japanese pronunciation of \\x93hooligan,\\x94 as violent British soccer fans are known) provided advice on how to develop an \\x93authentic\\x94 furigan style. One could even use the magazine to order small furigan figurines similar to those featuring the players, but sporting blood stains and angry expressions instead. Once turned into plastic representations to be collected by excited high school girls, however, these shady foreigners lost much of their threatening character.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe soccer World Cup and other sports events of international significance provide a fascinating terrain for the study of the construction of national identity. The imagery surrounding Japan\\x92s first hosting of the cup created a visual discourse of international friendship and multiculturalism in which Japan was promoted as a major player. Not only was Japan presented as an important participant in this world event\\x97and hence in world events in general\\x97but the event itself was turned into a Japanese-style celebration of commodified global cultural integration.\\n\\nWorks cited\\nAlabarces, P. and RodrÌguez, M.

Following an application of institutional change principles laid out by Meyer and Rowan (1983), this study examines the implementation of the TAAS test in the Texas education system. From a review of public information from the TEA and news reports from the initial year of testing in 1990 up to 1999, public communication in the popular press is examined as it serves as the border between resistance and legitimization. A model is developed to explain the pattern that emerges from this review, and a metaphor of inoculation is proposed to explain the model more fully.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\nThe purpose of this paper is to challenge the prominent association of globalisation with Westernisation. This argument is developed through a case study of the Taiwanese publishing industry. The publishing industry in Taiwan, for example, deeply influenced though it is by the West, forbids a simple equating of globalization with Westernization, such as the conventional literature assumes. On the contrary, it reflects a complex series of interactions with other Chinese language markets.\\nIn studying how globalization influences the publishing industry in modern Taiwan, I consider Taiwanese publishing in the global market, and the publishing of other countries in the Taiwanese market. In particular. I focus on four areas: the cultural flow of publishing, the relationship between globalization and language, publishing and technology, and the production process in the global market. To do so, I critically review the relevant literature and gauge the complexity of cultural flows when Taiwanese books cross borders. The four areas are reviewed from theoretical perspectives, using empirical data from interviews, concerning, for example, the cultural flows between the publishing industry in Taiwan and global markets, traces of cultural imperialism within these cultural flows, and the hybridization process in the publishing industry.\\nThis paper examines the complexity of the cultural flows of books as they cross borders and questions the theoretical assumptions of Globalization and Westernization. It also presents evidence that communication between East and West through books can build a relationship of cooperation, and can improve the understanding between East and West beyond any relationship involving cultural imperialism.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Taking it to the Streets:\\nMainstream Media Coverage of Anti-Global Capital Protests\\nAbstract Submitted to the International Communication Association 2003 Conference\\n\\nThis paper examines mainstream media coverage of events staged by global capitalists at the turn of the twenty-first century and the protests consistently mounted against them. It begins with the \"Battle of Seattle\" in the winter of 1999, when 70,000 people shut down a meeting of the World Trade Organization. Over the next two years, scores of protests against global capitalism were mounted at similar gatherings in the United States and around the world, including Washington D.C., New York, Philadelphia, Porto Alegre, Madrid, Barcelona, Goteburg, Davos, Salzburg, London, Paris, and Genoa. The Big Media could not ignore these protests, but they did strive to symbolically contain them. As one participant-observer told In These Times, \"Most of what has been written is so inaccurate that I can\\x92t decide if the reporters in question should be charged with conspiracy or simply incompetence.\"\\nThis paper combines textual analysis with political economy to examine the specific strategies employed by the media to symbolically contain the protests. These strategies include the depiction of anti-globalization activists as a fractious and disparate lot with too many different causes and internal conflicts to sustain a unified movement, and a focus on the police as a highly trained and disciplined force whose difficult job it was to protect people and private property by outwitting protesters. I believe the topic is particularly relevant to the theme of the 2003 ICA conference, \"Border Crossings,\" both because it combines political economy with textual analysis and because it examines media coverage of the people\\x92s attempts to \"crash the gates\" of parties of the wealthy and powerful throughout the world.',\n",

It has as its site an information-technology organization at a large western university. This public bureaucracy merged three, disparate, high-technology cultures to provide integrated computer and telecommunication services for its campus. Part of a two-year case study, this paper makes three contributions to our understanding of organizational cultural change. First, cultural change in the high-technology, public bureaucracy studied exhibits similar patterns to private-sector, high-technology organizations undergoing change. Second, the merged, independent technical cultures studied handle the tensions resulting from a mandated consolidation by reproducing their subcultures while adopting new organizational outcomes. Third, the behaviors of the members studied lend support to the claim that full integration or consensus is not a necessary feature of a productive culture. In the organization studied, a discourse of communication enabled the simultaneous development of an integrated culture and the reproduction of the subcultural identities within the context of technological evolution of services.',\n",

In a related vein, extant literature on telework has largely failed to examine how people work when they work at a distance (Bailey & Kurland, 2002). Drawing on interviews conducted with 46 teleworkers, this study investigates how workers' teleworking practices interrelate with other elements of the social-technological system, in particular, relationships with the organization, with coworkers, and with available technology. We use this information to consider the burgeoning relationship between broadband and work practices in organizational settings. We conclude by identifying opportunities in teleworking for increasing demand for broadband services.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'One of the most persistent claims about the Internet has been its unregulability. In cyberspace it is allegedly impossible to make enforceable rules about users\\' online activities. As a network of networks based on packet-switched communications operating under the TCP/IP protocol, it has been understood that the Internet\\'s inner workings render impossible central control, the identification of users, and, ultimately, punishment for misbehavior. Furthermore, as a global communication system whose functionality immediately connects individuals from around the world, the Internet\\'s ubiquity allegedly creates an insurmountable thicket of institutional conflicts. With so many governments\\' jurisdictions overlapping in cyberspace, no one\\'s law is supreme. Thus control - the ability to unilaterally influence user activities - and governance - coherent rulemaking for cyberspace as a whole - have both been understood to be impossible. The result -- often praised, sometimes cursed -- is an \"electronic frontier\" in which great freedom and even lawlessness prevail.\\n\\nFor better or worse, this claim of unregulability is mistaken. The claim about insurmountable technical barriers to control rests on an incomplete understanding of Internet technology. The Internet consists of more than a network of networks based on packet switched communications. It also includes the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a highly centralized addressing system and which is essential to nearly all Internet communication. The DNS provides a central point from which to control user behavior.\\n\\nLikewise, the claim of insurmountable institutional barriers to governance rests on an incomplete understanding of law and jurisdictions. True, the public laws made by governments clash in cyberspace. However, private law - the law of contracts -- can operate across borders. Private law provides a means by which to promulgate global regulation of Internet activities. An arrangement in which every user signed a contract with a central private entity would give that private entity the power of a global regulator. Since its early days the administrative subsystem within the DNS has required every operator of an Internet identifier (domain name) to sign a contract.\\n\\nRealization of global regulation through the DNS is no longer hypothetical. In 1998 the DNS was placed under the authority of a private corporation: ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. ICANN is a private, non-profit entity whose official mandate includes the control of the DNS. Its decisions are subject to review by the United States government, which must approve of major ICANN decisions before they are implemented. Nonetheless, with its ability to control users and to promulgate global, contract-based rules, ICANN realizes the capabilities of Internet regulation.\\n\\nI offer here a detailed analysis of how Internet governance is realized by ICANN. My purpose is to render comprehensible the interrelationship between technology, administration, and governance, explaining how a computer network addressing system makes regulation possible. To do this I define regulation, control, and governance, and I analyze the Internet\\'s domain name system (DNS). Then I explain how the former are realized through the latter. I touch on, but do not analyze in any great depth, the substance of the regulations promulgated to date and whether they are good or bad\\n\\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, I examine whether this new system of regulation is legitimate. Although any assessment of absolute legitimacy is problematic, ICANN clearly lacks most of the common mechanisms to ensure representation of relevant views, accountability to outside parties, and transparency in its operations. As a result, the organization\\'s continued existence depends on its success in global power politics. It seems likely that its organizational form will continue to evolve until powerful interests reach a stable equilibrium and embody that equilibrium in ICANN\\'s institutional design. ICANN could also fracture or fail if a rival institution should be able to win the support of sufficient number of influential parties. In other words, ICANN\\'s lack of legitimacy makes it vulnerable to rather crude power politics.\\n\\nICANN is significant not only for the Internet but for global governance generally. As an emerging new institutional form it can be characterized in three ways, depending on the significance accorded the roles of the US government and the private corporation. The first view emphasizes US hegemony. Here, the private corporation can be understood as the mere agent of the US through which the US embodies its commands in contract law so as to circumvent other nations\\' sovereignty. US global hegemony is achieved through private law. Second, ICANN may be characterized as a semi-independent regulator in which powerful private entities make global rules for cyberspace. In this view, the US possesses unique veto rights but does not really control ICANN. Third, should the US act on its public commitment to grant ICANN its independence, ICANN would represent a new kind of private sovereign. In a manner similar to how the private International Olympic Committee controls those global games, ICANN would control cyberspace.\\n\\n###',\n",

Data were collected for 18,771 days of domestic violence, and game-related variables were collected for 794 games. Three analyses were conducted looking at structural, competitive, and dispositional variables. The first analysis showed that there was no unmediated relationship between football and domestic violence. After controlling for seasonal and weekday variations, two further analyses revealed a complex relationship. The Super Bowl was found to be associated with an increase in domestic violence similar to that of many other holidays. Finally, a latent effect was found for games expected to be especially close. As has been seen with homicides after prize fights and single-auto fatalities after heavily publicized suicides, domestic violence incidents significantly increased three days after games expected to be especially close. This relationship diminished as one\\x92s home team was expected to blow out -- or be blown out by -- the other team.',\n",

This article explores this by looking at the relationship between taste cultures in Dutch television comedy. Survey data showed four taste cultures: clusters liked by old and disliked by younger people and vice versa; a lowbrow style disliked by higher educated informants, and a highbrow style unknown to lower educated informants. Interview materials are used to understand the mechanisms behind this asymmetric pattern of knowledge and dislike, and to answer the more general question how television can sustain a taste hierarchy like this, with one taste culture exclusive to high status viewers. Taste, it will be argued, has to be understood not only as a pattern of preferences and aversion, but as a form of cultural knowledge. This cultural knowledge varies between groups, in nature and amount, and is crucial in the perpetuation of taste hierarchies',\n",

Given past literature indicating that a causal relationship exists between television viewing and materialism (Churchill and Moschis, 1979) and between materialism and social capital (Rahn and Transue, 1998), this analysis proposes that the relationship between television viewing and social capital can be explained through television\\x92s effects on materialism, and materialism\\x92s effects on social capital, measured here in terms of civic engagement.

For this study, these station data were supplemented with additional data on market and station characteristics. The results support the FCC's conclusion that networked owned and operated stations provide more combined local news and public affairs programming than other affiliates, and that stations with an ownership interest in newspapers provide more combined local news and public affairs programming than stations with no newspaper holdings. However, the results also indicate that the predictors for local news programming are different than those for public affairs programming, and that a variety of market and station characteristics are of equal or greater importance than O&O status and newspaper ownership.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cable television news channels and online news sites appear to offer interested voters the ability to follow the presidential election campaign more closely than ever before. However, survey research looking at the extent to which Americans are taking advantage of these newer media is incomplete. Rarely is new media use adequately assessed in surveys, and no extant study has simultaneously examined exposure to contemporary news channels over the course of several weeks. The present study uses an aggregate-level analysis of naturally-occurring news consumption behavior to determine whether public selection of broadcast news programs, cable news channels, and online news outlets follows the primary election schedule and fluctuations in voter interest in the election. The results suggest that cable and online news exposure are more responsive to voter interest in the election than is broadcast news exposure. In addition, the data reveal that newsreaders from across the country use the World Wide Web to gather election information from sites of newspapers located in states holding primary elections. The study demonstrates that aggregate-level use of the newer media is responsive to changes in the political environment. Audiences have a growing number of options for finding information about politics, and they seem willing to take advantage of these new opportunities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Call centers are a fast growing segment of the telecommunications industry. Research of call centers has explored issues including the work practices (Pentland, 1992), organizational structure (Kinnie, Hutchinson, & Purcell, 2000) and surveillance methods of this industry (Bain & Taylor, 2000); yet most studies have overlooked an examination of how interaction with technologies create call center work as a complex task. This study looks at the ways in which an information technology call center within a large Western University operates as a complex workspace. Using communities of practice theory (Wenger, 1998), the study illustrates the ways in which workers make sense of workspace, rules, interaction, task and technology. In contrast to the common view that call center work is autonomous and individual, we argue there are possibilities for viewing the call center as a collaborative learning environment. Communities of practice, as a social learning theory, allows us to see the ways in which call center employees not only make sense of the work processes through the workspace, rules, interaction, task and technology, but they also continue to learn about their jobs and each other.',\n",

The circumstances surrounding the Civil War led to the birth of blues music, which was created to do the cultural work of an oppressed people. The same music can serve women to take back control of their sexuality and to gain empowerment to reverse the conditions of the American burqa. Two songs are offered as examples of the role the blues can play in asserting personal identity and revealing desires that include celebration of ones sexuality. By creating dialog and making connections, the blues reveals the hypocrisy of patriarchal society to be replaced by the multiplicity of real people.',\n",

Once when providing information to the technology (e.g., filling out a yellow page) and once when using information from the technology (e.g., using yellow pages to find a knowledgeable colleague). Structural equation modeling was used to see whether the influences on appropriation as proposed by AST were operating in the appropriation of content in Yellow Pages.

A survey questionnaire was used to address a series of hypotheses and research questions regarding teachers\\x92 perceptions of their emotional labor and the extent to which their identifications (both role and organization) and perceived social support mitigate the negative consequences commonly associated with feelings of emotional dissonance. Results indicate that role identification significantly moderated the relationship between emotional dissonance and perceived (in)authenticity of oneself.

Although solicited and unsolicited support, from both peers and supervisors, did not moderate the relationship between emotional dissonance and any of the dependent variables, the interactions between emotional dissonance, job satisfaction and peer solicited support and emotional dissonance, job satisfaction and advisor unsolicited support did approach significance.

       "  'abstract': 'Considerable research suggests that social support is one of the most important provisions of the marital relationship and is an important determinant of marital satisfaction. To date, however, research exploring linkages between spousal support and marital satisfaction has not systematically examined whether some types of social support (e.g., emotional, informational, tangible) are especially strong correlates of marital satisfaction. In addition, it is not currently known whether the magnitude of the association between different types of spousal support and marital satisfaction varies as a function of factors such as sex and nationality. Thus, the present study was conducted to determine the types of spousal support most strongly associated with marital satisfaction and whether these associations vary with gender and culture. Participants (100 recently married Americans and 102 recently married Chinese) completed instruments providing assessments of marital quality, dyadic adjustment, and five types of experienced spousal support (emotional, esteem, informational, network, tangible). Despite certain measurement problems, results indicated that spousal emotional support was clearly the strongest correlate of marital satisfaction, and that the magnitude of this association does not vary as a function of gender or culture. Implications of the findings are discussed, as are directions for future research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Electronic instructional and communication technologies are seen as engines for institutional reforms and powerful agents for the development of distance education programs. Similarly, discussion on the recent introduction and proliferation of web-based course management tools like Blackboard, WebCT and Prometheus have tended to focus on their potential to change institutions of higher education by facilitating distributed or distance learning. However, in order to gain further insights on web-based courseware and its adoption and use, it is insufficient to examine its features and functions. This paper argues that instructional technologies should be analyzed in context from the historical and organizational environ from which they emerge. Using structuration theory as a macro theoretical lens and applying complementary theoretical concepts of the genre and metaphor in organizational settings, this research addresses the mutual shaping of educational technologies and traditional institutions of higher education. The empirical focus is a case study that investigated the changing perceptions of the classroom and work practices of teachers using Blackboard, an electronic course management software in an institution of higher education. Results illustrate the various changes in the classroom meeting genre as the main genre of the course as instructors shaped and reconstructed their practices, rules, norms and expectations. The empirical evidence also sheds light on the role and metaphorical function of Blackboard on the adoption and pedagogic innovation of the technology. Finally, implications for future research are discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this short essay, a particular Japanese term, wakimae, is investigated aiming to develop the concept as a theoretical construct within the framework of face-to-face interaction and investigate a unique nature of face-to-face interaction in the Japanese culture. This type of emic research is expected to contribute not only to a better understanding of an implicit theory of interaction in Japanese culture, but also to the different type of cross-cultural studies (i.e., the etic approach). That is, the relative conceptualizations of related communication concepts to wakimae (e.g., politeness), which is often assumed to be absolute or universal across cultures, can be better understood and, in turn, can be validly re-defined as an analytic tool for the future comparative studies. In this paper, a case study is reported that explores the folk knowledge of the concept among the Japanese speakers. The preliminary analysis of the data revealed that the concept wakimae involves a wide range of interactional factors that are expected to guide one\\x92s behavior in general or specific situations. Specifically, it was found that wakimae is specifically conceptualized as one\\x92s keen sensitivity to or capability of correctly/effectively assessing such factors as a) situational context, b) situational limit/risk, c) the partner\\x92s physical or mental status, d) one\\x92s own social status/role, e) one\\x92s own personal limits/characters, f) manner/rules, g) morals/ethics, h) common sense, and i) natural laws/reasons. These interactional factors were seen to guide both volitional (e.g., goal-oriented, task-oriented, strategic, etc.) and non-volitional behavior (e.g., obligatory language use, ritualistic behaviors, rule-governed behaviors in specific events, etc.). Also, the data suggested that the concept becomes an issue if the lack of wakimae in a behavior is expected to cause socially or interpersonally negative consequences, which might endanger a) the success of the social event/group, b) the success of the individual, c) the interpersonal relationship, d) the social relationship, and/or e) the actor\\x92s own impression.',\n",

(2) What are the implications of these relationships for the quality of dialogue among participants holding diverse perspectives? Our boundary-bridging, quantitative-qualitative analysis uncovered previously hidden patterns in communicating behaviors, suggesting that an emphasis on consensusing and dissensusing may inhibit communication processes necessary for effective public sphere dialogue.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a television cult series about a California valley girl who slays vampires and other demons, has attracted substantial scholarly attention. Less is known about a newly-released fighting video game based on the series. This paper provides an analysis of the construction of Buffy as a hero in the video game, comparing it to her portrayal in the television show. The analysis suggests that the video game provides a uni-dimensional construction of female heroism, based on the Warrior archetype and omitting the Caregiver/Martyr archetype often present in descriptions of heroes. The series\\x92 collectivist style of problem solving and focus on relationships is absent from the game, which emphasizes women\\x92s sexual characteristics (to a lesser extent than video games targeting males),\\nand includes terms that are derogatory to women. Like other constructions of female heroism, the game provides support for the idea that a woman can be strong but she must also be feminine.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Objective: The purpose of this analysis was to compare the content of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverage advertising content to which adolescents are exposed in the United States.\\nMethods: A census of beverage advertising in popular magazines and on network television (n=757 ads) during the months of November, 1999-April, 2000 was analyzed for content and frequency.\\nResults: By far, the most alcoholic beverage ads appeared in Sports Illustrated (110) followed by Rolling Stone (98) and Playboy (75). Alcohol advertising outnumbers nonalcohol advertising by a ratio of 3 to 1. All types of beverage ads emphasized relaxation and portrayals of young adults. Alcohol was almost never associated with dining. Ads rarely portrayed risky situations but frequently were placed in magazines featuring sports and sexually oriented content. Alcohol ads demonstrated an emphasis on sexual and social stereotyping of women, and a lack of ethnic and age-related diversity. Themes and settings of alcohol ads were similar to those present in nonalcohol ads. One of every six magazine alcohol ads, and one of every 14 video-based ads, appeared to target underage drinkers.\\nConclusions: Alcohol is advertised heavily in media outlets favored by youth. Alcohol advertisements also include many stereotypes and many elements known to appeal to youth, particularly youth already at risk to drink alcohol. That themes in alcohol ads parallel those in nonalcohol ads may further increase youth\\x92s receptivity.',\n",

This model distinguishes two central knowledge sharing processes (knowledge donating and knowledge collecting), and specifies the influence of commitment, communication climate and CMC on both these processes.\\nWe used AMOS, a software package for structural equation modelling, to test this model. Our results suggest that both commitment and communication climate are key variables in explaining knowledge sharing, and that CMC use also has a positive influence on this process (through commitment). Furthermore, the distinction between the processes of knowledge donating and knowledge collecting, respectively, turns out to be a relevant one. The antecedents of both processes are not entirely similar (commitment, for instance, influences knowledge donating but not collecting), and they are also interrelated: knowledge collecting can be seen as a condition for knowledge donating.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Language and Social Interaction scholars often criticize speech act theorists for using invented sentences and fictional situations to illustrate their points, a practice which, according to these detractors, fails to capture the complexity and sequentiality of human interactions. In contrast, speech act theorists tend to accuse their opponents of falling into empiricism by collecting and analyzing naturally occurring pieces of interaction without truly explaining the inferential mechanisms by which interlocutors come or fail to coordinate their activities. This paper shows how these two approaches to language and social interaction could actually benefit from each other. More precisely, I propose a reinterpretation of the critique Schegloff (1988) addressed to Searle in his analysis of presequences and indirection. Contrary to what Schegloff contends, speech act theory can explain the inferential mechanisms by which interlocutors come to not only produce and understand presequences, but also mistake them for requests for information. Although Schegloff is right to point out that the phenomenon of presequences has not been anticipated by speech act theory, he is wrong to think that this model is ill equipped to explain the logic of the production and (mis-) comprehension of this conversational phenomenon. Interestingly enough, speech act theory - and this is the analytical power of this theory - helps us anticipate forms of presequences that have not yet being identified by conversation analysts.',\n",

The results of the research indicate five important features of cultural beliefs and values and five filmic elements that provide one possible explanation for the popularity of Nang Nak. In addition to discussing those cultural beliefs/values and filmic elements, this study argues that Western theories can play a meaningful role in the analysis of Asian films.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Previous research has shown that people appear to use television fiction memories when asked to make a judgment about social reality. It has been argued that such memory based judgment occurs because people mislabel fictitious memories or because they do not take information about source validity into account. This study argues that fiction contains cues which tell some viewers that some of what they see resembles reality. In that case a viewer makes an on line, stimulus based judgment and learns a fact while watching fiction. This \\x93sudden insight\\x94 was called the data setting effect.\\nIn a sample of 501 Flemish students 29 1f thirteen year olds had knowledge about police procedures in the USA which they could only have obtained by watching TV fiction. Knowledge levels increased with age. 74.4 1003410535f eighteen year olds possessed the same knowledge.\\nThe paper argues fist, that that the data setting effect is strong and persistent. Second, that it may occur at an early age, which may explain why little or no association between measures of viewing volume and knowledge of the TV world is found in adult age groups. Third, the implication of the first two conclusions is that in TV effects research age should not be treated as a demographic background variable, but rather as a measure of overall lifetime TV viewing.',\n",

The desert not only represents the border between \"utopia\" and the rest of society, but also the border territory between the simulated and the real. In combination, Alphaville, Westworld, and The Matrix offer labyrinths and deserts to metaphorically illustrate the dystopian anxieties associated with computer and new media in contemporary technological society.',\n",

This paper analyses the development of digital TV in Italy. It examines how government policies, market forces, and demand factors are\\nshaping the current restructuring of the Italian broadcasting system in its migration from analogue to digital TV. The focus is on two issues that have emerged as key bottlenecks in the digital TV supply chain: the control of premium sports rights and the control of the digital TV home terminal. We argue that the new market structure and the new equilibrium between public and private operators will largely depend on how these two issues are sorted out by market forces and regulatory battles at the national and European level. We also argue that, as implemented to date, the introduction of digital terrestrial services is unlikely to challenge the comfortable duopoly between RAI and Mediaset in the Italian TV sector.\",\n",

The effect of ego involvement and salience involvement on the comprehension of a health news article is evaluated using multiple regression analysis. Hypothesis 1 was supported: salience involvement with the message topic significantly contributed to comprehension. Hypothesis 2 was supported: ego involvement significantly contributed to comprehension controlling for the effect of salience involvement. Ego involvement was also shown to contribute significantly to the accuracy , rather than the inference, portion of the comprehension test.

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Sometimes romantic partners engage in face attacks against each other. Based on Felson\\x92s impression management theory, an individual\\x92s face loss, feelings of being hurt and explicit responses were hypothesized to vary with the type of face attack expressed by a romantic partner, the social context in which the attack occurred and the victim\\x92s argumentativeness. The results of an experiment in which undergraduates were asked to respond to hypothetical scenarios indicated that individuals would feel greater hurt, experience more face loss from the attack and be more likely to challenge the attack when insulted rather than teased. Regardless of whether the face attack was a tease or insult, individuals reported greater face loss would result from being attacked in public than in private and when the onlookers were friends rather than strangers. Also, individuals expected their own friends to be more supportive of challenging the attack than their partner\\x92s friends. However, individuals were less willing to challenge the face attack when it occurred in the presence of onlookers than in private. These findings imply that when face attacks occur, individuals are sensitive to the type of face attack but also are concerned about suffering more face loss by challenging the attack in the presence of others. Argumentativeness was negatively related to hurt, face loss and pressure to end the challenge and positively related to willingness to challenge a face attack. These findings imply that not all individuals who experience face attacks will respond in the same way.',\n",

However, as of yet there has been no clear discussion or demonstration of how political discussion translates into increased political knowledge. The present study proposes three explanations ? exposure (similar to the two step flow), anticipatory elaboration (linking work on uses and gratifications and news information processing), and discussion-generated elaboration (focusing on how discussion itself can influence information processing) ? for this observed empirical relationship. In order to test these three explanations, data from the 2000 American National Election Study and a local community survey during the 1996 presidential election were employed. Findings suggest that the direct relationship between discussion and knowledge may be mediated through motivations and information processing behaviors. These findings support the anticipatory elaboration and discussion-generated elaboration explanations while questioning the exposure explanation.',\n",

The present study is different from prior sex appeal studies in that it examines both believability and reptilian emotion as possible mediators of sexiness effects to track both the rational and emotional responses of the audience. Gender, age, sexual orientation, product involvement, religious anti-sex conservatism, religiosity, trait sexual excitement, and trait shopping excitement are included to assess individual differences in the present study. Several new scales are constructed in this study to tap the areas where no existing scales have touched. This study treats perceived sexiness as a multi-dimensional variable and manipulates it along three different dimensions. Path analysis was used to develop this sex-appeal model of advertisement. A two (high sexiness vs. low sexiness) by two (high congruity vs. low congruity) by two (model replication) by two (product replication) repeated measure design is used. Gender is identified as the major moderator variable and thus two separate models are developed for each gender. In general this study supports that sex appeal positively influences attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the brand and purchase intention.',\n",

An experiment (N = 391) was conducted that manipulated type of hierarchy (explicit vs. implicit), whether the hierarchy was primed or not, and the location in the hierarchy to which a message was directed. The results show that, as both models suggest, linguistic organizational structures influence attitude and belief change. However, as the spatial model suggests, such change is constrained less by a concept\\x92s relative position in the structure and more by the strength of the concept\\x92s association with other concepts in that structure.

Using a time series analysis approach (August 1994 \\x96 September 1998) with monthly aggregated data, it is shown that the media follow negative conditions in the labor market more closely than positive conditions. Although the television coverage fails to exert a direct effect on voting preferences, it does exert an independent and indirect effect through its impact on the public\\x92s perceptions of candidates, party competence, and the importance of unemployment as a national problem.

The study focuses on forms of interorganizational relations (IORs) and assesses the overall network patterns among ASPs during 1998-2001. The goal is to explore the underlying processes of such relations via mapping the network structure of the industry. Resource dependency theory (RDT) is utilized in the analysis of the industry. Sixty-Nine ASPs that have (within-industry) IORs with other ASPs are examined. The data analyses show that the industry is under the influence of economies of large scale and that the dominant ASPs with various IORs tend to focus on more generic type of service. Small companies should focus on provision of more specific types of services. The notion of resource dependence is discussed in relation to Giddens¡¯ theory of Structuration in theoretical interpretations of the results. In short, I argue that the notion of regularities found in structural and function approaches (such as RDT, for example) should be related to what people and organizations do in specific economic settings, rather than being related to sui-generis feature of such regularities.',\n",

Our Lady has been revered as a saint, prayed to as a compassionate Mother, and held up as a model of ideal womanhood for all Catholics of Latin America, but particularly of Mexico, for over 400 years. Portrayal of Our Lady traditionally uses codified stylistic elements that rhetorically interpret her substantive elements, and may be considered one genre. Whereas that genre continues to the present day, contemporary Latina artists have, for the past 25 years, been rearranging and changing the stylistic elements to re-interpret the substantive elements of Our Lady. This rearrangement expresses a different gender construction that may ignite controversy within the Catholic community. The stylistic elements used by the Latina artists are recognizable by anyone familiar with Our Lady but the expression is different enough to give rise to a sub-genre within the Our Lady genre.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the last decade the concepts of \\x93border\\x94 and \\x93borderland\\x94 have moved beyond studies of international political boundaries in disciplines like political science, history and anthropology into a variety of other fields, becoming metaphors useful in describing many types of human boundaries in addition to geopolitical ones. This paper extends the border metaphor to the home, specifically from an information policy perspective. It suggests that a variety of information policy issues can be viewed as arising where information technology is re-shaping the borderland between the world outside and the world inside the home. It begins with a historical definition of the concept of \\x93home,\\x94 explores an organizing framework for considering the complex functions of the home and suggests how key issues in information policy relate to the home in light of those functions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Images of nations, however right or wrong they might be, seem to form, fundamentally, through a very complex communication process involving varied information sources. The process starts with one´s experience in very early life. Research has demonstrated that images of nations are very stable and resistant to change. The influence of schoolbooks in forming images of foreign nations and countries should not be underestimated. In the study about 40 schoolbooks (on religious education, geography, history and German language education) still in use have been analysed. In the textbooks India very often is compared with with China whereby the disadvantage is on India´s side. The main feature of India´s image is unbalanced development:On the one side there are incredibly rich people, on the other side so many people are living in absolute poverty. India is used as example for Third World problems like poverty, population explosion, child-labour and discrimination of women. In the textbooks on religion there is a partition in the good (Christians) on the one side and Hinduism on the other side. Only sometimes is India which seems to have no history introduced as a democracy. Proposals for the embetterment of the quality of textbooks are developed because schoolbooks in use today still present the very old stereotypes.',\n",

       "  'title': 'The Impact of Animation and Sound Effects on Attention and Memory Processes',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"The ability of computers to deliver information in multiple forms and presentation styles makes them an attractive resource for delivery of instruction to children who have different skill levels and learning styles. However, in spite of broad declarations about the positive impact of multimedia on children\\x92s cognitive development and academic achievement, to date there is little empirical evidence to support these claims. This study will use the Limited Capacity Model of Mediated Message Processing to find out how children respond to specific features, and combinations of features, in a multimedia lesson. Specifically, this research will examine whether 9-to-12 year old children orient to the use of animation and/or sound effects in a multimedia lesson and whether these features affect recognition and recall of content.\\nInformation Processing and Mediated Messages\\nAccording to the Limited Capacity Model of Mediated Message Processing, people have a limited amount of cognitive resources with which to \\x93perceive stimuli, turn them into mental representations, do mental work on those representations, and reproduce them in the same or in an altered form,\\x94 (Lang, 2000, p.47). The model consists of three sub-processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Memory for a message is dependent on the outcome of all three sub-processes. Resources for processing are allocated to each of the tasks, and when there are insufficient resources to perform all of the tasks, some aspect of processing is inadequate or fails.\\nSeveral researchers have used the limited capacity model to investigate the effects of structural and content features on attention to and memory for television messages (Lang, 1990; Lang, Geiger, Strickwerda, & Sumner, 1993; Lang, Dhillon, & Dong, 1995; Lang, Newhagen, & Reeves, 1996; Lang, Zhou, Schwartz, Bolls, & Potter, 2000; Potter, 2000; Reeves, Thorson, Rothschild, McDonald, Hirsch, & Goldstein, 1985). In general, when a message has high levels of both structural features and arousing content, it will be liked and attended to by viewers, but resources needed for encoding will overload the processing system and memory for the message will be low.\\nMultimedia Learning\\nMultimedia is any combination of text, graphic art, sound, animation, and video delivered by a computer or other electronic means. Because multi-cue messages deliver more information than single-cue messages, utilization of multi-cue messages should result in greater learning. However, studies investigating this hypothesis have produced mixed results (Hartman, 1961; Ketcham & Heath, 1962; Severin, 1967b; Spaulding, 1956; Van Mondfrans & Travers, 1964). Severin (1967a) explained the inconsistent results by the degree of redundancy among cues. Studies that used cues with no redundancy between them, such as text accompanied by unrelated narrative, found multi-cue messages to be less effective than single-cue messages. In these studies, the unrelated cues likely required more resources for processing than were available. Studies that used cues that were essentially completely redundant, such as text paired with word-for-word narration, found no difference between multi-cue and single-cue messages. In these studies, the cues did not compete with each other for processing resources, but neither did they supply useful new information. Studies that used cues that were partially redundant, such as pictures paired with related narration, found multi-cue messages more effective than single-cue messages. In these studies, the cues appeared to provide a combination of redundancy and new information such that processing was not overloaded and the additional cues were useful. The current study will examine two components of multimedia: animation and sound effects. All animation and sound effect cues will be created so as to be partially redundant in order to provide new information without overloading processing.\\nCurrent Study\\nBecause humans have an innate tendency to respond to things that move, animated messages are more likely to capture attention than static messages.\\nH1: The presence of animation in a multimedia lesson will elicit an orienting response.\\nBecause they make things noticeable, animated stimuli will compel greater allocation of processing resources to encoding.\\nH2: The presence of animation in a multimedia lesson will result in increased recognition for the information presented.\\nBy guiding attention to the important concepts in the verbal information, animation serves as a mnemonic device (ChanLin, 1998), and provides a framework for storing message information. Thus animated information should be more effectively stored than non-animated information.\\nH3: The presence of animation in a multimedia lesson will result in increased recall for the information presented.\\nSounds can elaborate upon visual stimuli by providing information about invisible structures, dynamic change, and abstract concepts (Bishop & Cates, 2001). Like animation, sound can capture and guide attention and make things noticeable.\\nH4: The presence of sound effects in a multimedia lesson will elicit an orienting response.\\nH5: The presence of sound effects in a multimedia lesson will result in increased recognition for the information presented.\\nH6: The presence of sound effects in a multimedia lesson will result in increased recall for the information presented.\\nDesign\\nThe design of this study is a mixed Animation (2) X Sound Effect (2) X Message (4) X Order (4) factorial. Animation and Sound Effects are within-subjects factors; both have two levels, representing the presence or absence of the factor. These factors are completely crossed resulting in four categories of messages: no animation/no sound effect, animation/no sound effect, no animation/sound effect, and animation/sound effect. There are four messages in each Animation by Sound Effect category. Order is a between-subjects factor. Subjects will be randomly assigned to view one of the four orders.\\nDependent Variables\\nArousal. Physiological arousal will be measured using skin conductance as an indicator of activation in the sympathetic nervous system.\\nAttention. Orienting will be measured using phasic heart rate (there should be a short-term decrease in heart rate when viewers orient to an external stimulus) and cognitive effort will be measured using tonic heart rate (there should be a long-term deceleratory trend during periods of effort in attention to external stimuli).\\nEncoding. The efficiency of the encoding sub-process will be measured by a forced-choice, four-alternative, multiple-choice (recognition) test. The test will consist of 48 questions (3 for each slide in the lesson).\\nStorage. The efficiency of the storage sub-process will be measured by a cued recall test. For this test, subjects will be given a cue for each of the four topic areas and asked to tell the researcher as much as they can remember about that topic from the multimedia lesson.\\nProcess\\nNinety 9-to-12 year olds from schools in a Mid-western town will participate in the study in January, February, and March of 2003. Each subject will complete the experiment individually. After giving informed assent, subjects will be seated and sensors for measuring heart rate and skin conductance will be attached to the forearms and non-dominant hand. Subjects will then view the 16 slides in the computer lesson. Heart rate and skin conductance data will be collected during viewing. After viewing, the sensors will be removed and subjects will complete a distracter task. Following the distracter task, subjects will move to an adjoining room where they will be cued to various segments of the lesson and asked to describe everything they remember about the particular segment. Subjects\\x92 responses will be audio-taped for later transcription. After this cued recall task, subjects will complete a forced-choice, four-alternative, multiple-choice recognition test. They will also answer questions about preferred learning style (visual or audio) and provide demographic information.\\nResults from this study will contribute to the development of theory that can predict how specific components of multimedia interact with students' processing of information. This understanding will provide a framework for people who seek to produce effective instructional media products.\\n\\nReferences\\nBishop, M..J., & Cates, W.M. (2001).

       "  'abstract': 'Gossip is regular social communicative practice, yet little is known about the effects that this act has on perception of the gossip source. This study attempts to clarify how the act of gossip and being perceived as a gossip influences source perceptions and message quality. It is argued that liking, trust, and suspicion of the source and message are influenced by relationship type (friend or stranger) and gossip valence (positive, negative, neutral). Using gossip as the manipulation in an experimental design, 120 confederates were enlisted to interact with either friends or strangers (participants) and, subsequently, engage in or avoid gossip. No significant results were found for gossip\\x92s effect on message quality. Results, however, did determine that relationship type has a significant impact on gossip\\x92s effect, such that friends were liked and trusted more than strangers regardless of gossip practices, and suspected less than strangers regardless of gossip practices. Results for analyses of gossip valence indicate significant effects of gossip on levels of suspicion regardless of relationship type. Additionally, these results indicate that negative gossip significantly decreases trust and dramatically increases suspicion of strangers, whereas, negative positive gossip increases trust of strangers. Results and implications are discussed.',\n",

Structural equation modeling (SEM) and hierarchical regression modeling were simultaneously used to evaluate how mass media affect Korean immigrants¡¯ acculturation.

However, Korean media use was neither related to the immigrants¡¯ affinity for Korean culture nor acceptance of American culture. We surmise that the American mass media mainly reflect the American cultural climate, leading Korean immigrants to have a positive acceptance of American culture and a negative affinity for Korean culture. However, the Korean mass media in the U.S. generally reflect both hybrid Korean and American cultural values, which eventually lead to neither a positive nor negative perceptions about both American and Korean culture.',\n",

Exposure to broadcast news, however, influenced people\\x92s support for military intervention in countries that potentially threaten the United States. Although media had limited effects on shaping American\\x92s international opinions, respondents who were generally predisposed to trust other nations, as well as those who were generally isolationist, were less likely to feel threatened by specific countries and less likely to support armed intervention.

       "  'abstract': 'The present paper analyzes the 48 contiguous states of the Union in terms of their level of social capital and their ability to create and maintain on-line communities (Yahoo! groups). Drawing on Putnam\\x92s social capital theory it proposes that social capital is one of the most fundamental ingredients of social aggregates, be they off or on-line based. Geographic units will emanate a number of on-line formations and an overall amount of on-line activity commensurate with their social capital endowment. Multiple regression analysis indicates that state-level social capital linearly increases with increase in number of clubs per 100,000 state residents. Yet, the relationship between social capital and average weighted club activity, measured at state-level, is conditional and curvilinear. Social capital makes a difference, and a positive one, only for states under the mean in terms of social capital. States with a social capital endowment above the mean go in the opposite direction; they decline in terms of average club activity. The tentative explanation for these findings is that while high capital states facilitate on-line group creation, time and personal costs constrain the residents to focus more on their off-line lives and activities.',\n",

       "  'title': 'The Influence of Identity Status and Identity Processing Style on Adolescents\\x92 Goals for Relationship Rule Violations',\n",
       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'At any age, a person\\x92s identity serves as an information processing filter that structures the activation of identity-relevant information (Kihlstrom & Klein, 1994). The concepts and information relevant to the self also have an instrumental influence on decisions to pursue particular goals (Bandura, 1989). While all individuals have some sense of identity, individuals vary in the degree to which they possess a stable sense of self (Markstrom-Adams, 1992). As such, variations in identity stability should have implications for that information which guides goal-related decisions in identity-relevant contexts.\\n\\nThe implications of variations in identity development are particularly salient in adolescence (Samet & Kelly, 1987). Marcia (1966; 1988) argued that the degree to which an adolescent\\x92s identity can be considered to be \\x93developed\\x94 is a function the presence or absence of active self-exploration and firm identity commitments; varying levels of these two dimensions reflect four different identity statuses: (a) achievers, (b) moratoriums, (c) foreclosures, and (d) diffusions. Individuals who are identity achieved have committed to a given ideology or interpersonal style following a period of intense exploration. Those who are still negotiating the exploration process, and in turn are not committed, are considered to be in moratorium. Persons who have committed to a particular identity, but who have not explored alternatives are in foreclosure status. Finally, adolescents who are not committed to a particular identity and are not engaged in exploration are said to be identity diffused (Marcia, 1988).\\n\\nWhile identity status reflects an individual\\x92s degree of exploration and commitment with respect to a particular identity, Berzonsky (1989; 1992a; 1992b; Berzonsky & Kulk, 2000) argued that the two dimensions have implications for how adolescents engage in coping and problem solving. In particular, Berzonsky identified three identity processing orientations that are defined by exploration and commitment: diffuse-avoidant, normative, and information. Individuals with a diffuse-avoidant orientation possess low levels of self-exploration and commitment; when faced with challenging situations, these individuals are reluctant to confront personal problems and often procrastinate making decisions. Adolescents who have a normative orientation possess high levels of commitment and low levels of self-exploration; those with this orientation tend to be closed-minded and focus primarily on the standards and expectations of significant others. Finally, individuals with an information orientation possess a high level of self-exploration and either high or low levels of commitment; these adolescents are introspective and actively seek out, process, and utilize self-relevant information.\\n\\nThe research reviewed suggests that adolescents may differentiated in terms of their identity status and identity processing style. As such, we believe that adolescents\\x92 varying degrees of self-identity development have implications for the types of goals that individuals pursue during identity-relevant events. Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation is to examine whether developmental differences in adolescents\\x92 self-identity development serve as an important explanatory mechanisms for the nature of adolescents\\x92 communicative intentions.\\nWhereas identity status is generally assumed to operate in all situations, Berzonsky (1992) conceptualized identity processing style as particualry relevant to problem-solving contexts. Therefore, we focused our investigation on a context where adolescents are likely to face identity-relevant problems: relational rule violations in their close, voluntary relationships. Situations involving violated expectations often constitute a threat to an individual\\x92s sense of self (Sheer & Weigold, 1995). Further, such situations typically provoke cognitive activity (Langer, 1978; cf. Roloff, Soule, & Carey, 2001) aimed at making sense of the issue. As such, when individuals engage in a rule-violating activity, they are driven to purse communicative goals in response to their behavior (Names Withheld, 1998).\\n\\nWe conducted two studies to examine the influence of identity status and identity processing style on adolescents\\x92 communicative goals for relational rule violations. In study 1, we sought to determine those communicative goals that were generated by adolescents after relational-rule violating situations. In study 2, we examined the influence of adolescents\\x92 identity status and identity processing style on the importance of the communicative goals identified in Study 1.\\n\\nStudy 1: Identifying Adolescents\\x92 Communicative Goals\\nMethod\\nTo determine the types of communicative intentions that adolescents\\x92 generate in response to relational rule violations, we first asked one hundred adolescents (age range: 16 to 19 years, M = 17.04, SD = 1.08). to describe something that they had done in their relationship that could be described as a relational rule violation. Next, adolescents were provided with a half page to describe their intentions for how they communicatively responded to their behavior; we used these intention descriptions as indicators of communication goals. After examining the set of communicative intention responses, we grouped equivalent descriptions together to form a list of forty nonredundant exemplars of goal statements.\\n\\nAnalysis and Results\\nUsing the forty exemplar goal statements, a sample of one hundred undergraduates performed a similarity-based sorting task. A data matrix was derived from the sorting results and was subjected to a hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique applying an average linkage between groups criteria. This analysis suggested the following eight clusters of communicative goals: (a) to be truthful, (b) to apologize, (c) to engage in restitution, (d) to maintain the relationship, (e) to terminate the relationship, (f) to manage partners\\x92 positive face, (g) to negatively focus on the partner, and (h) to avoid blame. We used these eight goal categories to develop a measure of communication goal importance that was utilized in Study 2.\\n\\nStudy 2: Linking Identity Status and Identity Processing Style to Communicative Goals\\nMethod\\nOur participants were one hundred and eighty adolescents who ranged in age from 14 to 19 years (M = 16.09, SD = 1.32). These adolescents completed a questionnaire that included measures of identity status and identity processing style. Then, similar to Study 1, respondents were asked to describe a relational rule violation with a close friend or a dating partner, and to describe what their communicative intentions were after the situation. Finally, respondents completed closed-ended measures of the communication goals derived from Study 1.\\n\\nMeasures. The thirty-two item Ego Identity Process Questionnaire (EIPQ; Balistreri, Busch-Rossnagel, & Geisinger, 1995) was used to measure the four categories of identity status. Respondents completed each item on a 6-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 6 = strongly agree). In line with Schwartz, Mullis, Waterman, and Dunham (2000), identity status assignments were formed by median splits. Adolescents who were deemed high on both exploration and commitment were considered to be in the Identity Achievement Status. Moratorium individuals scored high on exploration and low on commitment. Individuals who were low on exploration and high on commitment defined the foreclosed category. Finally, adolescents who were low on both dimensions were labeled as Identity Diffuse.\\n\\nBerzonsky\\x92s (1997) forty item Identity Style Inventory was used to assess three identity processing styles. Respondents completed items on a Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). To create a categorical measure of identity processing style, scores on the three styles were standardized and the style that received the highest score defined an adolescents\\x92 identity processing style (Berzonsky, 1989).\\n\\nWe created thirty-two items (four per goal) to measure the importance of the communicative goals for responses to relational rule violations. Using a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree), adolescents were asked to indicate the degree to which each of the eight goals identified in Study 1 were important concerns when responding to the relational rule violation that they reported. Given that goals can be singularly and simultaneously important (Names Withheld, 1999), we used this measure to determine the most important goal for each adolescent and to observe the operation of multiple important goals.\\n\\nAnalysis\\nThe data for Study 2 have been collected and have not been analyzed at this time. To examine the central association proposed in this paper, a factorial ANOVA will examine the influence of identity status and identity style on the importance of communicative goals. Additional analyses will examine potential covariates (e.g., age, gender, demographic characteristics).\\n\\nReferences\\nBalistreri, E., Busch-Rossnagel, N. A., & Geisinger, K. F. (1995).

A secondary purpose was to examine how intercultural communication apprehension (ICA) experienced by student sojourners in the U.S. was related to their SCAD in the host culture. The Kim¡¯s (2001) structure model of cross-cultural adaptation, a theoretical explanation of the multidimensional mechanism of the individuals¡¯ adaptation processes in a new and unfamiliar cultural environment, provided a theoretical basis for this study. The results of correlation analyses showed that 1) the amount of EI was not correlated with SCAD; 2) the increased amount of HI was correlated with decreased SCAD; 3) the increased proportion of EI to the total Internet use was related to increased SCAD; 4) increased ICA was related to increased SCAD; 5) increased ICA was related to the increased proportion of EI to the total Internet use. Finally, a regression analysis confirmed that both increased ICA and the increased proportion of EI significantly predicted increased SCAD. Overall, support was found for the structure model of cross-cultural adaptation.',\n",

Second, the concept of peripheral cues has been criticized for being ill-defined and ambiguous. This project addressed both of these issues in the context of the WWW. To test the hypotheses the author utilized a 2 (argument strength) x 2 (issue involvement) x 2 (peripheral cue complexity) factorial design. 120 college students read a Web site with some combination of the three factors. It was predicted that the degree of peripheral cue complexity (PCC) would increase persuasion among those not personally involved in the issue regardless of argument strength. Results indicate that the degree of PCC may increase attention paid to message content among those less personally involved, and may have encouraged the processing of argument strength.',\n",

One hundred sixty three Japanese white-collar workers in the Tokyo area participated in the research.

       "  'abstract': 'This paper examines the media frames the Belgian press is using to represent the issue of asylum, refugees and illegal immigration. Methodologically, the focus in this research lied on the question how these media frames can be detected in the press coverage. How can they sharply be defined independently of the interpretation of the researcher, since coming up with the names for frames itself involves a kind of framing? It was tried to go beyond notions of pro or con refugees, by using a specific framing approach. The media package approach as described by Gamson and Modigliani (1989) was used as a starting point. The extremities of the frame continuum which was operationalised were on the one hand \\x91asylum seekers are innocent victims\\x92 and on the other hand \\x91asylum seekers are profiteers and criminals\\x92. Subtle differences such as the use of metaphors and the choice of pictures were taken into account. These frames indeed did have the power to set the terms of the debate. Homogeneity analysis by HOMALS is introduced into framing research. It turned out to be a fruitful way the set the borders of the frames in the policy on immigration. The discovered frames seemed even to be ingrained in our language and culture.

Cognitive burdens have been shown to cause unrealistic events to be judged as more real.

This study investigates the disorientation that users may experience while using major newspaper and television news sites on the Web.

Study participants were placed in both interactive and noninteractive conditions on major news Web sites and answered questions that addressed the emotional and evaluative consequences of online content\\x97an understudied aspect of user experiences with Internet technology. While interactive conditions were rated significantly more participatory, involving, and immediate than noninteractive conditions, interactive tasks also generated significantly more confusion, disorientation, and frustration than a noninteractive reading task.

Though successful at bringing people closer to the news through features that invite involvement, online news operations are evidently leaving users who engage with interactive content somewhat confused. Disorientation in hypermedia environments is discussed not merely a nuisance problem but as a potentially serious issue affecting cognitive access to online content.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'TheInternet is becoming increasingly important as a tool used by social movements. It is used for a variety of purposes by these movements. The Website may be employed as a place to demonstrate the purposes of social movements. E-mail management lists may serve as a recruitment channel for membership in social movements. However, can actually be used to create a new form of social movement? This debate, therefore, raises fundamental issues for deliberating about the roles of information communication technology (ICT) in modern social movements.\\nIn terms of function of organizations, the study shows the virtual social movement is an information provider and a mobilization vehicle as well. Secondly, in the analysis of the purpose of action, the paper finds that the virtual movement is still combined with elements of traditional social movements. For instance, the declaration of alliance, means we should avoid overestimating the emancipating power of technology. Most importantly, the study indicates a new type of self-reflexivity emerging from such Internet-based social movements. In terms of the e-mail content, the virtual movement member uses a common language to implement the \\x93movement.\\x94 Apparently, the element of self-reflexivity should not be uniquely limited to the inflexible purpose of a movement group. Instead, the social boundary between public and private sphere in the virtual movement seems to be blurring.',\n",

Four prestigious newspapers; the WSJ, FT, NYT, and WP were selected to examine media performance.

This paper argues that media' abnormal calling attention to bad news with negative spin, lack of alternative views, and contexts free reporting all contributed to prompt herd-like behavior resulting in market collapses. Similar phenomenon repeated in followed financial crises in Russia, Brazil, and Argentine leads us to concern about the international financial information system.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study explores how international public relations professionals at firms identify themselves and what kind of roles they play. It also examines how they manage relationships with international clients and what are difficulties and problems in those relationships based on in-depth interviews. It is important to know what these practitioners think about their job because it eventually helps client organizations understand the relationship from a different perspective. Furthermore, despite their massive roles and functions, practitioners working at firms have not received much attention. In this study I try to provide an opportunity to listen to their voice.\\nThe findings show the participants identified themselves as consultants who contributed to more strategic tasks than technical services; however, they played both manager roles and technician roles with heavy focus on publicity. Meanwhile, the identity and position as consultants highly influenced the way they practiced as well as maintained relationships with clients. The professionals recognized the limit as outsiders; they were hardly involved in decision-making processes. In relationships with clients, they often followed whatever clients wanted to keep the relationship longer without losing the account. Although time differences and physical distances were some of the factors that made working with international clients harder, the key to the practice was maintaining good relationships with individual clients.\\nIt is suggested that client organizations be aware of the responsibility for public relations programs and tasks; clients need to be clear with their goals and objectives before they hire public relations firms. The kind of services, technical or managerial, depends on their own directions, guidelines, and expectation. Consequently, those who hire firms should keep in mind that they have responsibilities for the outcomes and develop smart ways of fully making use of public relations firms.',\n",

Exploiting a narrative interpretation of sensemaking in language as our point of departure, we illustrate, using empirical data drawn from a field study, how the meta-conversation is constituted. We show how it simultaneously admits and reconstructs the local conversations of the organization into an encompassing conversation, where the identity of the organization as a whole is being continually generated. The central process at work is the production of a meta-narrative that enfolds and transcends the narratives of individual members.',\n",

In this paper, we examine the discourses of the athletic male body as it is presented in the media discourses surrounding the NFL Draft. We focus specifically on the enumerative strategies used to define and delimit the bodies of football draftees.

However, we argue that the manner in which people manage conflicts can increase or decrease people's stress levels. Accordingly, this study examined how conflict management behaviors affected changes in self-reported stress. We hypothesized that cooperative conflict behaviors and competitive conflict behaviors differentially moderate the association between pre-conflict stress at post-conflict stress. Conjugal couples completed pre-test measures, engaged in a problem-solving task involving conflict topics that they nominated, and completed post-test measures. Regression analyses indicated that men's, but not women's, stress indicators were correlated. In addition, competitive (but not cooperative) conflict behaviors moderated the association between T1 stress and T2 stress. This study shows that competitive conflict behaviors interact with pre-conflict stress levels to affect post-conflict stress in a way that exacerbates stress. Cooperative conflict tactics had no influence on the association between pre-conflict stress and post-conflict stress. However, the relative amount of cooperative to competitive behaviors completely diminished the effects of pre-conflict stress on post-conflict stress.\",\n",

Drawing from recent work in science and technology studies, I contend that the shaping and diffusion of media artifacts are so intimately tied that they should be seen as the two sides of the same innovation coin. Using examples from the history of videotex newspapers in the United States, I show that actors simultaneously pursued interdependent technological and social transformations, that this was an ongoing process in which partial outcomes in the technological domain influenced social events at a later phase--and vice-versa--and that such process was influenced by historical developments.',\n",

The first prescribed silence on recent military achievements so as not to jeopardize ships that had carried out a successful action. The second guideline, which applied to military propaganda in general, required the hush-up of events that were likely to demoralize the home front.\\nWhen the German navy lost the auxiliary cruiser Thor during an accident that did not involve any enemy party, German propagandists decided not only to keep silent on the incident but also to pretend the Thor was still preying on Allied ships. In creating this myth they made extensive use of newsreel footage that had survived the Thor.\\nThe case study at hand, based on investigations into existing newsreel research, published archive documents, literature and personal contacts with former Thor crew members, elaborates a hitherto underexposed example of German military propaganda. It not only focuses on newsreel reports but also takes other communication media, notably German newspapers and radio (which both depended from the so-called Wehrmachtbericht), into account.',\n",

Jumpstart was initiated in 1995 to provides grants, consultation, and technical implementation to faculty interested in bringing new media into their instruction.\\nUsing Dutton's (1999) model of tele-access as a theoretical framework, and based on Web site analysis and interviews with CST staff and faculty participants, the paper considers whether and how the Jumpstart program achieved its goal of developing pedagogical innovations. Several themes emerge from the analysis of nine Jumpstart projects: increased tele-access to primary images and documents on the Web; a shift in pedagogy towards the visual and away from the verbal; a shift in student work from linear text to hyperlinked multimedia; and the asynchronicity of tele-access by the students to course information. The paper concludes that the innovations in the Jumpstart courses promote a shift from a passive to an active learning role for participating students.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Theorizing vision at the crossroads: The case of photography and digital imaging\\nIntroduction\\n\\nCommon expressions such as \"photographic vision\" or \"photographic memory\" suggest an individual\\x92s possession of a special quality for detecting or recognizing truth, non-distortion, or recall of details without will or effort. Photographic vision typically is associated with the photographer\\x92s special native talent for connecting expression to the mind\\x92s eye.\\nI argue in this paper that both highly advanced and novice practitioners of photography come to participate in the discourse of photographic vision by being socialized into photography as a domain of practice which 1) guides and inhibits a particular individuals use of the ideas, spaces, and materials and 2) provides a bounded space for challenges to these guiding standards.\\nIn an ethnographic study of a program in photography education, (1992-1995, ) I examined ways that photographic vision was cultivated through artifact mediated collective activities of definition, and how those definitions exhibit both old and new elements as the artifacts change. This argument, in the tradition of Howard Becker\\x92s (1982) book \\x93Art Worlds\\x94 positions photographic vision as a discourse, and questions several assumptions about vision as a particular form of skill defined in (bounded in?) and by the individual. I build on the discussion of the relationships between artifacts and vision outlined by Charles Keller and Janet Dixon Keller in their (1999) book on blacksmithing, and by Charles Goodwin and Marjorie Harnass Goodwin writing about \\x93Professional Vision\\x94 (1992).\\nI discuss particular kinds of photographic vision as cultivated among experts and novices learning \\x93classical\\x94 chemical darkroom photography methods in a university Visual Arts department. I compare this to the kind of vision invoked by a group pioneering the first courses offered in 1992 in the same department as digital imaging emerged as aa new way to work with photography\\nGoodwin and Goodwin\\x92s work on \"Professional Vision\" treats vision as mediated by discourse, and as situated activity. (1995, 7). Often, discussions of the role of artifacts and social contexts in shaping human experience of vision introduce data from settings that are explicitly tradition-oriented (Keller, Dixon) or where technological change is not a focal point of the analysis (Goodwin and Goodwin).\\nI discuss what happens to what the Goodwins call \\x93the discourses of a profession\\x94 when the artifacts supporting this discourse were changing dramatically. I asked how major technological change affected the acquisition or cultivation of particular norms of interpreting vision. I chose this research setting explicitly because a major issue for its members was the problem posed by the advent of new technologies for making photographic images.\\nKnocking on their studio doors were vendors, students and critics questioning the primacy and centrality of the department\\x92s curricular traditions, namely the central role of black and white, \\x93wet\\x94 (chemical, darkroom, analog) photography in the program. Questions about what was going to happen (is photography dying?) what decisions should be made, (should we convert our program to accommodate or emphasize digital imaging?) and how to think about new forms of practice in teaching and art making (how do you evaluate digital art?) were all around. I was interested particularly in the sorts of standards that would evolve for evaluating digital images, especially after I participated in a series of critiques of student work in black and white photography, and experienced the rituals and traditions of the \\x93arts crit\\x94.\\nStability and change in the routines of visual communication is an important theme on the borderland between photography and digital image making. My paper explores this theme with respect to photographic artists\\' relationships to vision when and where two radically different image making technologies come into play in the nteractions of a community of students and teachers accustomed to interacting around one well established medium and method.\\n\\nPartial Bibliography\\n\\nBecker, H.

This paper introduces explanations of recall of campaigns and of potential sources of bias in measurement. The explanations are tested in a secondary analysis of data from the evaluation of a domestic violence prevention campaign comparing the determinants of credible recall and a false exposure claim. In paired multivariate analyses, both false exposure and recall are associated with radio listening, domestic violence-related beliefs and behaviors, and racial identification. However, false exposure is also associated with respondent sex and education, interviewer race and Black newspaper reading. While the difficulty of assessing exposure to a campaign is confirmed by this analysis, the distinctions found between determinants of recall and response bias provide encouragement for teasing out further differences in future.',\n",

How do Japanese nationals perceive African-Americans given that their knowledge may be based solely on media contact? What factors play in the formation of these stereotypes?

The findings raise the question of possible other factors in stereotype formation, apart from pure exposure. Some form of selective retention, shaped by other external socio-cultural influences may play a significant part in shaping negative perceptions than previous quantitative studies account for. The pure focus on cultivation theory research of stereotype images needs to be complimented with other theories that examine the complexity of dealing with cross-cultural audiences.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Stunt doubles perform the vast majority of the action sequences in most adventure-oriented programs on television. While a character might be adored for her looks, her wit, or her intelligence, it is herbody, the body in action that that is the most beloved by many of the action hero\\x92s fans. But the media\\x92s coverage of the stars of these action programs, it is the star, not the double, who is celebrated as the strong, heroic performer.\\n\\nThe subtle erasure of the stunt double, or the downplaying of her role in the creation of the female action hero, is not unique. While the star is the primary actor in the role of the heroine, she does not necessarily play her in the moments of the program when the heroine is the most heroic. It is often the stunt double who animates the heroine, making her into the uniquely powerful woman that she is. What I wish to offer here is a study of the history of this simultaneous fascination with and erasure of the stunt double in the television production, within the text of these programs, with audiences through articles in the popular press, as well as with television scholars. While my point is not to cast blame, this analysis hopefully offers an examination of what virtually amounts to a unwritten conspiracy to negate the work of the stunt performer.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Because estimates of effects sizes are often either misreported or not reported at all, meta-analysts must use conversion formulas that allow them to estimate effect sizes from the information available in a research report. The focus of this article is on formulas that convert F in ANOVA to eta squared, d, or the correlation coefficient. This paper demonstrates that the traditional F to r formula can differentially, and in some cases radically, inflate estimates of effect size when combining the results from studies with varying numbers of factors. Specifically, commonly used conversion formulas for converting F values to r, actually yield a partial r statistic that can be substantially larger than the desired zero-order r depending upon the number and relevance of additional factors in ANOVA. An alternative method to calculate non-partialled effect sizes according to the common formula (SSeffect/SStotal) is provided.',\n",

A distinction is made between cues that provide information about the individual (personal identity cues) and cues that convey information about group membership (social identity cues). Results show that personal cues affect impression formation in that they reduce ambiguity. However, effects of personal cues on work satisfaction and subjective performance are moderated by social identity cues. Participants who are identified with a social group do not require personal cues when the partner is an ingroup member. High identifiers expressed perceiving a higher shared identity with an ingroup partner when personal cues were absent, and this could be the process underlying the results. Implications for the use of CMC in inter- and intra-group settings (organizational as well as private) are discussed.',\n",

A content analysis of four media--the Beijing Youth Daily, 21dnn.com, Phoenix Satellite TV, and sina.com--shows that communication channel has a significant main effect on media's degree of conformity while the ownership does not. Meanwhile, sina.com, a privately-owned on-line medium, was shown to be significantly more deviant from official Party ideology than the other three media. However, few news stories deviant from the Party line were found to challenge the government legitimacy above the municipal level.

This paper explores how far self-regulation can work generally, and particularly in cyberspace.\\nIt begins by looking at various modes of regulation, viz, market, technology, government legislation and self-regulation. It then explores the meaning of self-regulation as traditionally used and currently understood, or, as contended, misunderstood. A frequent misunderstanding is that self-regulation is self-control on the part of the individual when it is industry regulating industry. Effective self-regulation requires government legislation as a backstop, an approach once called self-regulation but now called co-regulation.\\nThe paper then draws upon examples in other industries to outline the conditions for successful self-regulation. Many of these conditions are absent from the internet currently. The paper concludes with some implications that should be noted when attempting to self-regulate aspects of the internet.

       "  'abstract': \"This study utilized a feminist perspective to examine how communication teachers talked about gender issues in their introductory communication classes and displayed gender equity and equality in their pedagogical practices. The two primary methods of data collection were in-depth interviews and participant observation. Participants were recruited from seven academic institutions located in midwestern communities. Fifteen in-depth interviews were conducted and three hours of classroom time were observed for each study participant. The following six themes emerged through the data analysis process: (1) historical traditions, (2) course standardization, (3) patriarchal language, (4) neutral positioning, (5) authority, and (6) technological prowess. These themes revealed how gender was marginalized and minimized in the talk and teaching practices of many of my research participants who instructed basic courses. Such marginalization may perpetuate disparities in the academic experiences of male and female students taking introductory communication courses. Even though the preservation of white patriarchy was common in many research participants' talk and teaching practices, data were reported from two critically reflective teachers who disrupted patriarchal ideologies in their basic courses and as a consequence achieved greater gender equity and equality.\",\n",

My aim with this study is to present scholars with an exemplar for conducting this type of micro-level critical discourse analysis. My analysis suggests that the meaning of certain key knowledge/truth constructs like \"discipline,\" \"company policy,\" \"consistency,\" and \"trust\" are not as fixed in the negotiation as they appear to be, but are communicatively negotiated between labor and management during the course of the collective bargaining. My interpretation therefore supports Foucault\\'s claim that power relationships are maintained, reinforced, or altered via discursive formations and suggests that a negotiation can truly be a negotiation over meaning (Putnam, van Hoeven, & Bullis, 1991). To conclude, I discuss my findings in light of previous research.',\n",

A review of communication-based literatures reveals that the building and sustaining of communities is perceived to be aided by an ethos of \"tolerance\" as applied social capital. The metaphor of \"communication as a borderland\" suggests, however, the weak character of this ethos. The melding that takes place in a borderland--the simultaneity of mixing, even as distinctions are held--better calls to mind an ethos of transcendence. This essay, then, will argue for supplanting \"tolerance\" with an ethic of \"transcendence\" in theorizations of community, civic communication, and public deliberation.',\n",

This study seeks to understand how media shape the presentation of issues at summit meetings by applying Lance Bennett\\x92s Indexing Hypothesis. The Indexing Hypothesis states that the press will include a range of voices in stories that mirrors or \\x93indexes\\x94 those voices in mainstream governmental debate. Alternative voices will appear in the press, Bennett explains, only in \\x93negative interpretative contexts.\\x94 While Bennett contends that this hypothesis only applies to \\x93everyday events,\\x94 this study questions whether a similar indexing pattern would appear at summit meetings \\x96 special events.\\nAs predicted, Bennett\\x92s Indexing Hypothesis explained only a portion of the press coverage of the summit. However, the study offers suggestions for a revision of the hypothesis to include \\x93special events,\\x94 which would predict a wider, but still limited range of voices in public debate.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pim Fortuyn became the party leader of a new party, Leefbaar Nederland, in November 2001. In February 2001 he was kicked out of the party because of his extreme opinions (\\x91The Islam is a backwards culture\\x92). He raised a new party, the LPF (Lijst Pim Fortuyn). In the opinion polls the new party rose fast. One and a half week before the elections of May 15th 2002 Fortuyn was murdered by an extreme vegetarian. Still the LPF gained 26 seats in the 150-seats Parliament, but the ChristianDemocrats did win even more. From a bare 30 seats in the polls they ended on 43 seats.\\nThis paper analyzes the news in the Netherlands in 5 newspapers and 3 television stations from the moment on Pim Fortuyn became the leader of Leefbaar Nederland. The news in each newspaper and in each television news program was assigned as a set of contextual variables to the readers of and the watchers of these particular media in an 8 wave panel survey. A network analysis of the news shows that the political position of the CDA was structural equivalent to the position of the LPF, albeit that the criticisms of the CDA on the government coalition were not as extreme. A LISREL-model of the effects of the news on party preferences on the respondents who read this specific news or watched this specific news shows that news on the \\x91own\\x92 issues of the various parties was important, as well as support from societal groups. The model shows also that the perceived performance of a party leader in the news was an important mediating variable to explain party preferences.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Propaganda posters played an instrumental role in the political history of the New China since 1949. The massive use of propaganda posters in political movements in China could be attributed to several prominent reasons. First, a significant proportion of Chinese populace had been illiterate or semi-illiterate. Visual communication rather than written documents may be the only successful means to reach them. Two, because of its distinctive audient immediacy, visual communication promises greater cognitive penetrability. Third, Chinese people have a long tradition of pictorial messages as manifested in the folk arts of Nianhua (New Year\\x92s Posters) and paper-cuts. Propaganda posters, therefore, are in conformity with Chinese people\\x92s cultural habits.\\n\\nWith the illustration of actual propaganda posters from different political periods in the New China\\x92s history, this work explains the instrumental role of such visual communication in political movements. This work also makes the contention that propaganda posters played a \\x93quasi-television\\x94 role in the pre-television age in China, and that, even today when television is pervasive, propaganda posters still play a role irreplaceable by television in China\\x92s political realm.',\n",

Data from 574 participants are used to assess perceptions of message, site, and sponsor credibility; to explore the extent and effects of verifying Web-based information; and to measure the relative influence of sponsor and design features. Results show that, for the most part, (news) media organization sites tend to be perceived to be more credible than electronic commerce sites and special interest group sites, which were viewed as more credible than personal Web sites. Findings also suggest that sponsor credibility may transfer from familiar entities to their Web sites, that site credibility can be achieved equally by familiar and unfamiliar sources, and that messages residing on sites may be viewed similarly in terms of their perceived credibility, regardless of the source that issues them. Contrary to expectations, a significant negative relation between self-report verification of site information and perceived credibility was discovered, indicating that reported verification does not match actual online behavior. These and other findings are discussed and several avenues for theoretical development of perceptions of Web credibility are presented.',\n",

This historical period marked India\\x92s transition from a state-led planned economy to its fuller integration into the global economic by 1991. I demonstrate how state-owned television as a commodity, as a medium, and as a new discourse of representation, played a significant role in transforming the ideologies of consumption and desire, rewriting gender and racial politics, and re-imagining the nation in ways that decisively departed from the postcolonial development agenda. Television was advertised through racially hybrid images that signified transnational masculine productive power and oriented desires towards westernization/ whiteness. The reception of the medium reflected anxieties that coalesced around westernization of national culture, gender modernization, and class conflict. These contradictions were partly resolved by constituting the \\x93consuming family\\x94 as the legitimate citizen-subjects of the televisual nation, excluding classes and communities on whose behalf television was first introduced in India.',\n",

Music and technology have been entwined in a close relationship for millennia. Yet in the communication literature the relationship between music and technology is ill defined. There is a disconnect between music research and theories of technological change. I argue that a social and cultural shaping of technology perspective can help bridge this gap. This perspective accentuates the social and cultural factors influencing technological change, and eschews both technological determinism and linear development models. For the history of the phonograph and early recording technology challenges the assumption that technology is predetermined from singular technologies, events, or actors. I will present an account of early Internet music technology based on primary historical research, which suggests that Internet music emerged from a confluence of disparate actors and events. These applications support the theoretical efficacy of the social and cultural shaping perspective for music and technology studies.',\n",

Also, it was found that their family played an important role in teaching them Korean language and Korean customs in the early period of identity construction. More importantly, Korean videos and mobile phone were the main media through which these Korean-Americans learned about Korean culture and society.

Yet, in Cultural Studies it is the same old new game\\x97 modernity must be churned under to make way for the new subject. Under the heading Late extra, Adorno writes,\\n\\x93The cult of the new, and thus the idea of modernity, is a rebellion against the fact that there is no longer anything new. The never-changing quality of machine-produced goods, the lattice of socialization that enmeshes and assimilates equally objects and the view of them, converts everything encountered into what always was, a fortuitous specimen of a species, the doppel-ganger of a model. The layer of unpremeditatedness, freedom from intentions, on which alone intentions flourish, seems consumed. Of it the idea of newness dreams. Itself unattainable, newness installs itself in the place of overthrown divinity amidst the first consciousness of the decay of experience. But its concept remains chained to that sickness, as its abstraction attests, impotently reaching for a receding concreteness. . . Today the appeal to newness, of no matter what kind, provided only that it is archaic enough, has become universal. . . Mankind, despairing of its reproduction, unconsciously projects its wish for survival into the chimera of the thing never known, but this resembles death. Such a chimera points to the downfall of an all-embracing constitution which virtually no longer needs its members.\\x94\\n\\nIn these terse lines Adorno expresses a desire to move beyond modernity\\x92s aporias, while at the same time recognizing that goal as unattainable. Contemporary cultural studies has tended to altogether dismiss such a goal and the conception of the subject upon which it is based. The critique of modernity and in particular the Cartesian cogito is presently the assumed jumping off place for cultural studies\\x92 notion of the subject. Predominantly, this involves accepting the so-called poststructuralist1 \\x93death of the subject\\x94, and concurrently the rejection of dialectics in favor of the immediacy of the particular and the dispersion of forces.\\nWhy bother with the \\x93subject\\x94? Because, how we conceive of the subject impacts the entire project of cultural studies: particularly, its conception of the limits of the present capitalist social formation and its strategies for social change and the support of freedom.\\nBut how has Cultural studies taken up the subject? I will first describe two counterpoised projects within cultural studies in regard to the \\x93subject\\x92: 1) a populist cultural studies approach which, although positing a fragmented subject with floating identities, nevertheless anchors this subject in an active agency. 2) a contemporary cultural studies approach which unhinges the subject even further in favor of the notion of pure multiplicity. I will then counter this with Theodore Adorno\\x92s approach to the subject which I claim avoids both alternatives: it neither accepts wholesale the active autonomous self, nor does it eliminate entirely the terrain of subjectivity.\\nI realize that I am carrying out a cultural heresy here, for it has by now become almost a requirement for every primer on cultural studies to contain a statement ridiculing Adorno and the Frankfurt School for their elitist, mandarin, modernist position which chastises the audience while monolithically positing a homogeneous deterministic mass media. Where Adorno is taken up it is to re-interpret aspects of his work in some poststructuralist guise, whether Derridian, Deleuzian, etc. It is the argument of this paper that Adorno is still valuable, not despite his \\x93modernism\\x94, nor because of some forced affinities with contemporary French theory, but precisely in and through his \\x93modernist\\x94 defense of the \\x93subject.\\x94\\nA. Cultural Studies: Two Approaches\\nI. Populist\\x97\\nThe work that I will describe as \\x93populist cultural studies\\x94 is a particular configuration of the cultural studies position that is part of a larger movement in audience study originally identified with John Fiske and others. This \"reading for resistance\" approach was ceremonially2 dismissed in the 90\\x92s, but the conceptions of audience, subject, resistance and play upon which it was based persist in the \\x93more sophisticated\\x94 versions that have followed. Within this approach, it is the \\x93knowledge\\x94 that the audience possesses that is at question, and so the \\x93discipline\\x94 constructs knowledge of a knowing subject (a subject that it, itself, has constructed). I will attempt to show how such a position mirrors empirical social psychology in constructing a particular kind of subject-- one invested in producing its own subjectivity.\\nBy employing a complex vocabulary of \\x93discursive positions,\\x94 \\x93multiple subjectivities,\\x94 \\x93nomadic agency,\\x94 \\x93articulations,\\x94 \\x93polysemic textuality, \\x93forms of empowerment,\\x94 and so on, cultural studies submerges its mirroring of the possessive individualism of liberal pluralism and the resulting rejection of Marxist class analysis.. But here, contradictions abound. Cultural studies, when emphasizing the multiplicity of subject positions that make class a secondary category, uses precisely the notion of the \\x93split subject\\x94; but when that subject becomes a popular audience member \\x93in activity,\\x94 all of a sudden, the subject is whole and self-reflective in a rather transparent way. One way of overcoming this contradiction is by shifting the focus from cognitive activity to \\x93affective\\x94 activity. I will attempt to show how this move simply replaces one side of the supposed modernist binaries (identity/difference) with the other.\\n\\nII. Poststructuralist Cultural Studies\\n\\nThe critique of the epistemic subject engendered by Marx (through Hegel) is rejected by poststructuralist cultural studies. For Marx, the spectator model of the self is replaced with the notion of the producing self that fabricates objectivity through its own historical activity. As Benhabib notes, Marx, \\x93sees the task of reflection neither as the withdrawal from the world nor as access to clarity and distinctness, but as the rendering conscious of those unconscious forces of history and society which have shaped the human psyche. Although generated by the subject, these forces necessarily escape its memory, control and conduct. The goal of reflection is emancipation from self-incurred bondage.\\x94\\nPoststructuralist Cultural Studies unhinges this mode of critique by replacing the reflective (the realm of consciousness) with the linguistic (the realm of language). Thus, the subject is replaced by a system of structures, oppositions and differences which are not viewed as products of a living subjectivity at all. Here we have the full \\x93death of the subject.\\x94 In this light, the various poststructuralisms from Foucault to Derrida have been instrumental in uncovering the forms of domination latent in Western culture\\x92s conception of self and other. For this, we can be thankful, but often the way this critique of the subject is carried out leads to a dead end, which I hope to show lies in a proto-metaphysics or ontology.\\nAt any rate, I will agree with Adorno, that the Subject that should be critiqued is not simply the subject of discourse, but the subject formed in relation to social historical conditions. So for Adorno, yes, the subject is enclosed by the objective, but he refuses to denounce subjectivity as inherently dominative. Yes, the historical conditions within which the subject has formed have led to a compulsive identity, but the way out is not through a simple renunciation of self-identity. As Dews points out, Adorno held that the undifferentiated state before the subject\\x92s formation was the dread of the blind web of nature, that if the subject is liquidated rather than sublated in a higher form, the effect would be regression.\\nPoststructuralist thought in taking the oppressive self-enclosure of consciousness to be the only possibility for subjectivity remains trapped in the philosophy of consciousness, for the only option is the chaotic affirmation of the diffuse and heterogeneous. Such dispersion of the self merely enacts what Adorno takes to be the central aspect of capitalist sociality\\x97the compulsive self is opened up only to be reinscribed in the indifference of the commodity form. The dispersed, transnational, flexible capitalism of the 21st century no longer needs a fixed subject, in fact, it needs a decentered one\\x97a \\x93subject\\x94 characterized by openness to ambiguity and the ability to carry out multiple individual projects in a mode of anti-collective, anti-sociality.\\n\\nADORNO\\nWhat is evident in Adorno\\x92s work is his constant critique of the self-standing subject and of the liberal pluralism upon which it is based. Adorno is in agreement with post-structuralism in his criticism of the illusory autonomy of the bourgeois subject. Adorno\\'s refusal to surrender subjectivity in the face of his strenuous critique of it distinguishes Adorno from poststructural theory and provides the basis for the continued relevance of his thought.\\nAs Zuidervaart attests, Adorno\\'s Theory is crucial in developing a critical understanding of the task of imagining the world differently, other than it is: \"There can be no horizon for dramatic historical change unless people can imagine and enact something other than the prevailing modes of reality and reason. And for such imagination and such enactment, there must be semblances of subjectivity.\\x94\\n\\nI will attempt to show that:\\nOne\\x97 Adorno\\x92s work avoids the irony of the poststructuralist approach, following Nietzsche, i.e., that it posits that the structures of knowledge are constitutive of the object, albeit falsely. It thus re-inscribes a kind of idealism. Adorno, attempts to avoid this, by retaining the subjective principle, while critiquing its historical form. As he says, \\x93we must use the force of the subject to break through the deception of constitutive subjectivity.\\x94\\nTwo\\x97 The poststructuralist ontology is one in which the contingent and the particular are immediate, and incapable of conceptualization. But for Adorno, this opposition of the chaotic to the conceptual is false\\x97pure singularity is itself an abstraction.\\n\\x93The opposition of the stable to the chaotic, and the domination of nature, would never have succeeded without an element of stability in the dominated, which would otherwise incessantly give the lie to the subject. Completely casting away that element and localizing it solely in the subject is no less hubris than absolutizing the schemata of the conceptual order\\x85 sheer chaos, to which reflective spirit downgrades the world for the sake of its own total power, is just as much a project of spirit as the cosmos it sets up as an object of reverence.\\x94 \\x96 Adorno, Negative Dialectics\\n\\nThus, what post-structuralism mistakes for immediacy is in fact highly mediated. Some recent cultural studies has adopted the poststructuralist dismissal of mediation, seeing it under the suspect Hegelian model of the synthesis of opposites. For Adorno, mediation never synthesizes contradictions, nor is it simply the way the self preserves its identity. Rather, where Adorno sees a contradiction there is already the identity of identity and non-identity. Mediation is not a transcendental operation or an act of self-enclosed consciousness, but as Jameson says \\x93it characterizes the way our spectatorship and our praxis alike construct portions of the world with a view to changing them.\\nFor Adorno, the experience of the contradiction of Hegel (in which the non-identical in the object is reduced to a reflection of the subject) sparks off a second reflection in which the non-identical is no longer viewed as the isolated particular, the particular is now seen as standing in a pattern of relations to other particulars, a historically sedimented constellation. Thus, for Adorno there is no permanent antagonism between conceptual thought and reality, the problem is that within present social relations the concept is given primacy.\\nThree\\x97 Ultimately, Adorno wants to reconceptualize the subject as capable of acknowledging its own moment of non-identity. Poststructualism, on the other hand, in rejecting any reflective consciousness, sees the ego or self as only capable of exclusion, thus, the only option is to reject this supposed unity of self-consciousness in favor of a dispersal of intensities, a metaphysics of desiring machines, or the indifference of boundless flux. Adorno, like the poststructuralists, sees the failure of modernity in its denial of the body, the sensuous and material existence, but for Adorno the mere affirmation of these non-identical others is no solution.\\nFor Adorno, compulsive identity must be historically situated and treated dialectically. Despite the domination that it engenders, it was necessary (as a form of self-preservation) in order for human beings to liberate themselves from blind subjection to nature. To this extent such identity contains a moment of freedom. There is a necessary interdependence of identity and non-identity in the constitution of the self. Subjectivity is a problem of social relations\\x97\\x93the relation to the other is constitutive of subjectivity.\\x94 The problem with the poststructuralist subject is that it is so entirely dehistoricized that it cannot be called upon to take up a role in the context of revolutionary agency. The roots of this lie in the Nietzschian destruction of any relation between interest, agency and knowledge.\\nFour\\x97 And so Adorno\\x92s critical theory is the antithesis of postmodernism and poststructuralism, for he calls for the intensification of self-reflection and reflective questioning. The unitary, controlling subject can be overcome only through subjectivization, not through its limiting. Adorno\\x92s negative dialectics is the conduct of self-suspending thought, it is \\x93the self-consciousness of the objective context of delusion; it does not mean to have escaped that context.\\x94 In this section, I will detail Adorno\\x92s critique of identity thinking.\\nFurther, for Adorno, the subject-object relation cannot be eliminated, it can only be reconfigured. Adorno\\x92s tack in this regard is to give predominance to the object. The subject does not constitute the object, yet subject and object do mediate each other. A reconciliation of subject-object would involve, as Adorno says: \\x93Neither the undistinguished unity of subject and object nor their antithetical hostility. In its proper place, even epistemologically, the relationship of subject and object would lie in the realization of peace among humans as well as between humans and their other. Peace is the state of distinctness without domination, with the distinct participating in each other.\\x94 Thus, Adorno\\x92s conception of subjectivity is what Martin Jay calls a three-starred constellation: collective subjectivity, individual subjectivity and the objective world each take up their rightful place in a dialectic of mutually supportive non-identity. So, it is the restoration of difference and non-identity to their proper place in the non-hierarchical constellation of subjective and objective forces that he called Peace.\\nFive\\x97 Adorno sees identity thinking as reflecting a social situation in which mental labor is effectively split from manual labor ( a relation which I plan to relate to current conceptions of information labor and cyberspace). When Adorno speaks of the priority of the object he is referring to the body, to the relations with others and to the material configurations of exchange and class. Adorno refers to a \\x93rational identity\\x94 of the subject, by which he means 1)consciousness of the non-identical and 2) solidarity (through reflective memory) with those who have suffered. But Adorno would further claim that any utopian reconciliation would require first or rather simultaneously a dismantling of the social formation that has constructed the antagonism between subject and object. Adorno opens the possibility for another form of subjectivity, one that does not yet fully exist as a collective habit because the concrete form of social life to which it corresponds has not yet come into being.\\n\\n\\n\\x93The need to lend a voice to suffering is a condition of truth.\\x94 --Adorno\\n\\n\\n1 I hesitate to characterize contemporary theory rooted in the work of Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, Lyotard, Butler, etc. as poststructuralist, because most of these theorists disclaim the term. However, within cultural studies as it exists within communication, poststructuralism is used to characterize the bulk of this work. Therefore I will use the term under this qualification.\\n2 I mean \\x93ceremonially\\x94 in the sense that this was carried out in ritual form at specific occasions formally conceived as defining the field of cultural studies.',\n",

Results show that written forms that create general truths out of individual experiences help both to create a space for organizational change to occur and to create the change as an object to be distributed and consumed by organizational members. Writing down weaknesses opened a space for the team to refer to in later meetings as topics for change. Changes later discussed were themselves textualized in written form.

Findings from a host of prior cross-cultural studies suggest that those of differing cultural orientations are likely to possess differing motivations for deceiving and truthtelling, and as a consequence, are likely to exhibit differing perceptions toward deceptive and truthful messages. To test the proposed theoretical relationships, participants (N=240) were solicited from the United States (n=120) and Japan (n=120) to rate the transcribed verbal content of both deceptive and truthful messages generated by both American and Japanese subjects in a prior cross-cultural study of deceptive behavior. All participants were instructed to review and evaluate two out of a total of 40 transcribed dyadic interactions that were recorded as part of an earlier cross-cultural experiment investigating nonverbal behaviors under deception. For both transcripts reviewed, participants rated the verbal content of each transcript along the dimensions of: politeness, friendliness, formality, conventionality, and directness. They were also asked to rate their perceptions of the favorableness and deceptiveness of the verbal contents of each transcript.

       "  'abstract': 'According to the situational theory of publics (J. E. Grunig, 1997), practitioners can identify their most strategic constituencies by identifying publics who are most likely to influence their organizations and publics who their organizations\\x92 actions will affect. Some publics are too constrained to participate in activism, however. In this paper, we examine the use of community-based interventions (CBIs) to build community infrastructure in regions where severely constrained publics reside. This strategy could result in reducing the number of severely constrained publics and increasing the amount of activism. In turn, increased activism drives organizations toward the Excellence model of public relations (L. A. Grunig, 1992). Planning CBIs therefore benefits severely constrained publics as well as the practice of public relations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Simply stated, image-induction posits that one can manipulate a person¡¯s self-image in order to gain compliance. Because source-suggested self-images work to create a desire to behave in accordance with a particular view of one¡¯s self, influencing a person¡¯s self-perception through suggestion enables persuaders to achieve increased compliance with requests associated with receiver¡¯s salient self-images.\\nBy testing image-induction under various conditions (using non-pro-social requests; effects of face-to-face implementation vs. non-interpersonal text-based implementation; and changes in constructs from a willingness to try to new things to helpfulness) this study attempted to better understand the relationship between the use of image-induction and subsequent increases in compliance.\\nThe results clearly indicate that the addition of an image-inducing question is associated with increased rates of compliance when compared to a control group. This trend was most noticeable among subjects in the interview portion of the experiment where it was theorized public commitment to the initial question would produce a stronger drive towards compliance. The theory also held true for the non-interpersonal text-based portion of the experiment. Subjects who were asked to comply with a request did so less often than those who received an image-inducing question prior to the request. Subjects not given the image-inducing question tended to comply with similar rates of acquiescence regardless of the construct (helpfulness or willingness to try new things) or format (interview or non-interpersonal text-based). The addition of an image-inducing question in the interview portion of the experiment tended to gain similar rates of compliance without regard to theoretical construct. The same was true for the non-interpersonal text-based version of the image-inducing constructs. Using the image-induction strategy was demonstrated to be more effective however in the interview portion of the experiment.',\n",

A letter was then dropped and the person whose birthday was closest to the date of the mail drop was invited to participate in the online survey. A prize of S$500 (US$285) was given to a lucky respondent. The findings were then compared with the 4th IT Household Survey, which had been conducted earlier. Key demographic findings in the present survey matched that in the earlier survey. This suggests that the method was effective as a means to conduct a valid online survey. Besides the faster turnaround time through bypassing the keying in of raw data, the online survey also cost a third of what it would have cost had a similar survey been done face-to-face.

The paper attends particularly to the role of gender in shaping understandings of an Orientalist East, tracing patterns of imagery from the colonial era to their continued impact in the contemporary era. By attending to gender and history, the paper outlines a visual vocabulary through which the East has conventionally been pictured.\\n\\nThe media theorist John Hartley (1996) claims that \"journalism is the most important textual system in the world\\x94 because, beyond providing information, it leads us to understand the world in particular ways. Significantly, despite the international reach of media organizations, the media still creates a sense of belonging drawn on national lines. Hartley argues that the media provide a \"national, political fantasy\", and through it, a sense of community. Reading the media of different countries allows one to see who is inside and who is outside of these \\x91fantasized\\x92 communities. Gender provides a crucial category and method of analysis of such mediated \\x91fantasies\\x92.\\n\\nBecause media representations calibrate gaps and emphases in public debates, they carry enormous power, especially during moments of social stress and conflict.

The data for this study focuses upon the accounts of telecommunications professionals concerning their experiences in the new economy, within multiple telecommunications organizations, and within an educational program. This study then, first contributes to previous understandings of the technical professional identity. A second contribution to theory emerges as these accounts reveal an interdependence of the rules, resources, and routines of professional identity structure. The routines participants described in their work processes and in continuing their education are meaningful for individuals in terms of their ontological security; routines are the means through which professionals prepare for and secure their future role as a professional. This work extends understandings of both identity as a structure (Scott, Corman, and Cheney, 1998) and how knowledge directly connects to the identity structure.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Beginning with a powerful statement offered by Tim Berners-Lee, this paper defines the issues of Internet accessibility and usability pertinent to individuals with disabilities. With over 54 million individuals in the United States suffering with disabilities, focus and priority must be given to ensure that computer and Internet accessibility are ubiquitous. This paper is based upon three premises, the first of which states that access to a computer does not indicate accessibility for the disabled. Significant difference exists between access and accessibility. The second premise states that access to a computer does not mean access to the Internet. Even when an individual obtains accessible usage of a personal computer, several issues arise when he/she is faced with the issue of connectivity. Persons with a disability are only half as likely to have Internet access either from home or some other location than those without any disability. The final and most crucial aspect of this paper is website accessibility. Premise three states that access to the Internet does not by any means imply effective usage of the content by individuals with disabilities. Through a simple content analysis on various Websites, it becomes apparent just how much change must take place in order for the disabled to effectively utilize the Internet.',\n",

This framework is then used to organize scale items-pulled from existing measures as well as generated specifically for this effort-for potential inclusion in a C-OI measure.

TPM power is conceptualized as a three-dimensional phenomenon, with technical, political, and voting powers as its co-dimensions. Based on existing literatures and personal observation, the author discusses three key networks of active stakeholders (the technologists, the government, and the activists), as well as twelve propositions that describe nine power resources (technical credibility, moral authority, communication competence, and etc.) in relations to TPM power and its co-dimensions. A three-dimensional visual model and a mathematical equation are also included to describe TPM power. The author concludes that future technological infrastructure will be shaped by networks of stakeholders who can successfully manipulate power resources to influence policy outcomes.',\n",

The processes associated with making attributions about one's own messages and the messages communicated by others are explored. We sought to validate an underlying assumption of attribution processes -- that message making is a common form of human behavior, therefore, we should attribute messages to ourselves and others as a part of making sense out of our interpersonal interactions and relationships, regardless of whether or not those messages were actually communicated during an exchange. Participants completed surveys after a conflict with either a friend or romantic relationship partner that included both scales measuring power, interdependence and satisfaction, and open-ended questions about their perceptions of the conflict and the message strategies enacted by both themselves and their partner. The responses were coded using a typology of compliance-gaining strategies. Results indicate a large degree of consistency in the responses of participants, and that emotional reactions to the conflict are overwhelmingly negative. However, the results also suggest that conflict participants are able to make message-based attributions about their partner's behavior during the conflict as well as their own.\",\n",

The authors argue that rethinking the limits and potential of media ethnography to address cultural consumption also necessarily involves considering how ethnography can serve to engage and engender a vision of international communication theory grounded in the practices of everyday life. This reconceptualization of international communication is crucial at a time when some media scholars celebrate difference via micro assessments of postcolonial locales and the plurality of cultures without attempting to consider global structural concerns. In fact, thus authors argue, if media ethnographies are rigorously developed they can offer international communication theory with the material to bridge the gap between meaning and structure without losing site of the complexity, context and inherent power imbalances of cultural consumption.',\n",

Moreover, the perspective of cross-cultural psychology is adopted with emphasis on individualistic and collectivistic cultural syndromes, for further understanding cultural factors contributing to conflict resolution.

       "  'abstract': 'Through the content analyses of news coverage, seven unsuccessful conflict resolution cases provides a natural history of the use of the contingency theory in public relations. The content analysis tracked the changing stances of five profit organizations (Enron, Napster, Philip Morris, McDonalds, Monsanto) and two non-profit institutions (Boy Scouts, Catholic Church) moving on the continuum from pure advocacy to pure accommodation, in response to a number of contingent factors that can just as readily move an organization toward accommodation as toward advocacy. Employing conflict and conflict resolution models from the conflict studies literature to advance the contingency theory in public relations, results confirm that perspectives of an organization and its public change over time. Both an organization and its public in each conflict demonstrated overall \\x93advocacy,\\x94 but non-profit institutions and the public showed more neutral stance than profit organizations and the public. Both parties employed \\x93contending\\x94 strategy dominantly during the conflict management process, but the aspect was less obvious for non-profit organizations and the public than profit institutions and the public. The news frame for the changing aspects over time were associated predominantly by the contingent factors, external threats, industrial environment, organization\\x92s characteristics and issues.',\n",

Since the early days of television, congressional committees have periodically held hearings on television violence and what can be done about it. However, it took nearly forty years for legislation dealing with television violence to be enacted into law. Further, the laws that have been enacted do not appear to have been particularly effective in achieving their intended purposes.\\nWhy has all the interest and activity in regards to television violence achieved so little in terms of results? The incremental model of policymaking provides a possible explanation. That model predicts that most policy changes are likely to be small, and offers reasons for why this might be so. This paper applies the incremental model to congressional policymaking on television violence to answer the question posed above.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Much of the discussion that surrounded the question of the veil in France, following the 1989 in-famous \\x91affaire du foulard\\x94, has been couched in terms of restricting binaries: secularism-Islam; Us-Them; East-West. There have been few attempts to look at the resurgence of the veil among Muslim schoolgirls in French public schools outside of the politicized discourse of \\x91Islam is reversing the colonizing process\\x92. There has been only sporadic reflection on the significance of dress, and other bodily markers, in the contestation and re-negotiation of group identities within conflicting cultural spaces. Rather, the predominant discourse, which is consistent with the Orientalist mystique of the Orient as the \\x91Other\\x92, has revolved around the threat Islam and its dress code pose to the cultural integrity of French society.\\nThe underlying premise behind such a parochial interpretation is the notion of identity as a bounded, already completed entity. This is mainly due to the limiting political discourse that has surrounded the veil affair ever since it was made public. Following Stuart Hall\\x92s argument that identities are contextual and relational positionings which are never fixed but always \\x91in process\\x92, I argue that the young women\\x92s decision to wear the veil should not be viewed, exclusively, as a religious statement with an intent to subvert the status quo in French society. Dress is an important marker of difference, and highlighting one\\x92s religious, cultural, or social difference is expected in a context of marginalization and racism. In this paper, I will probe the cultural specifics as well as the political complexities that form the background of this affair.',\n",

This content analysis revisits its study in the general election of 2000 when public journalism has had a decade to develop, and also examines it from the perspective of photography and graphic design. This study found that public journalism in newspapers used more graphic elements to convey issues and analysis, common ground and solutions, and to present information that citizens can use to contact the media than did traditional journalism. But it did not translate mobilizing information or views of citizens into graphic form more frequently than non-public journalism stories, nor did it use more photographs of citizens than candidates, officials, and experts.',\n",

However the paper argues that public relations COULD be made a legitimate and surprisingly important academic discipline through a deeper understanding of notions of rhetoric than that given by Robert Heath (Heath. 2001). In the post modern era, scientism, progressivism, grand-narration, in fact all the other pointers to thinking and philosophy, are coming adrift from their foundations for most western people. One consequence of this fragmentation of perspectives, this loss of religiosity or faith in progress and the modern, is that the academic \\x91market\\x92- as we might call it, has a new opening for a subject which specialises in understanding frameworks for thinking in the post modern age. Public relations activity fills this role in a similar way to the way rhetoric filled this role for the ancients.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'As more interpersonal interactions move online, people increasingly get to know and recognize one another by their self-selected identifiers called usernames. Early research predicted that the lack of cues would make primitive categories such as biological sex irrelevant in computer-mediated interactions. Little is known about the types of perceptions people make about one another based on this information, but research has shown that questions about gender are the first to be asked in online interactions and sex categorization has maintained salience. The current project was designed to examine the extent to which individuals might include obvious gender information in their usernames, as well as how easily gender could be attributed from usernames. Seventy-five coders were asked whether or not they could assign 298 people to a sex category based only on their username, and then to rate how confident they were in making the attribution. Results indicated that coders were fairly inaccurate in making these attributions, but moderately confident. Additionally, the results indicated that neither women nor men were more accurate in attributing gender from usernames, and that neither women nor men tended to use more obvious gender markers in their usernames. Additionally, those who did use obvious gender markers in their username tended to have less experience with computer chat. The results are discussed in conjunction with the limitations of the present investigation, and possibilities for future research.',\n",

Contrary to an anticompetitive explanation for carriage denials, the logit analysis found that vertical integration in the cable industry did not have a significantly negative effect on cable system carriage of local stations, holding other factors constant. Other results from the study indicate that stations more likely to be denied carriage by cable systems were those with lower viewing shares, young, independent and originating from a distance. While the studies raised concerns about the negative impact of non-carriage instances on small independent stations and in smaller markets, the findings generally support the notion that cable¡¯s local station carriage decisions were more a result of efficient than anti-competitive motives.',\n",

A coding form included macro-structure or summary (headings, opening paragraph); microstructure (context, verbal reactions, expectations, conclusions and consequences; and iconography); and the objective social construction of reality, which included tipifications, roles, and sedimentation and traditions.\\n\\nResults indicate that Colombia\\x92s armed conflict is part of the daily discourse of the country; also, a thinning of the borderline between news genres is found, which has an impact upon the coverage of the conflict. New actors of the conflict emerge in the news discourse, whom are either more visible (i.e., guerrilla groups) or more invisible (civil society), and while there is talk about coverage of the peace process, discourse focuses more heavily on violence. Authors formulate a model for journalistic coverage of armed conflict by integrating the theoretical concepts used in the study due to the lack of contextual orientation for readers found in the discourse. The authors end their analysis with a proposed agenda for future studies of the Colombia\\x92s armed conflict.',\n",

Numerous media outlets within the areas of primetime television, newspapers, newsmagazines, and television newscasts are analyzed separately as well as compared in determining how much violence and what types of violence each has included over the past two decades. Results find that the media types vary in terms of percentage of overall content that contains violence as well as number of physical and verbal violent acts. The media types are also found to differ in terms of longitudinal trends. For some, amount of violence has increased over time, whereas for others it has decreased. Finally, comparisons are drawn between the amount of violence in the media examined and external factors, namely amount of governmental and press attention to the issue of media violence as a social problem and FBI crime data. Scant evidence of a relationship between presence of violence in fictional and non-fictional media and these factors is found.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Theory and research on media violence provides evidence both that aggressive youth seek out media violence (selective exposure) and that media violence prospectively predicts aggression in youth. We argue that both relationships, when modeled over time, should be mutually reinforcing, in what we call a negative feedback-loop model. The present study uses structural equation models to analyze two sets of cross-lagged relationships between these variables, each measured approximately eight months apart in panel data. The measure of use of media violence included viewing action films, playing violent computer and video games, and visiting violence-oriented Internet sites by students from six middle schools in three districts from three different regions in the U.S. Chi-square difference tests indicated that violent media content use was prospectively predicted by aggressiveness after controlling for baseline scores and demographic control variables, and that in turn aggressiveness was prospectively predicted by violent media content use after controlling for selective exposure as well as baseline and demographic control variables. The path coefficients were significant for the hypothesized relationships in all but one of the selective-exposure links. The findings appear largely consistent with the proposed negative feedback-loop model. The implications of this model for theorizing about media effects on youth, and for bridging active audience with traditional media effects perspectives, are discussed.',\n",

They believed it could provide a forum for voices which were usually ignored by the settler-oriented mainstream press. They thought it would encourage self-reliance among a people whose self-worth was denied by the colonial institutions and people who governed them. They envisioned it creating a sense of community, and the nationalists did believe the press could raise political consciousness by giving voice to the complaints about and criticisms of the colonial government. Ultimately, they believed that the press should provide a nonviolent means of resistance to the colonial government.',\n",

This comparison study examined the visuals of US and Chinese Television commercials by introducing the perspectives of the high-context and low-context cultures as well as individualistic and collectivistic societies and see how visuals manifested themselves in three sets of variables: story-telling, emotion and culture indicators. Results indicated that visuals were indeed cultural vehicles of the societies in which they were created. But the values manifested in them might not be as simple as we first understood.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The current study explores the connections between communication, agency, voice, and engagement in diverse workplace communities by investigating the perceptions held by members of traditionally muted groups about negative jobs they have experienced. Based on the existing literature, individuals from diverse backgrounds (N = 28) were interviewed about their experience in workplace communities. Four types of narratives about jobs were found based on the participants\\x92 sense of voice, agency, and engagement. Two types of negative jobs focused on the organizational systems, while the other two centered on the struggle for voice in relationships. Informal voice and voice with peers as well as supervisors were important to participants. Perceptions of voice in the workplace were important for giving participants a sense of agency or control over their environment. In addition, the participants linked their perception of voice to engagement in their work and workplace relationships. The current project makes a unique contribution by (a) including diverse perspectives not heard before in the research regarding the workplace; (b) extending muted-group theory to better address the communication of people from muted groups in diverse communities; and (c) providing research results that have the potential to be useful both to individuals and organizations.',\n",

The proposed explanation for this finding is the role played by media during periods of intense social incandescence. During and since the 1965 events media coverage has used Watts as shorthand for the racial problems of the city. Greater fear of Watts in the maps of those who rely heavier on television for social and personal orientation provides support for this proposition.',\n",

The degree to which CDD members identified with CDD and PDA members identified with PDA was assessed by using the Organiational Identification Questionnaire (OIQ) constructed by Cheney (1982). Comparison of PDA and CDD scores on the OIQ provided findings that mirror those of previous studies of organizational identification. Specifically, the level of organizational identification among those employees who work for the privately-run social cause organiation was significantly higher than was true of the employees who work for the government organization. Thus, the private organization appears to be more effective than the government organization in successfully fostering employee identification. However, while factor analysis of the OIQ revealed three dimensions, they were not the three dimensions theorized by Cheney. Instead, within the context of Thailand, the dimensions describing organizational identification appear to reflect: Pride in Membership (life values), Fit with the Organization (social values), and Comfort Zone (personal values).',\n",

Starting out as a show focused on the \\x91man on the street,\\' Vox Pop, according to its creator Parks Johnson, consecutively developed into a quiz show, an interview show, and a talk show. While quiz shows do relate to \"everyday genres\" (Bakhtin, 1981) such as parlor games and interviews, they are not clearly defined through established industry practices or audience expectations. The case of early radio quiz shows in the 1930s suggests that genre might be better theorized as a system of fundamental hybridity and arbitrariness. As Derrida (1992) points out, genres as classificatory systems are ever present, but tend to be invoked in a contradictory manner in everyday practice. The instability of genre definitions in early broadcasting therefore does not just speak to a general sense of confusion in the industry, but to the multiple generic affiliations of any given program.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The August 2002 issue of Communication Theory (an ICA journal) recognizes the importance and relevance of the term \\'Postcolonial\\' in contemporary analysis of culture and politics. A raging definitional debate in various disciplines about Postcolonial theory and the term Postcolonial has continued for some time. Shome and Hegde\\'s introductory article in Communication Theory outlines the possible connections between Postcolonial and Communication theory. In such an effort, they interview Gayatri Spivak as a prominent Postcolonial and feminist thinker whose scholarship they write, \"...has significantly shaped the course of postcolonial thinking and has had profound impact on conceptualizing issues of culture, identity, communication, and transnationalism.\" In this paper, I hope to provide a brief critique of Spivak. I also provide an outline of what Poonam Pillai and others have termed as \"Indigenous theory\" and its relevance to Postcolonial theory, an area of study marginalized both by Spivak and others. At the core of this critique is the unspoken assumption of \"West as Theory, East as Evidence.\" My primary aim is to examine the ways in which metropolitan and Postcolonial theories (such as Spivak\\'s), which apparently critique colonialism and imperialism, themselves participate in perpetuating Western cultural imperialism.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study examined the relationship between interactive attributes and the consumer browsing behavior at e-commerce websites based on the two contending theoretical frameworks: uses and gratification theory and social cognitive theory. While the former assumes that consumers are rational and try to minimize their search and transaction costs through online shopping, the latter relaxes the assumption of rational consumers arguing that consumers can be impulsive from deficient self-regulation. From the empirical study of the top 65 e-commerce websites, this study found out that interactive attributes supporting each of the two contending theoretical perspectives coexist at e-commerce sites: some attributes promoting rational consumer¡¯s efficient shopping activity and the others enticing impulsive consumer¡¯s inefficient browsing behavior. Even among the competing interactive attributes with the opposite directional influences, the sensory stimulus (the picture size of the products) turned out to be the most influential attribute for making e-commerce websites sticky by attracting and holding consumers in the websites.',\n",

They are arguing that law enforcement agencies are \"losing control.\" Without enhanced surveillance powers, the argument runs, drug trafficking organizations and other illicit businesses will be able to use telecommunications technologies with impunity and anonymity. The problem with this narrative is that it functions to narrow the scope of policy analysis by obscuring the ways in which developments in criminal justice policy and associated changes in the US State have fuelled money laundering and law enforcement\\x92s response to it. Indeed, the narrative also masks the fact that the US State has contributed to some of the very problems (e.g., drug trafficking) anti-money laundering initiatives are supposed to address. An alternative narrative is sketched, one that places the US State at the center of analysis. Specifically, it is argued that the escalation of the US State\\x92s failed War on Drugs has been a key factor driving the money-laundering problem. The question of the influence of the \"telecommunications revolution\" on money laundering and drug trafficking must be considered within this broader political context.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study examines how motivations to use the media in a political domain interact with demographic variables. The motives to use political media flow from uses and gratification theory, while the examination of how these motives interact with demographics flows from knowledge gap theory. Three motive dimensions\\x97surveillance, social interaction, and diversion\\x97were identified from data from a 2000 telephone. Social interaction reduced the voting gap created by race, the consumption of political coverage gap created by age, and the interpersonal communication gap created by length of residence in a community, while it increased the education gap for voting. Surveillance increased the education gap for interpersonal communication. After the effects of demographic were removed, media-use motives still predicted voting, news media consumption, interest in politics, and interpersonal communication. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of media-use motivations in understanding how demographics create differential levels of political activity.',\n",

The photographs, profiles, quotations, and citations of six current edition textbooks were examined using content analysis to determine the inclusion of women. Findings suggest that women are not represented in introductory public relations textbooks at the percentages at which they represent the field. For example, women were identified sources for quotes only 91f the time, and were identifiable citation sources only 101003410535f the time. In addition, women were not the sole subject of the majority of photographs included in textbook chapters. These results suggest that the contributions and importance of women to public relations may not be covered in as much detail as would seem justified since the field is a feminized practice.',\n",

The case studies and content analysis of print coverage of these controversies suggest that scholars should pay greater attention to how media response to investigative reporting can influence its ability to act as a watchdog on power and provide a diverse marketplace of ideas. In both cases, corporate targets of investigative reporting used litigation and public relations to divert media attention from muckrakers' charges against targets to questions of newsgathering ethics. Ironically, we find that the more that news organizations under attack defend their right to muckrake, the more they risk the rest of the news media burying the disputed story under discussion of First Amendment rights and media ethics. In addition, the print response studied here did not offer much diversity of viewpoint on these controversies, privileging the views of corporate targets over victims and their advocates.\",\n",

The findings suggest several reasons why viewers were interested in and exposed themselves to tragic news, including concern about the victims, the desire to remain informed (which may have provided a psychological sense of control), the inclination to monitor the environment for threat cues in stressful situations, the desire for reassuring information, the need to bond with others in a similar emotional state, interest in tragic events (i.e., morbid curiosity), and the meta-emotional tendency to enjoy the experience of sadness.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This paper offers new evidence on the beginnings of mass communication study in the U.S., suggesting that the earliest communication programs were short-lived interdisciplinary committees at the University of Chicago which were at the forefront of an emerging field, but died an early death from lack of institutional support. Drawing on archival research and interviews, the paper suggests that the roots of communication study, as separate from professional journalism training and the study of rhetoric, goes further back than previously assumed. The paper seeks to explain why the Chicago programs, which involved famous scholars who are widely credited as pioneers of communication research, are unknown in our discipline's history, and what that tells us about academic institutions in general, and mass communication research in particular.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'New and advanced technologies enable firms to collect, use, disseminate, disclose, and sell Internet users¡¦ personal information. Privacy concerns are thus revealed. Self-regulation is preferred by the government and the industry. This research applies the analysis of the traditional media¡¦s self-regulatory efforts to predict if self-regulation works in the Internet. Unfortunately, the Internet does not provide circumstances for a successful self-regulation regime. First, Internet industry members do not have strong incentives to comply with privacy principles. The only means to encourage industry members to take action to self-regulate their privacy practices may be threats of government legislation. Nevertheless, the government believes that the industry has the ability to self-regulate and therefore takes a hands-off stand. Second, it is noticeable that the enormous size of the Internet across nations will make the enforcement difficult. Third, funding of self-regulatory organizations is a problem. Fourth, enforcement mechanism and power are not effective in encouraging compliance of members. Finally, public participation in the Internet¡¦s self-regulatory efforts is problematic. In sum, legislation is necessary to ensure the industry¡¦s consistent and persistent commitment to fair information practices and their compliance. This paper attempts to assist policy observation and policy making by evaluating policy proposals, analyzing conflicts, and identifying the best ways to deal with online privacy controversies in light of the revealed social conditions and Internet characteristics.',\n",

       "  'paper_type': 'Paper',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'As an emerging field of popular culture, Japanese anime has been steadily entering the discourse of media studies in the U.S. as an alternative to the Hollywood film industry. This study will examine the portrayal of womanhood in Japanese anime to better understand the Japanese concept of womanhood. With the increasing amount of anime imported into the U.S., American viewers are exposed to images and narratives that are ridden with Japanese cultural values that may sometimes conflict with the western gender politic. Within the Japanese societal framework, the public sphere has been dominated by the male\\x92s voice, including that of popular culture. However, since the emergence of the sh?o (girls) manga industry during the 1960s-1970s, the female manga artists and readers seemed to have created a sphere where they could possibly resist, subvert, and reappropriate the existing patriarchal ideology that constricted them within limited social participatory roles. Depiction of womanhood in manga and anime is important not only because of the breadth of its readership and viewership in Japan, but also because they may function as an Althusserian ideological state apparatus. Manga and anime as media can function as a vehicle in maintaining the Japanese\\x92s own sense of womanhood, which may then become important tools into the insight into Japanese gender culture. I have selected the Japanese Fruits Basket television animation series because of its significance as a U.S. imported series that will be aired on Toonami in the near future. Through examining the female portrayals in anime texts, American viewers may develop a better understanding of the emerging cultural borderland of Japanese anime to the U.S. media.',\n",

Men were randomly assigned to view slides of muscular, idealized male models with no text; with text explaining how to attain the depicted body type; with irrelevant text; or no slides. The dependent measure was the number of pretzels voluntarily eaten during administration of a post-viewing questionnaire. Compared to participants who viewed no slides, participants who viewed models paired with text explaining how to attain the depicted body type ate significantly less, regardless of body mass and gender. For women only, the same effect occurred for those exposed to slides of models without text. Viewing of slides paired with irrelevant text did not result in significant reductions in eating.

This paper examines from a feminist perspective how women are portrayed on these Internet sites and extrapolates from the images some observations about the status of women in those countries.\\nThe review of the Jordan Times, the Gulf News and the Arab News found that there were three major ways in which women were most frequently portrayed: (1) as victims, (2) as \\x93angels of mercy,\\x94 and (3) as increasingly important to development of economic assets of the region. When female authority figures were represented, they were generally members of royal families and were providing either commentary on the victimization of women by the Israelis or were leaders of relief efforts aimed at helping these victims.',\n",

This symposium, in attempting to make sense of the potential implications of 'critical theory' for communication studies as a field at that time, is argued to constitute a moment of 'disciplinary self-reflection' whose subsequent employment within the communication studies literature indicates the reflexive concerns of the discipline. The analysis conducted here suggests that disciplinary self-reflection in communication studies includes both epistemological-ideological and structural-functional critiques of the discipline. This analysis underscores the tensions between two views of what communication 'in the public interest' entails: on the one hand, a gimlet-eyed appraisal of the vagaries of media power; on the other, a pragmatic and useful program that contributes to policymaking and interdisciplinary inquiry.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper, I argue that the standard media narratives about the production and distribution of \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" reinforced a number of inaccuracies and misperceptions about the operations of the contemporary media industries. These stories constructed certain dichotomies between \"Hollywood\" and \"independent\" which obscured the interconnectedness and fluidity existing within the contemporary film and television industries.\\n\\nThis paper consists of two parts. First, I survey three dominant \"claims\" made in mainstream publications about the film. In this section, I complicate assertions that the film can be labeled as the \\x93most successful independent film of all time\\x94; I challenge the assumption that film such as \\x93My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\x94 are rarely made by Hollywood anymore; and I problematize declarations that the film represents a triumph in \\x93grassroots\\x94 marketing tactics.\\n\\nSecond, I propose that the film\\'s extraordinary financial success should not be interpreted as evidence that Hollywood has lost its way, but rather as proof of the existence - and effectiveness - of specific business practices and aesthetic parameters within the contemporary media industries. Ultimately, I encourage media analysts to cease from viewing \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" as an example of one woman and one film defying the odds. Instead, we should consider the film as an example of the uniformity of journalistic discourses, the complexity of the operations of contemporary Hollywood, and the continuing ideological power of the so-called American dream.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the difference between abused and non-abused children\\x92s relationships with television characters. Abused and non-abused children between the ages of 7 and 16 years old were interviewed about their favorite television character. Analyses were conducted to investigate parasocial interactions and how they differ by abuse status (abused vs. non-abused) and gender (boys vs. girls). Findings suggested that abused children parasocially interact with their favorite TV characters less often than non-abused children. Girls were more likely to identify social behavior as an important character attribute in their favorite character, while boys were likely to report strength. Conversation topics during these parasocial interactions typically were about episode information for non-abused girls. Abused girls reported seeking and giving help as the reason why they engaged in these relationships, while non-abused girls described affective reasons.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This inquiry presented and tested a causal model predicting attitudes from a combination of variables including different forms of evidence. In addition to direct effects on attitudes, which were directly examined, the model revealed that attitudes could be predicted from a combination of message believability and source credibility ratings on the character dimension. Believability, in turn, was predicted from perceived message clarity, source character, and source competence assessments. Character was predicted from the use of evidence, source competence, and perceive message clarity. Message clarity was predicted from competence assessments. Thus, results suggested that evidence and credibility effects were somewhat complicated and influenced the ways the message was perceived as comprehensible and credible.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'International students in the United States may face a number of challenges related to the adjustment to a new cultural environment. The stress that they experience during the process of cross-cultural adaptation is called acculturative stress. The current study investigated relationship between acculturative stress among Chinese international students, social support and use of online ethnic social groups. A survey was conducted among 110 Chinese students who attended a southeast university in the United States. The results suggested that those who were more satisfied with their interpersonal social networks had less perceived discrimination, perceived hatred and negative feelings caused by change, but not less fear. Online group activity level was not significantly related to the degree of acculturative stress. However, students who experienced less acculturative stress reported receiving higher amounts of emotional and informational support from online ethnic social groups. In addition, Students who were less satisfied with interpersonal social networks tended to perceive more informational support from online groups than students who were more satisfied with interpersonal social networks.',\n",
