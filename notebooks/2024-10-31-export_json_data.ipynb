On the basis of in-depth interviews with Japanese-speaking informants in the United States, I analyze: (1) the episodes in which informants' cultural knowledge about appropriate conduct was affected or broadened by their engaging in accounting practices with American English speakers; and (2) the cases in which informants did not pursue the problematic events that they had faced with English speakers because, in reality, they saw difficulty in doing so. In the latter cases, informants' cultural knowledge and their perception of the boundaries tended to remain as they had been before the problematic events. The study supports the idea that boundaries of speech communities are dynamic but also suggests that they would not change so easily because participants often choose not to engage in accounting episodes.\",\n",

Intrinsic and extrinsic motives were operationalized as personal interest and expectations of future relevant discussion, respectively. Respondents received a manipulation that elevated the expectation of discussing certain topics with unknown students and then viewed a newscast featuring these topics. Personal interest in and information acquisition of each message were assessed, along with anticipations of topical discussion with friends or family. Results showed that intrinsic and extrinsic interests related positively to information acquisition indicators for the relevant news stories. In addition, extrinsic motives were found to influence intrinsic motives. Implications for viewing traditional media effects research in conjunction with epistemic motivation research are discussed.', 'number_of_authors': None, 'year': 2005, 'session': 'Why and How We Communication: The Role of Motivation', 'division': 'Information Systems'}\n",

Following\\nKellner\\x92s (1995) concept of \\x93ideological critique,\\x94 I first examine the narrative of Independence\\nDay through a comparison with Fight Club. Both movies portray analogous scenes of crumbling\\ntowers but in two different ideological contexts, which the comparison intends to highlight.\\nSecond, I examine the ideological subtext of Independence Day with those of two key speeches\\ngiven by president Bush. This second \\x91diagnostic\\x92 comparison offers evidence that similar\\nideologies underlie the narrative in Independence Day and Bush\\x92s speeches. I argue, therefore,\\nthat the intertextual references between Independence Day and the World Trade Center tragedy\\nwere functional in activating and promoting the hegemonic ascent of an interpretive framework\\nthat is consistent with the one proposed by the Bush administration.', 'number_of_authors': None, 'year': 2005, 'session': 'Intertextual Narratives of Time and Space', 'division': 'Popular Communication'}\n",
